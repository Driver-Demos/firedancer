Building, Running, and Configuring Firedancer
=============================================

This section describes how to build the project using Makefile-driven steps, initialize the validator processes, and configure key runtime parameters. It is organized into three sections: Build Process, Initialization, and Configuration.

Build System
------------

The Firedancer build system is modular, configurable, and automated to compile, test, and package the validator client. It employs GNU Makefiles, Cargo build scripts, and GitHub Actions workflows for reproducible builds across C, C++/ASM, and Rust. Conditional compilation flags, machine-specific configurations, and integrated code generation ensure that builds are robust and optimized.

```
    graph LR
        A[Start: Initiate Build Process] --> B[Module-specific Builds]
        B --> C[Conditional Compilation & Configuration]
        C --> D[Dependency Resolution & Code Generation]
        D --> E[Integration of Rust & Cargo Builds]
        E --> F[Continuous Integration via GitHub Actions]
        F --> G[Testing: Unit, Integration, Fuzz, Coverage]
        G --> H[Packaging & Artifact Generation]
```



|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Common Issue | Cause | Resolution |
| Incorrect or missing compile-time flags | Required environment variables or Makefile macros not properly set | Verify and set the necessary flags via command-line or configuration files; ensure MACHINE and EXTRAS variables reference valid configuration fragments. |
| Stale or corrupt build artifacts | Outdated object files or generated dependencies interfere with rebuilds | Run `make clean` or `make distclean` for Makefile-based modules and `cargo clean` for Rust projects before rebuilding. |
| Dependency mismatches or missing libraries | External libraries (e.g., OpenSSL, RocksDB) or Rust crate versions misconfigured | Re-execute the dependency script (e.g., `./deps.sh +dev`), verify system packages are in expected directories, and review Cargo.toml version specifications. |
| Failing tests during integration | Misconfiguration, missing autogenerated files, or outdated CI settings | Review CI logs and build output, confirm autogenerated files (version headers, Protocol Buffer bindings) are current, and run targeted tests (e.g., `make run-unit-test`). |
| Linking errors or unresolved symbols | Incorrect integration between Cargo and native libraries | Confirm that build scripts (e.g., build.rs) emit the proper linking directives (e.g., cargo:rustc-link-lib) and that native libraries are correctly compiled and linked. |

Validator Initialization and Configuration
------------------------------------------

Firedancer’s validator initialization is a multi-stage process that handles boot-time system checks, runtime state initialization, genesis block creation, key management, network setup, and final configuration via TOML files. These steps ensure a secure and consistent boot process for both the Firedancer and Frankendancer variants.

#### CPU Affinity and Thread Priority Example

This C code snippet assigns CPU affinity and sets thread priority:

```
    if (tile->cpu_idx != ULONG_MAX) {
        fd_cpuset_insert(&cpuset, tile->cpu_idx);
        setpriority(PRIO_PROCESS, 0, -19);
    }
```

By combining these tuning mechanisms, Firedancer allows for optimal performance tailored to varied hardware environments.

Testing and Quality Assurance
=============================

Firedancer employs a rigorous testing framework to ensure the correctness, security, and performance of its validator client. Testing methodologies include unit tests, integration and simulation tests, fuzz testing, sanitizers, and static analysis, integrated within a CI/CD pipeline to catch issues early.

Table of Test Types and Their Purposes
--------------------------------------

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Test Type | Purpose |
| Unit Testing | Validate individual modules (e.g., cryptographic functions, virtual machine operations, data structures) through assertions and dedicated macros. |
| Integration & Simulation Testing | Verify end-to-end workflows such as ledger replay, multi-tile execution, and hardware simulation to ensure correct module interactions. |
| Fuzz Testing | Uncover edge cases and potential security vulnerabilities by passing randomized or adversarial inputs through critical components. |
| Sanitizers & Static Analysis | Use tools like AddressSanitizer and CodeQL to detect memory errors, uninitialized data, and other runtime issues. |
| Code Coverage & Pre-commit Hygiene | Enforce stringent code formatting and measure test coverage to ensure code quality before commits. |

Running Tests Locally
---------------------

Firedancer provides standardized Makefile targets and scripts to run tests:

* **Unit Tests:**
    
```
        make run-unit-test
```
    
* **Integration Tests:**
    
```
        make run-integration-test
```
    
* **Fuzz Tests:**

This comprehensive testing approach ensures that code changes meet the rigorous standards required for secure and high-performance blockchain operations.

Security and Robustness
=======================

Firedancer is architected with a multi-layered defense strategy to secure validator operations in a hostile blockchain environment. This is achieved through secure coding practices, stringent cryptographic safeguards, limited system call exposure, and continual monitoring via automated testing.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Security Practice | Guideline and Implementation Details |
| Seccomp Filtering & System Call Restrictions | Enforces a narrow system call whitelist using automatically generated BPF-based seccomp policies, immediately terminating processes with unexpected syscalls. |
| Cryptographic Integrity & Protocol Enforcement | Implements multiple cryptographic algorithms in constant-time, ensures secure key handling (with explicit zeroing and memory fences), and validates protocol buffers to prevent overruns. |
| Defensive Coding and Input Validation | Checks for null pointers, validates magic numbers, performs boundary checks, and employs safe serialization/deserialization routines to ensure data remains within expected limits. |
| Automated Testing, Fuzzing & Static Analysis | Uses unit tests, fuzzers, sanitizers, and static analysis tools to continuously detect vulnerabilities and memory mismanagement before deployment. |
| Hardened Build & Deployment Configurations | Employs secure build flags (e.g., -fstack-protector-strong, -pie), strict dependency checks, and specialized fuzzer configurations to minimize vulnerable code paths. |

Additional practices include using unified error codes and standardized logging macros (FD_LOG_ERR, FD_LOG_WARNING) to facilitate rapid troubleshooting while maintaining a fail-fast, secure operational posture.

Troubleshooting and Support
===========================

If issues arise, the following table and support channels provide guidance for troubleshooting and escalation:

Common Issues and Recommended Solutions
---------------------------------------

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Issue | Troubleshooting Steps / Solution |
| **Configuration Parsing Errors** | • Verify that TOML configuration files adhere strictly to the expected syntax.  <br>• Run tests (e.g., using test_config_parse.c) and review error logs from fd_config_parse.c/ fd_config_private.h. |
| **Boot and Logging Failures** | • Check that boot processes capture and log startup variables and configuration details.  <br>• Inspect log files for early misconfiguration signs during startup. |
| **Ledger and Blockstore Misconfigurations** | • Run ledger tests (e.g., test_ledger_backtest.sh) to identify data ingestion issues.  <br>• Verify Local.mk, solcap, and snapshot parameters; watch for “Bank hash mismatch” messages. |
| **Diff Generation Mismatches** | • Confirm that both Firedancer and Solana solcap files are generated before running diff comparisons.  <br>• Review logs for discrepancies regarding ledger paths and slot parameters. |
| **VM Execution and Invalid Opcode Errors** | • Use disassembly outputs from fd_vm_disasm.c and review mappings in fd_vm_interp_jump_table.c.  <br>• Validate memory alignment, confirm non-null pointers, and check that FD_VM_MAGIC is correct. |
| **SBPF Trace Issues** | • Ensure that the SBPF debug flag is enabled (verify that with-tracing.mk appends `-DFD_DEBUG_SBPF_TRACES=1`).  <br>• Check that detailed SBPF trace outputs are generated during compilation. |
| **Cryptographic and Account Errors** | • For signature and public key errors (e.g., FD_ED25519_ERR_SIG), consult fd_ed25519_strerror for descriptions.  <br>• For account errors, review fd_acc_mgr.c/h and use fd_acc_mgr_strerror. |
| **Shared Memory and Workspace Errors** | • If errors like “No wksp containing shmem found” occur, use fd_wksp_containing and fd_wksp_laddr to verify workspace integrity.  <br>• Confirm that shared memory regions are correctly initialized and mapped. |
| **Network, I/O, and Advanced Interface Issues** | • For NIC issues (e.g., AF_XDP, UMEM registration failures), verify ring depths, offsets, and alignment.  <br>• For asynchronous I/O or Netlink errors, check parameters and review helper outputs (fd_netlink_iter_next, fd_aio_strerror).  <br>• For TLS/SSL problems, refer to fd_openssl_ssl_strerror for error mapping. |
| **CLI and Offline Replay Discrepancies** | • Use built-in CLI help commands (as defined in help.c/h) to confirm usage and configuration.  <br>• Run offline replay scripts (e.g., run_offline_replay.sh) and review log outputs for configuration or IPC attachment issues. |
