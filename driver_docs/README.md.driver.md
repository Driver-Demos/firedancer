# Purpose
The provided content is a markdown file that serves as an introductory and informational document for the Firedancer project, a validator client for the Solana blockchain. This file provides a broad overview of the project's purpose, features, and development instructions, making it essential for developers and operators interested in using or contributing to Firedancer. It outlines the project's key attributes—speed, security, and independence—and introduces two validators, Frankendancer and Firedancer, detailing their current status and availability. Additionally, the document includes development instructions for setting up the Firedancer environment on a Linux system, emphasizing the need for a specific kernel version and providing a step-by-step guide to clone and build the project. The file also mentions licensing information, indicating that Firedancer is distributed under the Apache 2 license, which is crucial for understanding the legal use and distribution of the software.
# Content Summary
The provided content is a comprehensive overview of the Firedancer project, a new validator client for the Solana blockchain. Firedancer is designed to be fast, secure, and independent, drawing on expertise from the low latency trading space to optimize performance. It is built from scratch to enhance client diversity and mitigate risks associated with supply chain attacks.

The document outlines two main validators produced by the Firedancer project: Frankendancer and Firedancer. Frankendancer is a hybrid validator that combines components from both Firedancer and Agave, utilizing Firedancer's networking stack and block production for improved performance. It is currently available on Solana's testnet and mainnet-beta. The full Firedancer validator, which is entirely independent of Agave code, is still under development and not yet ready for test or production use.

For developers, the document provides instructions for setting up the development environment, which requires a Linux system with a kernel version of at least 4.18. The setup process involves cloning the repository, running a script to set up dependencies, and using `make` to build and run the validator. The `fddev dev` command is used to configure the system, create necessary blockchain components, and start a local validator. Developers can also configure the system to join an existing development cluster by specifying `rpc.entrypoints` in the configuration file.

The document also mentions that Firedancer is licensed under the Apache 2 license, with some external libraries included under various licenses. For more detailed information, users are directed to the LICENSE file. Additionally, links to the Firedancer documentation and release guides are provided for operators interested in running the validator.
