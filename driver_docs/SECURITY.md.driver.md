# Purpose
The document is a security policy outline for the Firedancer software project, detailing its approach to ensuring the security and integrity of its codebase. It includes a structured overview of the Firedancer security program, highlighting key components such as the Bug Bounty Program, Third Party Security Audits, and an Audit Contest. The Bug Bounty Program encourages the reporting of security-relevant bugs through the Immunefi platform, offering potential rewards for valid submissions. The document also emphasizes the role of third-party security audits, which are conducted to independently assess the software's security, with audit reports made publicly available once issues are resolved. Additionally, it mentions an audit contest held on Immunefi, aimed at further scrutinizing the software before its mainnet launch.
