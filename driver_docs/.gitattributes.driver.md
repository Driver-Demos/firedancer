# Purpose
This file is a `.gitattributes` configuration file used in a Git repository to manage how certain files are treated by Git. It specifies that files matching certain patterns, such as those with paths containing `src/flamenco/types/` and `contrib/test/test-vectors-fixtures/`, should be marked as linguist-generated or binary, affecting how they are displayed in diffs and potentially ignored by language statistics tools.
