# Purpose
The provided content is a code style guide for the Firedancer project, which is a document outlining the conventions and best practices for writing code within this specific codebase. This guide is not a configuration file but rather a documentation file that provides narrow functionality by focusing on coding standards. It covers various conceptual categories such as text formatting, file organization, spacing rules, type system, function documentation, macro usage, portability, and security practices. The common theme is to ensure consistency, readability, and maintainability of the code. The relevance of this document to the codebase is significant as it serves as a reference for developers contributing to the project, ensuring that all code adheres to a unified style, which facilitates collaboration and reduces errors.
# Content Summary
The "Firedancer Code Style Guide" is a comprehensive document outlining the coding conventions and best practices for contributors to the Firedancer codebase. It is not an authoritative source, as the code style is primarily defined by the code in `src/tango`. The guide emphasizes manual code formatting over automated tools and provides detailed instructions on various aspects of code style.

### Key Sections and Guidelines:

1. **General Guidelines**:
   - **Text Word Wrap**: Comments should be wrapped at 72 columns for readability.
   - **Organization**: Avoid cluttering the repository root and refer to `organization.txt` for more details.
   - **File Extensions**: Specific extensions are designated for different file types, such as `.c` for C translation units and `.h` for header files.
   - **Include Guards**: Use `ifndef` include guards in header files instead of `#pragma once`.

2. **Code Formatting**:
   - **Vertical Alignment**: Encourages vertical alignment for readability, especially in variable declarations and macro definitions.
   - **Spacing Rules**: Specific rules for spacing in function calls, control flow statements, and function prototypes to maintain consistency and readability.

3. **Type System**:
   - **Integers**: Use types from `fd_util_base.h` instead of `stdint.h`.
   - **Bools**: Use `int` for boolean values, with `1` as true and `0` as false.

4. **Function Documentation**:
   - Functions should be documented before their prototypes, especially for public APIs, to facilitate automated documentation extraction.

5. **Macros**:
   - Recommendations for macro definitions include enclosing arguments in braces and using `do/while(0)` for macro bodies to ensure safe and predictable behavior.

6. **Portability**:
   - Firedancer aims to be compatible with LP64 environments and supports various build environments and architectures, including x86_64 and experimental support for others like arm64 and macOS.

7. **Security**:
   - Emphasizes fuzz testing and graceful error handling. It also provides strategies for managing complex function exits to ensure resources are properly released.

This guide serves as a crucial resource for developers contributing to the Firedancer project, ensuring code consistency, readability, and maintainability across the codebase.
