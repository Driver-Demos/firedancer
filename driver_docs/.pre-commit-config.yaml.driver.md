# Purpose
This YAML configuration file is used by the pre-commit framework to define a repository of pre-commit hooks. It specifies the repository URL, the version to use (`v5.0.0`), and a specific hook (`trailing-whitespace`) that should be executed, excluding files in the specified directories (`^src/disco/gui/dist/` and `^src/flamenco/types/fixtures/`).
