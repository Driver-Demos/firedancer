# Purpose
The provided content is a section from a documentation file that guides users on how to set up and develop a local documentation site using VitePress. It outlines the initial steps required to get started, including installing the Bun JavaScript runtime, ensuring it is available in the system's PATH, and setting the correct working directory. The instructions then guide the user through installing dependencies and running the development server with Bun. Additionally, it provides a note for users who may be working on a remote host, instructing them on how to expose the development server endpoint. This setup allows users to serve and view a local version of the documentation site for development and testing purposes.
