# Purpose
This code is a configuration file for a VitePress project, which is a static site generator powered by Vite. It imports the default theme from VitePress and applies custom styles through an external CSS file named `custom.css`. The file exports the `DefaultTheme`, indicating that it is intended to customize the appearance of a VitePress site by extending or modifying the default theme with additional styles. This code provides narrow functionality focused on theming and styling, rather than broader application logic or functionality.
