# Purpose
The provided content is a documentation file for the Firedancer project, which is a new Solana validator being developed by Jump Trading Group. This document serves as an overview and guide for operators and administrators familiar with the Agave validator, detailing the purpose, goals, and current status of the Firedancer project. Firedancer aims to enhance Solana's performance by eliminating software inefficiencies and leveraging Jump's expertise in high-capacity, low-latency networks. The document outlines the project's incremental development approach, including the current implementation of networking and block distribution components, and the integration with existing Agave code, referred to as "Frankendancer." It also provides guidance on running Firedancer in a testnet environment, highlights the project's open-source nature, and invites community contributions. The document is crucial for understanding the Firedancer project's objectives, development status, and operational instructions, making it a key resource for those involved in deploying and maintaining Solana validators.
# Content Summary
The document provides an overview of the Firedancer project, an initiative by Jump Trading Group aimed at enhancing the Solana blockchain's performance and reliability. Firedancer is designed to replicate Solana's functionality with improved performance by eliminating software inefficiencies and maximizing hardware capabilities. It serves as a second validator codebase, reducing the risk of a single point of failure and enhancing network robustness. Unlike the original Solana validator written in Rust, Firedancer is developed in C, which diversifies the security model and reduces the likelihood of vulnerabilities affecting the entire network.

Firedancer is being developed incrementally, with the current focus on integrating its high-performance networking layer with the existing Agave runtime and consensus code, a configuration known as "Frankendancer." This setup allows for testing and deployment before the full implementation of the Solana protocol. Key components already implemented in Firedancer include QUIC and UDP ingress networking, block distribution engine, signature verification, and block packing logic. The project aims to deliver a fully independent validator by the end of 2024.

The document also serves as a guide for operators and administrators familiar with running an Agave validator, as Firedancer relies on similar concepts and components. It provides instructions for setting up and running a Firedancer validator node, which is currently in beta and under active development. The Firedancer team encourages community contributions and provides support through the Solana Tech Discord channel. The project is open source, licensed under the Apache-2.0 license, and includes external libraries with various licenses.
