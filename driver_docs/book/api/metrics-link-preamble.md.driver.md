# Purpose
The provided content is a snippet from a configuration file that defines metrics for monitoring data queues, referred to as "links," between different components, or "tiles," in a software system. These links are characterized as single-producer multi-consumer, meaning one producer can have multiple consumers, each of which reports metrics independently. The metrics are defined using Prometheus-style syntax, where `link_published_size_bytes` is a counter metric that tracks the total number of bytes read by each link consumer. The metrics are labeled with four identifiers: `kind` and `kind_id` to specify the consumer tile, and `link_kind` and `link_kind_id` to specify the link being consumed. This setup allows for detailed monitoring and analysis of data flow between components in the system.
