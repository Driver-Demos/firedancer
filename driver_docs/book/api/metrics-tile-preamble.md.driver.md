# Purpose
The provided content is a documentation snippet explaining the structure and purpose of performance counter metrics for QUIC connections in a multi-core system. These metrics are collected per tile, where a tile represents a CPU core assigned to handle QUIC connections. Each metric is reported separately for each tile, identified by two labels: `kind`, which specifies the type of tile (in this case, "quic"), and `kind_id`, which indicates the specific index of the tile. The metrics include counters such as `quic_connections_created` and `quic_connections_aborted`, which track the total number of connections created and aborted, respectively, for each tile. This setup allows for detailed performance monitoring and analysis of QUIC connections across different CPU cores.
