# Purpose
The provided content is a comprehensive metrics documentation file, likely formatted in Markdown, which details various performance and operational metrics for a software system. This file serves as a reference for monitoring and analyzing the system's behavior, providing insights into different components such as network operations, transaction processing, and system health. The metrics are organized into conceptual categories or "tiles," each focusing on a specific aspect of the system, such as network links, transactions, or gossip protocols. Each metric is described with a name, type (e.g., counter, gauge, histogram), and a detailed description of what it measures. This file is crucial for developers and system administrators to understand the system's performance, diagnose issues, and optimize operations, making it a vital part of the codebase's observability and monitoring infrastructure.
# Content Summary
The provided content is a comprehensive documentation of various metrics used in a software system, likely for monitoring and performance analysis. The metrics are organized into different categories or "tiles," each representing a specific aspect of the system's operation. Here's a breakdown of the key sections and their purposes:

1. **All Links**: This section tracks metrics related to link consumption and performance, such as the number of fragments consumed, filtered, and overrun during polling and reading operations.

2. **All Tiles**: This section includes metrics for process and thread management, context switches, status, heartbeat, and backpressure conditions. It also tracks the duration spent in various operational regimes.

3. **Net Tile**: This section focuses on network-related metrics, including packet transmission and reception counts, bytes transferred, and issues like packet drops due to backpressure or route failures.

4. **Quic Tile**: This section monitors QUIC protocol operations, including transaction reassembly, packet reception and transmission, connection management, and frame processing.

5. **Bundle Tile**: This section tracks metrics related to transaction bundles, including received transactions, errors encountered, and workspace heap management.

6. **Verify Tile**: This section focuses on transaction verification metrics, including failures due to parsing, deduplication, and peer transaction issues.

7. **Dedup Tile**: This section tracks deduplication metrics, including failures and transactions received over gossip.

8. **Resolv Tile**: This section monitors transaction resolution metrics, including issues with bank availability, stash operations, and address lookup table resolutions.

9. **Pack Tile**: This section covers metrics related to transaction scheduling and packing, including microblock scheduling, transaction insertion results, and timing states.

10. **Bank Tile**: This section tracks metrics related to transaction execution within a bank, including failures, slot acquisition, and address lookup table loading.

11. **Poh Tile**: This section monitors Proof of History (PoH) metrics, including delays in slot leadership and microblock processing.

12. **Shred Tile**: This section focuses on metrics related to data shredding, including microblock abandonment, batch sizes, and processing results.

13. **Store Tile**: This section tracks the number of transactions inserted while the system was a leader.

14. **Replay Tile**: This section includes metrics related to slot replaying, though specific descriptions are not provided.

15. **Storei Tile**: This section tracks turbine slot metrics, though specific descriptions are not provided.

16. **Gossip Tile**: This section monitors gossip protocol metrics, including message reception and transmission, peer counts, and CRDS value processing.

17. **Netlnk Tile**: This section focuses on netlink metrics, including drop events, syncs, and updates related to network interfaces and routes.

18. **Sock Tile**: This section tracks socket-related metrics, including syscall counts for sending and receiving messages, and packet transmission and reception.

19. **Repair Tile**: This section monitors repair-related metrics, including packet reception and transmission, and server message types.

20. **Send Tile**: This section tracks metrics related to sending transactions to leaders, including issues with leader schedule and contact information.

Each metric is defined with a name, type (counter, gauge, or histogram), and a description explaining its purpose. This detailed documentation is crucial for developers and system administrators to monitor system performance, diagnose issues, and optimize operations.
