# Purpose
The provided content is a documentation excerpt detailing the configuration and usage of performance metrics in the Firedancer software. It explains that Firedancer maintains internal performance counters for developers and monitoring tools, which are exposed through a Prometheus HTTP endpoint. The configuration snippet in TOML format specifies the port (7999) on which the Prometheus metrics are accessible. The document includes an example of how to retrieve these metrics using a curl command, showcasing the `gauge` metric type with process IDs for different components. Additionally, it warns that these metrics are intended for developer and diagnostic purposes only, and may change without notice. The document also outlines the three types of metrics supported by Firedancer, adhering to the Prometheus data model: `counter`, `gauge`, and `histogram`.
