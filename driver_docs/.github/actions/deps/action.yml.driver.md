# Purpose
The provided file is a configuration script for a GitHub Actions workflow, designed to build and cache software dependencies efficiently. It defines a set of inputs, such as paths to scripts (`deps.sh` and `deps-bundle.sh`), compiler options, and additional flags, which are required for the execution of the workflow. The workflow consists of several steps, including checking for the presence of `apt-get`, updating package lists, calculating a hash for caching purposes, and determining whether to use cached dependencies or install them from scratch. The caching mechanism is implemented using the `corca-ai/local-cache` action, which helps optimize build times by storing and reusing previously built dependencies. This setup ensures that dependencies are managed in a consistent and efficient manner, leveraging caching to reduce redundant installations and improve the overall build process.
