# Purpose
The provided content is a configuration file for a GitHub Action workflow, specifically designed to manage caching for a submodule named "agave." This file defines several inputs, such as the machine type, C compiler, and compiler version, which are required for the build process, with default values and options specified for each. The workflow is set to run using a composite action, consisting of steps that first determine the commit hash of the "agave" submodule and then utilize a caching action to store or restore the build artifacts. The caching mechanism is configured to use a key that incorporates the machine type, compiler, compiler version, and submodule commit hash, ensuring that the cache is uniquely identified and can be efficiently managed.
