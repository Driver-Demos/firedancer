# Purpose
The provided file is a configuration script designed to set up huge pages and gigantic pages on a system, which are types of memory pages used to optimize memory management for large data sets. The script is configured to run using a composite action, likely within a CI/CD pipeline or automation tool, and it specifies inputs for the number of huge and gigantic pages, with default values of 128 and 64, respectively. The script executes a series of shell commands to initialize, reset, and allocate the specified number of huge and gigantic pages, ensuring that the system's current allocation meets or exceeds the input values. It also adjusts permissions on a specific directory to ensure the user has the necessary access rights. This setup is crucial for applications that require efficient memory usage and performance improvements by reducing the overhead of managing smaller memory pages.
