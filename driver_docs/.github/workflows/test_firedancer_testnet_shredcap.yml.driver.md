# Purpose
The provided content is a GitHub Actions workflow configuration file written in YAML format. This file defines a CI/CD pipeline named "Firedancer Testnet Shredcap" that is triggered either by a workflow call with specific inputs or manually via workflow dispatch. The workflow consists of a single job, "firedancer-testnet-shredcap," which runs on a self-hosted machine with specific hardware requirements and a 30-minute timeout. The job sets up the environment, checks out the code, installs dependencies, configures system resources like huge pages, builds the project using `make`, and performs a series of tasks including setting up a repository, running a replay test, and cleaning up resources. The workflow is designed to automate the testing and validation of the Firedancer project in a controlled environment, ensuring that the software functions correctly under specified conditions.
