# Purpose
The provided content is a GitHub Actions workflow configuration file written in YAML format. This file defines a workflow named "On Pull Request" that is triggered by events related to pull requests, specifically when they are synchronized, opened, reopened, or marked as ready for review. The workflow includes a concurrency control mechanism to ensure that only one instance of the workflow runs per pull request, canceling any in-progress runs if a new event occurs. It specifies several jobs—`tests`, `ledgers`, and `backtest`—which are executed only if the pull request is not in draft status. Each job references an external YAML file located in the `.github/workflows` directory, inheriting any secrets defined in the repository. Additionally, there are commented-out sections for potential future jobs related to "firedancer" testing, indicating areas for possible expansion or modification of the workflow.
