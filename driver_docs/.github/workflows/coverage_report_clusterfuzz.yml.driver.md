# Purpose
The provided configuration file is a GitHub Actions workflow designed to generate a coverage report using the ClusterFuzz corpus. This workflow is triggered by a `workflow_call` event and is intended to complement the main coverage report by incorporating data from ClusterFuzz, which continuously discovers new fuzzing targets. The job, named "Coverage Report (ClusterFuzz)," runs on the latest Ubuntu environment and is configured to execute within a 60-minute timeout. It involves several steps, including checking out the repository, authenticating with Google Cloud, building the project, replacing the corpus directory with data from ClusterFuzz, generating the fuzz coverage report, and finally uploading the report to CodeCov. The use of environment variables and secrets ensures secure and efficient execution of the workflow.
