# Purpose
The provided file is a GitHub Actions workflow configuration written in YAML, designed to automate a nightly CodeQL analysis for a codebase. The workflow is triggered either manually or by other workflows, as specified by `workflow_dispatch` and `workflow_call`. It grants write permissions to security events, indicating its focus on security analysis. The workflow defines a job named "analyze" that runs on a machine labeled "1T" and uses a matrix strategy to handle different configurations, such as language, compiler, and machine type. The job includes several steps: checking out the code, setting up dependencies, cleaning build targets, initializing CodeQL, and performing the analysis. The configuration is tailored to support C/C++ analysis using Clang, with specific build modes and compiler versions, and it includes custom actions and submodules to manage dependencies and build processes.
