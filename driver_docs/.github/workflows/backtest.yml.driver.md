# Purpose
The provided content is a GitHub Actions workflow configuration file written in YAML format. This file defines a workflow named "Replay Ledgers" that can be triggered either by a workflow call or manually via a workflow dispatch. It specifies inputs such as `coverage`, `machine`, and `extras`, with default values set for each. The workflow includes a job named `backtest-ledger-replay` that runs on a self-hosted runner with specific hardware requirements. The job sets up the environment variables and executes a series of steps, including checking out the code repository, setting up dependencies, building the project using `make`, and running a backtest on ledger replays. The workflow is designed to automate the testing and validation of ledger replay functionality within the codebase, ensuring that changes do not introduce regressions or errors.
