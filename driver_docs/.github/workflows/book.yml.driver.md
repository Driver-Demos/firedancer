# Purpose
The provided file is a GitHub Actions workflow configuration designed to automate the deployment of a VitePress-based documentation site to GitHub Pages. The workflow is triggered manually via the GitHub Actions tab and is structured to ensure that only one deployment runs at a time without canceling any in-progress deployments. It consists of two main jobs: a build job and a deployment job. The build job checks out the repository, sets up the necessary environment, installs dependencies, builds the site using VitePress, and uploads the build artifacts. The deployment job, which depends on the successful completion of the build job, then deploys the site to GitHub Pages, making it publicly accessible. This configuration ensures a streamlined and automated process for maintaining and updating the documentation site.
