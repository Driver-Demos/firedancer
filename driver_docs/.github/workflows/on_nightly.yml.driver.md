# Purpose
The provided content is a GitHub Actions workflow configuration file written in YAML format. This file defines a workflow named "On Nightly" that is triggered either manually via `workflow_dispatch` or automatically on a schedule at 4 AM daily, as specified by the cron expression. The workflow consists of three jobs: `coverage-report`, `codeql`, and `builds`. Each job references a separate YAML file located in the `.github/workflows` directory, which contains the specific instructions for that job. The `coverage-report` job inherits secrets, the `codeql` job is granted write permissions to security events, and the `builds` job includes specific parameters for handling different compiler and machine configurations, with options for verbosity and ARM architecture builds. This setup is typically used to automate testing, security analysis, and building processes in a continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline.
