# Purpose
The provided file is a GitHub Actions workflow configuration written in YAML format. Its purpose is to automate the process of checking for trailing whitespace in files that are part of a pull request. The workflow is triggered by the `pull_request` event and runs on the `ubuntu-latest` environment. It consists of a job named `check`, which first checks out the repository's code and identifies the files that have changed in the pull request. It then sets up a Python environment and uses the `pre-commit` GitHub Action to run checks specifically on the changed files, passing any additional arguments needed to focus on trailing whitespace issues. This ensures that any trailing whitespace is identified and can be addressed before merging the pull request.
