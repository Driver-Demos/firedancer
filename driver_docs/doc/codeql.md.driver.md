# Purpose
The provided content is a quickstart guide for running CodeQL queries against a CodeQL database hosted on GitHub for the Firedancer repository. It outlines the necessary steps and requirements for setting up a local environment to perform these queries, emphasizing that the process should be conducted locally rather than through remote environments like VSCode Remote SSH. The guide specifies prerequisites such as having Visual Studio Code installed and access to the firedancer-io organization. It provides detailed instructions on downloading and installing the CodeQL bundle, configuring the environment, and setting up the VSCode extension to interact with the CodeQL database. Additionally, it offers an alternative method for creating a CodeQL database from scratch, which involves using a build directory and executing a command to generate the database, highlighting the need to recreate the database upon source code changes.
