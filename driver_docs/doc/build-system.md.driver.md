# Purpose
The provided content is a detailed documentation of the build system for the Firedancer project, which is a software codebase. This document serves as a guide for users to understand the philosophy and technical details behind building Firedancer from source, emphasizing simplicity and robustness for GNU/Linux distributions. It outlines the build process, which involves transforming C/C++ and assembly source code into static objects, libraries, and executable binaries, using tools like GCC or Clang. The document also discusses system dependencies, ABI stability, code generation, and out-of-tree dependencies, highlighting the project's aim to minimize external dependencies and maintain cross-compiler stability. Additionally, it describes the use of GNU Make to automate the build process, detailing steps such as generating compiler configurations, performing compiler checks, and executing build rules. This file is crucial for developers and users who need to compile Firedancer from source, ensuring they have a comprehensive understanding of the build system and its requirements.
# Content Summary
The document provides a comprehensive overview of the build system and source code management for the Firedancer project. It emphasizes the importance of building Firedancer from source to ensure simplicity and robustness, particularly on GNU/Linux distributions. The build process is typical of a statically linked C application for Linux, transforming source code into release artifacts through a series of steps involving C/C++ sources, assembly sources, and embedded files, which are compiled into static objects, libraries, and executable binaries.

Compile units in Firedancer consist of C/C++ files, assembly files, and embedded files, which are compiled into static objects using GCC or Clang. These units are position-independent to support Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) and define externally linked symbols for use across other compile units. Embedded files are included using the `.incbin` assembler directive, facilitating the inclusion of binary content like eBPF programs and large text files.

Firedancer relies on system dependencies such as the GNU C Library (glibc) and the C++ standard library, which are dynamically linked. The project does not aim for ABI stability, allowing symbols to change between versions, although some parts offer a stable ABI for shared library use. Code generation tools, written in Python 3.9, generate C code that is checked into the repository to minimize tooling dependencies.

The project strives for zero out-of-tree library dependencies, though some large external dependencies are still fetched externally using a `deps.sh` script. This script builds and installs these dependencies into a custom prefix, simplifying the discovery process for the compiler without the need for complex configuration scripts.

GNU Make is used to automate the build process, which involves generating compiler and linker configurations, performing compiler checks, discovering build targets, and executing build rules. The `config/machine` directory allows for the selection of different machine types via the `MACHINE` variable, tailoring the build process to specific hardware configurations.
