# Purpose
This document is a markdown file that serves as an installation guide for setting up `XDP` and `AF_XDP` based networking, specifically for the Firedancer application. It provides a narrow functionality focused on configuring these Linux kernel technologies to enhance network performance by enabling fast userspace networking. The file is structured into several conceptual components, including prerequisites, an introduction to the technologies, and detailed installation steps. The common theme is to guide system administrators through the process of setting up a network environment that leverages `XDP` and `AF_XDP` for efficient packet processing. This file is relevant to the codebase as it ensures that the necessary environment and configurations are in place for the application to function optimally, particularly in terms of network performance.
# Content Summary
The document is an installation guide for setting up `XDP` and `AF_XDP` based networking systems, which are advanced Linux kernel technologies designed for efficient userspace networking. The guide is intended for system administrators and assumes that preliminary steps outlined in a separate `getting-started.md` document have been completed. It emphasizes the need for a recent Linux kernel (version 4.18 or higher) to leverage the latest improvements in these technologies.

`XDP` (eXpress Data Path) and `AF_XDP` are introduced as alternatives to traditional sockets-based networking, offering more efficient data handling by interacting directly with network hardware. The document clarifies the distinct roles of `XDP` and `AF_XDP`: `XDP` is used to redirect traffic away from the standard kernel networking stack, while `AF_XDP` facilitates traffic forwarding between the kernel and userland applications.

The guide explains the integration of `XDP` and `AF_XDP` with a network application called Firedancer. An `XDP` program intercepts incoming traffic on a network interface, filtering and directing relevant packets to `AF_XDP`, which then communicates with Firedancer. Outgoing packets from Firedancer are sent back through `AF_XDP` directly to the network driver, bypassing `XDP`.

A diagram is provided to illustrate the data flow between the network interface card (NIC), driver, `XDP`, `AF_XDP`, and Firedancer. The document also notes the requirement for `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` and `CAP_NET_ADMIN` capabilities for configuring `XDP` and `AF_XDP`, with `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` being necessary at runtime until the socket configuration is complete.

The installation section begins with a preparation step to confirm the kernel version using the `uname` command, ensuring compatibility with the required kernel features. The document also references additional resources, such as the `fd_xsk.h` header file, for further technical details.
