## Files
- **[integer-types.md](rant/integer-types.md.driver.md)**: The `integer-types.md` file discusses the rationale behind defining custom integer types in the `firedancer` codebase instead of using `stdint.h`, emphasizing developer expectations, platform consistency, and reducing code complexity and errors.
- **[omit-frame-pointer.md](rant/omit-frame-pointer.md.driver.md)**: The `omit-frame-pointer.md` file discusses the historical and current relevance of the `-fomit-frame-pointer` compile flag, particularly in the context of x86 and x86_64 architectures on Linux.
