Configuration for pre-commit hooks to remove trailing whitespace, excluding specific directories.

# Purpose
The file configures pre-commit hooks for a code repository. It specifies a repository URL `https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks` and uses the version `v5.0.0`. It includes a hook with the ID `trailing-whitespace`, which checks for trailing whitespace in files. The `exclude` field specifies directories to exclude from this check, namely `^src/disco/gui/dist/` and `^src/flamenco/types/fixtures/`.
