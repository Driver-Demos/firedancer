Documentation of the Firedancer source tree structure and important files.

# Purpose
The Firedancer source tree is organized into several directories, each serving a specific purpose within the codebase. The `build/` directory contains build artifacts, including binaries, coverage reports, and static libraries, which are essential for compiling and testing the software. The `contrib/` directory provides developer tools, such as code generation scripts and test scripts, facilitating development and testing processes. The `src/` directory is the main source tree, housing various components like `app/` for main binaries, `ballet/` for interoperability standards, and `choreo/` for consensus components. Additionally, the `opt/` directory manages third-party dependencies, ensuring that external libraries and headers are available for the build process. Important files like `README.md` and test launchers in `contrib/test/` provide essential information and tools for setting up and testing the software.
# Content Summary
The provided content outlines the structure of the Firedancer source tree, which is organized into several directories, each serving a specific purpose within the software codebase. Below is a summary of the key components and their functions:

1. **Documentation and Build Artifacts**:
   - `book/`: Contains links to the Firedancer documentation.
   - `build/`: Stores build artifacts, including binaries, coverage reports, headers, static libraries, object files, and test binaries. The `native/gcc` subdirectory specifies the build profile.

2. **Configuration and Developer Tools**:
   - `config/`: Contains the build system configuration files, specifically for GNU Make.
   - `contrib/`: Includes developer tooling such as code generation scripts, test scripts, and configuration files for developer tools.

3. **Fuzz Testing and Frontend**:
   - `corpus/`: Holds the fuzz seed corpus.
   - `dump/`: Contains fuzz regression vectors and ledger archives.
   - `frontend/`: Contains the Firedancer graphical user interface (GUI).

4. **Third-party Dependencies**:
   - `opt/`: Manages third-party dependencies, including repositories, headers, and libraries.

5. **Source Code**:
   - `src/`: The main source tree for Firedancer, containing several subdirectories:
     - `app/`: Main binaries for Firedancer and Frankendancer, including development versions and shared utilities.
     - `ballet/`: Implements standards for interoperability with the Solana ecosystem.
     - `choreo/`: Contains consensus components like fork choice and voting.
     - `disco/` and `discof/`: Include network stack, block production, consensus, runtime, and RPC components.
     - `discoh/`: Frankendancer tiles with Agave FFI.
     - `flamenco/`: Solana SVM and runtime.
     - `funk/` and `groove/`: Key-value stores for accounts DB, with `funk/` being in-memory and `groove/` being disk-backed.
     - `tango/`: IPC messaging layer.
     - `util/`: Provides C language environment, system runtime, and utilities.
     - `waltz/`: Networking components.
     - `wiredancer/`: FPGA modules.

6. **Important Files**:
   - `README.md`: Provides an overview and instructions for the project.
   - `deps.sh`: Prepares external dependencies.
   - Test launchers: Scripts for running unit, script, and integration tests, as well as a comprehensive CI test launcher.
   - `NOTICE`: Contains licensing information for imported third-party code.

This structure provides a comprehensive organization of the Firedancer project, facilitating development, testing, and integration with external systems.
