Quickstart guide for running CodeQL queries on the Firedancer repository using a GitHub-hosted database.

# Purpose
The quickstart guide provides instructions to run CodeQL queries against the GitHub-hosted CodeQL database for the Firedancer repository. The database updates nightly, so it does not immediately reflect source code changes. The guide specifies that the process should be executed locally and not through remote environments like VSCode Remote SSH. It lists the requirements, including a Visual Studio Code installation and access to the `firedancer-io` organization. The steps include downloading the CodeQL bundle, installing `codeql` to the system path, optionally fixing CA certificates if behind a corporate proxy, and setting up the VSCode environment to recognize `codeql`. Users must install the `vscode-codeql` extension, download the Firedancer CodeQL database, and add it to the workspace. Additionally, the guide provides an alternative method to create a CodeQL database from scratch, which requires re-creation whenever the source code changes.
