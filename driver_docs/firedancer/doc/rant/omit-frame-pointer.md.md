Discussion on the historical and current relevance of the `-fomit-frame-pointer` compile flag.

# Purpose
The metadata content provides historical and technical context for the `-fomit-frame-pointer` compile flag, particularly in relation to its use on x86 and x86_64 architectures. The flag was originally used to optimize performance by freeing up an additional register in the register-limited x86 architecture, which improved real-world performance by reducing the need for stack spills. However, this optimization came at the cost of making debugging more difficult, as it complicated stack inspection. Over time, improvements in debugging tools and the introduction of x86_64 with a larger register file have reduced both the benefits and drawbacks of using this flag. The content suggests that the utility of `-fomit-frame-pointer` is now more context-dependent, varying with different architectures and operating systems, and is not considered essential for modern Linux/x86_64 systems.
