Specifies files and directories to ignore in the `firedancer` codebase for version control.

# Purpose
The content specifies a `.gitignore` file used in a software project to exclude certain files and directories from being tracked by Git version control. It lists various patterns and specific files that should not be included in the repository, such as build directories (`/build`, `bin`, `tmp`), temporary files (`*.swp`, `*.swo`), and configuration files for different development environments and tools (e.g., `.vscode`, `.idea`, `compile_commands.json`). It also excludes files related to specific programming languages and tools, such as Rust's `Cargo.lock`, Python's `*.pyc`, and packet capture files (`*.pcap`, `*.pcapng`). Additionally, it includes entries for logs (`*.log`), test and deployment scripts (`*.sh`), and other environment-specific files, ensuring that only relevant source code and necessary files are committed to the repository.
