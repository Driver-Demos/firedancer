Documentation for Firedancer, a new validator client for Solana, including setup and development instructions.

# Purpose
The document provides an overview of the Firedancer project, a validator client for the Solana blockchain. Firedancer is designed to be fast, secure, and independent, offering client diversity to the Solana network. The document outlines the project's components, including two validators: Frankendancer, which combines Firedancer and Agave components, and Firedancer, a full implementation from scratch. It provides guidance for operators and developers, including links to documentation and release guides. The document also includes instructions for setting up a development environment on Linux, detailing the steps to clone the repository, install dependencies, and run the validator. Additionally, it mentions the licensing under the Apache 2 license and references to external libraries with various licenses.
# Content Summary
The provided content describes the Firedancer project, a new validator client for the Solana blockchain. Firedancer is designed to be fast, secure, and independent, drawing on low latency trading experience and featuring high-performance reimplementations of Solana primitives. It operates in a restrictive sandbox environment with minimal system calls and is developed from scratch to enhance client diversity and resilience against supply chain attacks.

The project includes two validators: Frankendancer and Firedancer. Frankendancer is a hybrid validator that combines components from Firedancer and Agave, using Firedancer's networking stack and block production for improved performance. It is available on Solana's testnet and mainnet-beta. The full Firedancer validator, built entirely from scratch, is not yet ready for test or production use.

For developers, Firedancer supports Linux with a minimum kernel version of 4.18. The development process involves cloning the repository, setting up dependencies, and using `make` to run the validator. The `fddev dev` command configures the system, creates necessary blockchain components, and starts a local validator. It requires `sudo` for privileged system changes. Developers can join a development cluster by configuring `[rpc.entrypoints]` in the configuration file.

Firedancer is licensed under the Apache 2 license, with some external libraries under different licenses. The full license text is available in the LICENSE file.
