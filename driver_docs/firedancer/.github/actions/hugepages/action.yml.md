GitHub Action to set up 1 GiB gigantic pages with configurable huge and gigantic page counts.

# Purpose
The configuration file defines a setup process for managing huge pages and gigantic pages in a system. It specifies two inputs: `count_huge` and `count_gigantic`, which represent the number of huge pages and gigantic pages, respectively. Both inputs are required and have default values of '160' for huge pages and '64' for gigantic pages. The file uses a composite run strategy with a series of bash shell commands to configure shared memory. These commands include unmounting existing huge page file systems, resetting and initializing shared memory configurations, and allocating the specified number of huge and gigantic pages if the current number is less than the desired count. The script also changes the ownership of the `/mnt/.fd` directory to the current user.
