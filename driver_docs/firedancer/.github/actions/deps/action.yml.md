GitHub Action for building and caching dependencies with configurable scripts and compiler options.

# Purpose
The configuration file defines a workflow for building and caching software dependencies. It specifies inputs such as the paths to the `deps.sh` and `deps-bundle.sh` scripts, extra flags, and the compiler and its version to use. The workflow checks if the `apt-get` package manager is available and updates the package list if it is. It calculates a hash for the `deps.sh` script and uses it to manage a local cache of dependencies, optimizing the build process by reusing cached dependencies when possible. If the cache is not available, the workflow installs system-level dependencies and compiles the necessary components from scratch, using the specified compiler and version.
