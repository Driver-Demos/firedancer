Configuration for Dependabot to update GitHub Actions weekly and npm packages daily.

# Purpose
The file configures automated updates for dependencies in a project. It specifies two update schedules: one for the `github-actions` package ecosystem, set to update weekly, and another for the `npm` package ecosystem, set to update daily. The `directory` field indicates the location within the project where each package ecosystem is managed.
