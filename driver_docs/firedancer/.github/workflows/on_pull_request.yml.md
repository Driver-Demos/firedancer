GitHub Actions workflow for handling pull request events with jobs for testing, backtesting, benchmarking, and build checks.

# Purpose
This GitHub Actions workflow configuration file automates processes triggered by pull request events. It specifies that the workflow should activate on pull request events such as `synchronize`, `opened`, `reopened`, and `ready_for_review`. The `concurrency` section ensures that only one workflow runs per pull request, canceling any in-progress runs if a new one starts. The `permissions` section grants read access to contents and write access to issues and pull requests. The `jobs` section defines multiple jobs, including `tests`, `backtest`, `benchmark`, and two `build_checks`, each conditioned to run only if the pull request is not a draft. These jobs use predefined workflows and inherit secrets, with specific configurations for build checks, such as compiler and machine exceptions.
