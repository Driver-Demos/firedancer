GitHub Actions workflow to check for trailing whitespace in pull request changes.

# Purpose
This GitHub Actions workflow is designed to check for trailing whitespace in files that are part of a pull request. It triggers on the `pull_request` event and runs a job named `trailing-whitespace` on the `ubuntu-latest` environment. The workflow first checks out the repository using `actions/checkout@v5` with a full fetch depth. It then identifies the files that have changed in the pull request, excluding those in the `src/disco/gui/dist*` directory, and stores the list in the `GITHUB_OUTPUT`. The workflow sets up a Python environment using `actions/setup-python@v6` and finally runs the `pre-commit` action with the specified files to check for trailing whitespace issues.
