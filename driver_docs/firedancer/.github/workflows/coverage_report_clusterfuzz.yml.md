GitHub Actions workflow for generating and uploading a daily coverage report using the ClusterFuzz corpus.

# Purpose
The configuration file defines a GitHub Actions workflow named `Coverage Report (ClusterFuzz)`. This workflow generates a coverage report using the ClusterFuzz corpus, which is a set of test cases that ClusterFuzz has identified. The workflow is triggered by a `workflow_call` event and runs on the `ubuntu-latest` environment. It sets up the environment with specific machine and tool configurations, checks out the repository, and authenticates with Google Cloud using credentials stored in a secret. The workflow builds the project, replaces the corpus directory with data from ClusterFuzz, and generates a fuzz coverage report. Finally, it uploads the coverage report to CodeCov, using a token stored in a secret, to facilitate code coverage analysis.
