GitHub Actions workflow for nightly builds, coverage reports, and CodeQL analysis.

# Purpose
This YAML configuration file defines a GitHub Actions workflow named `On Nightly`. The workflow is triggered manually via `workflow_dispatch` or automatically on a schedule set by the cron expression `0 4 * * *`, which runs the workflow daily at 4:00 AM UTC. The workflow includes several jobs: `coverage-report`, `codeql`, and multiple build jobs (`builds_1`, `builds_2`, `builds_3`, `builds_4`). Each job uses a specific workflow file located in the `.github/workflows` directory. The `coverage-report` and `codeql` jobs focus on generating coverage reports and performing code quality analysis, respectively. The build jobs execute different build configurations, specifying parameters such as `machine`, `build_arm`, `clang`, and `cid`, with exceptions for certain compiler and machine combinations.
