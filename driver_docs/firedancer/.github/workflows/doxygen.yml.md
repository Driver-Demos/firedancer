GitHub Actions workflow for running Doxygen documentation generation and uploading artifacts to Google Cloud.

# Purpose
This GitHub Actions workflow file automates the generation and upload of Doxygen documentation. It is scheduled to run daily at 3 AM using a cron expression and can also be triggered manually via `workflow_dispatch`. The workflow defines a job named `doxygen` that runs on a specified runner with the label `rocky810` and group `fd-public-repo`. The job installs necessary dependencies such as `clang-devel`, `llvm-devel`, and `graphviz` using the `dnf` package manager, and then executes a build script located at `contrib/doxygen/build.sh`. After building the documentation, the workflow authenticates to Google Cloud using a service account and uploads the generated HTML files to a specified Google Cloud Storage bucket.
