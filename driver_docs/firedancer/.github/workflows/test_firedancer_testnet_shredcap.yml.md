GitHub Actions workflow for testing the Firedancer Testnet Shredcap with specific environment setups.

# Purpose
The YAML configuration file defines a GitHub Actions workflow named `Firedancer Testnet Shredcap`. This workflow can be triggered manually (`workflow_dispatch`) or called by another workflow (`workflow_call`). It accepts an input parameter `machine` with a default value of `linux_gcc_zen2`. The workflow contains a single job, `firedancer-testnet-shredcap`, which runs on a self-hosted runner with specific labels and a timeout of 30 minutes. The job sets up the environment with specific variables, checks out the repository, and executes several steps including dependency setup, building the project, setting up the Agave repository, running a replay test, and cleaning up resources. The cleanup step ensures that all temporary files and processes related to the testnet are removed, maintaining a clean state for subsequent runs.
