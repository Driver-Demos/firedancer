GitHub Actions workflow for nightly CodeQL analysis on C/C++ code using a matrix strategy.

# Purpose
The YAML configuration file defines a GitHub Actions workflow named `CodeQL Nightly Analysis`. This workflow is triggered manually or by other workflows using `workflow_call` and `workflow_dispatch`. It sets permissions to write security events and defines a job named `analyze` that runs on a specified runner group. The job uses a matrix strategy to perform analysis on different programming languages, specifically C and C++, with specified compilers and build configurations. The workflow includes steps to check out the repository, set up dependencies, initialize the CodeQL tool, and perform a CodeQL analysis. The analysis results are uploaded with a category based on the language being analyzed.
