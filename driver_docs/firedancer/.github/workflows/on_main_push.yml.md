GitHub Actions workflow for triggering jobs on main branch push, including book, clusterfuzz, and solfuzz CI.

# Purpose
The YAML configuration file defines a GitHub Actions workflow that triggers on pushes to the `main` branch. It specifies three jobs: `book`, `clusterfuzz`, and `trigger`. The `book` job uses a workflow defined in `book.yml`, inherits secrets, and has permissions to read contents and write to pages and id-token. The `clusterfuzz` job uses a workflow defined in `clusterfuzz.yml` and also inherits secrets. The `trigger` job depends on the completion of the `clusterfuzz` job, runs on the latest Ubuntu environment, and includes a step to dispatch a custom event to the `solfuzz` repository using a POST request to the GitHub API, authenticated with a personal access token.
