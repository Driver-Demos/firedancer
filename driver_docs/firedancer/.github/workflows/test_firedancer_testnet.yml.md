GitHub Actions workflow for running and testing the Firedancer Testnet with specific environment settings.

# Purpose
The YAML configuration file defines a GitHub Actions workflow named `Firedancer Testnet`. It triggers on `workflow_call` and `workflow_dispatch` events, allowing manual and programmatic execution. The `concurrency` section ensures that only one instance of the workflow runs per pull request or branch, canceling any in-progress runs if a new one starts. The `firedancer-testnet` job runs on a self-hosted runner with specific labels and environment variables, such as `CC` set to `gcc`. The job includes several steps: checking out the repository with submodules, executing custom actions for dependencies, CPU configuration, and huge page allocation, followed by building the project and running tests for the Firedancer testnet.
