GitHub Actions workflow for generating and uploading a coverage report to Google Cloud Storage.

# Purpose
The configuration file defines a GitHub Actions workflow named `Coverage Report`. This workflow is triggered manually or by other workflows and is designed to generate a coverage report for the codebase. It includes unit tests, script tests, and fuzz tests, and is intended to run only on trusted code, such as commits merged to the main branch. The workflow runs on a specified environment with a timeout of 60 minutes and involves several steps, including checking out the code, setting up dependencies, configuring the environment, generating coverage data, and uploading the results to Google Cloud Storage and CodeCov. The workflow uses specific GitHub Actions and tools, such as `actions/checkout`, `google-github-actions/auth`, and `codecov/codecov-action`, to perform these tasks.
