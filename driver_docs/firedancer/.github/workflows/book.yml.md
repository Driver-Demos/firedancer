GitHub Actions workflow for deploying a VitePress book site to GitHub Pages.

# Purpose
This configuration file defines a GitHub Actions workflow for deploying a VitePress book site to GitHub Pages. The workflow can be triggered manually from the Actions tab using `workflow_dispatch`. It sets permissions for the `GITHUB_TOKEN` to allow reading contents and writing to GitHub Pages. The workflow ensures only one deployment runs at a time by using the `concurrency` setting, which prevents cancellation of in-progress runs. The workflow consists of two main jobs: `build` and `deploy`. The `build` job checks out the repository, sets up the environment, installs dependencies, builds the site with VitePress, and uploads the build artifact. The `deploy` job, which depends on the completion of the `build` job, deploys the site to GitHub Pages.
