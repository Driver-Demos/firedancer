GitHub Actions workflow for replaying ledgers with configurable inputs and environment setup.

# Purpose
The YAML configuration file defines a GitHub Actions workflow named `Replay Ledgers`. This workflow can be triggered by a `workflow_call` or `workflow_dispatch` event. It accepts inputs such as `coverage`, `machine`, and `extras`, with default values set for each. The workflow includes a job named `backtest-ledger-replay`, which has a timeout of 15 minutes and runs on a self-hosted runner with specific labels and group settings. The job sets environment variables and executes a series of steps, including cleanup, checking out the repository, setting up dependencies, configuring hugepages, building the project, finding the `OBJDIR`, testing replay ledgers, and final cleanup. The steps involve running shell commands to manage processes, build the project, and execute tests related to ledger replay.
