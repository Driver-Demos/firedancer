Configuration for Codecov coverage settings, disabling project and patch status, with specific flags.

# Purpose
The configuration file manages code coverage settings. It disables project and patch coverage status checks by setting `project` and `patch` to `off`. The `comment` option is set to `false`, indicating that comments are not added. The `flags` section includes `clusterfuzz` and `ledgers`, both with `carryforward` set to `true`, which indicates that coverage data for these flags is carried forward, with `clusterfuzz` specifically noted for nightly reporting.
