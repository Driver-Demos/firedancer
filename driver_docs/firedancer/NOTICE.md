Legal notices and licensing information for various third-party software components used in the Firedancer codebase.

# Purpose
This document provides legal notices and licensing information for various third-party software components integrated into the codebase. It details the origins, modifications, and licensing terms of several cryptographic and utility libraries, such as `xxHash`, `MurmurHash3`, `OpenSSL`, and others. The document specifies the licenses under which these components are used, including BSD, Apache, MIT, and public domain licenses, among others. It also includes references to the original source code repositories and the specific versions or commits from which the code was derived. This information is crucial for ensuring compliance with open-source licenses and for acknowledging the contributions of original authors and projects.
# Content Summary
This document provides a detailed overview of various cryptographic and utility implementations used within a software codebase, along with their licensing information. It includes references to external libraries and algorithms that have been integrated or modified for use in the project.

1. **Hashing Algorithms**: The document describes the use of modified versions of the xxHash and MurmurHash3 algorithms. The `fd_hash` and `fd_hash_memcpy` functions are based on xxHash(r39), while `fd_funk_rec_key_hash` uses a modified xxHash3. The `fd_uint_hash` and `fd_ulong_hash` functions are derived from MurmurHash3's fmix32 and fmix64 functions.

2. **Cryptographic Implementations**: 
   - The SHA-512 implementation is a modified version of OpenSSL's SHA-512, with assembly code generated from OpenSSL's AVX2 code generator.
   - The Ed25519 and X25519 implementations are optimized versions based on OpenSSL and the Go standard library, respectively.
   - AES implementations, including AES-ECB and AES-GCM, are adapted from OpenSSL sources, with some parts autogenerated from OpenSSL's assembly code generators.
   - A high-performance AES-GCM implementation for x86 is adapted from Linux kernel submissions by Eric Biggers.

3. **Other Cryptographic Functions**:
   - The ChaCha20 stream cipher is implemented based on Daniel J. Bernstein's design.
   - The BLAKE3 compression function is derived from the BLAKE3 project.
   - The SipHash implementation is based on the work of Jean-Philippe Aumasson and Daniel J. Bernstein.

4. **Utility Libraries**:
   - The Nanopb library is used for protocol buffers, and the PicoHTTPParser library is used for HTTP parsing.
   - The cJSON library is included for JSON parsing.
   - A UTF-8 validator is derived from the Rust standard library.
   - The `src/ballet/fiat-crypto` directory contains code generated using Fiat-Crypto.

5. **Licensing**: The document provides detailed licensing information for each component, including BSD, Apache, MIT, and public domain licenses. It specifies the conditions under which the software can be used, modified, and distributed.

6. **Test Vectors and Additional Components**:
   - Test vectors for SHA-2 and AES are sourced from the NIST Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Program.
   - The `src/waltz/resolv` directory contains modified network code from musl.
   - The `fd_h2` library includes a modified HPACK Huffman decoder from nghttp2.
   - Compiled SBPF programs for testing are sourced from Anza's Agave and Token programs.

This document is essential for developers to understand the origins, modifications, and licensing of the cryptographic and utility components used in the software. It ensures compliance with licensing terms and provides a basis for further development and integration.
