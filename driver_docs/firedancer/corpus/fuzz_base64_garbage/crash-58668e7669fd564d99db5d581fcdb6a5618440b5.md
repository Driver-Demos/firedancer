Binary data file for fuzz testing base64 decoding in the `firedancer` codebase.

# Purpose
The letter `J` in a metadata or configuration file may serve as a placeholder or a specific identifier within the software codebase. It could represent a key, a value, or a symbolic reference used in the context of the software's configuration or metadata management. The exact purpose depends on the broader context in which it is used within the software system.
