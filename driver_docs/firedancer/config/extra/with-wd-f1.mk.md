Configuration file for AWS-F1 with include paths, preprocessor flags, and linker flags.

# Purpose
This Makefile snippet configures the build environment for a project using AWS F1 instances. It sets include paths for the compiler with `INCLUDES`, pointing to directories within the SDK and HDK. The `CPPFLAGS` variable defines preprocessor flags, setting a log level and enabling a feature called `WIREDANCER`. The `LDFLAGS` variable specifies the library path and links against the `fpga_mgmt` library.
