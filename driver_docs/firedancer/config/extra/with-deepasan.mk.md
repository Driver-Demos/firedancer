Configuration for enabling AddressSanitizer and LeakSanitizer in the build process.

# Purpose
The file configures the build environment to enable AddressSanitizer (ASAN) and Deep AddressSanitizer (DEEPASAN) for the project. It sets the `FD_HAS_ASAN` and `FD_HAS_DEEPASAN` flags to `1`, indicating that these sanitizers are active. The `CPPFLAGS` and `CFLAGS` are updated to include the `-DFD_HAS_ASAN=1` and `-DFD_HAS_DEEPASAN=1` definitions, while `CPPFLAGS` and `LDFLAGS` are appended with `-fsanitize=address,leak` and `-fno-omit-frame-pointer` to ensure that the address and leak sanitization features are applied during compilation and linking.
