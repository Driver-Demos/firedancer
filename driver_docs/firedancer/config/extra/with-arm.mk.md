Makefile for cross-compiling with Arm architecture support, setting flags and toolchain options.

# Purpose
This Makefile script is used to configure the build process for a software project, specifically addressing cross-compilation for Arm architectures. It checks the machine architecture using `uname -m` and sets the `CROSS` variable to 1 if the architecture is neither `aarch64` nor `arm64`, indicating a cross-compilation scenario. When cross-compiling, it adjusts the compiler and linker flags, setting `CPPFLAGS` and `LDFLAGS` appropriately, and defines the target architecture with the `TARGET` variable. The script also includes conditional logic to configure the compiler settings based on whether GCC or Clang is used, appending necessary flags. If cross-compilation is not required, it includes additional configuration files for various libraries and features. The script sets `FD_ARCH_SUPPORTS_SANDBOX` and `FD_HAS_ARM` to indicate support for Arm architecture and sandboxing.
