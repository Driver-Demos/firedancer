Makefile settings for enabling or disabling optimization flags in C++ and Rust builds.

# Purpose
This Makefile configuration controls the optimization settings for compiling C++ code. If the `FD_DISABLE_OPTIMIZATION` variable is not set, the `CPPFLAGS` are configured to include optimization flags `-O3`, `-ffast-math`, `-fno-associative-math`, and `-fno-reciprocal-math`, and defines `FD_HAS_OPTIMIZATION` as 1. If `FD_DISABLE_OPTIMIZATION` is set, the optimization level is set to `-O0` while retaining the same math flags. Additionally, the `RUST_PROFILE` is set to `release-with-debug`, indicating the Rust build profile to use.
