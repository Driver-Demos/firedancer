Allows replacement of the default C++ standard library with libc++ for MSan builds.

# Purpose
The configuration file allows the user to replace the default C++ standard library with `libc++`, which is useful for building with MemorySanitizer (MSan). It checks if the `LIBCXX` environment variable is set, and if not, it produces an error. The file modifies the `CXXFLAGS` to exclude the default C++ standard library and include the headers from the `libc++` library. Additionally, it updates the `LDFLAGS` to link against the `libc++` and `libc++abi` libraries. This setup ensures that the build process uses the specified `libc++` libraries instead of the default ones.
