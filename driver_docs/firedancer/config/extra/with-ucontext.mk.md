Makefile configuration to use `libucontext` if available, setting flags for `ucontext` support.

# Purpose
This Makefile snippet checks for the presence of the `libucontext` library and adjusts the build flags accordingly. If the file `/lib/libucontext.a` exists, it appends `-lucontext` to the `LDFLAGS`, indicating that the linker should use the `libucontext` library. Additionally, it sets the `FD_HAS_UCONTEXT` variable to `1` and adds `-DFD_HAS_UCONTEXT=1` to `CPPFLAGS`, which defines the `FD_HAS_UCONTEXT` macro during compilation. This configuration ensures compatibility with systems where `ucontext.h` is not part of the standard library, such as musl libc.
