Makefile configuration for offline replay and usage tracking in the Firedancer project.

# Purpose
The file includes the `config/extra/with-handholding.mk` makefile, which likely contains additional build configurations. It appends the `CPPFLAGS` and `CFLAGS` variables with the preprocessor definitions `-DFD_SPAD_TRACK_USAGE=1` and `-DFD_OFFLINE_REPLAY=1`. These definitions enable specific features or modes in the software, such as tracking usage and offline replay functionality, during the compilation process.
