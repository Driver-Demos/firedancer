Makefile configuration for enabling thread and atomic support with specific compiler and linker flags.

# Purpose
The file includes additional makefile configurations from `config/extra/with-hosted.mk`. It appends the `-pthread`, `-DFD_HAS_THREADS=1`, and `-DFD_HAS_ATOMIC=1` flags to `CPPFLAGS`, and appends `-pthread` to `LDFLAGS`, indicating the use of POSIX threads and enabling thread and atomic operation support. The variables `FD_HAS_THREADS` and `FD_HAS_ATOMIC` are set to `1`, confirming that the build process should support threading and atomic operations.
