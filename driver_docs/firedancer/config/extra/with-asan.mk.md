Configuration for enabling AddressSanitizer (ASAN) with specific compiler flags and options.

# Purpose
The configuration file sets up compiler and linker flags to enable AddressSanitizer (ASan) for detecting memory errors such as buffer overflows and memory leaks. The `FD_HAS_ASAN` variable is defined and added to `CPPFLAGS` to indicate that ASan is active. The `CPPFLAGS` and `LDFLAGS` are appended with `-fsanitize=address,leak` to enable address and leak sanitization during compilation and linking. If the `FD_USING_GCC` flag is set, additional compiler flags are added to suppress specific warnings and disable stack protection, which can cause issues when using ASan with GCC. These settings help in identifying and debugging memory-related errors during the development process.
