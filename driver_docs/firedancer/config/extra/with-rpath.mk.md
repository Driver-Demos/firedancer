Makefile for linking libraries with rpath using LDFLAGS.

# Purpose
The `LDFLAGS` variable in this configuration file is used to specify linker flags for compiling a program. It appends the `-Wl,-rpath,${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}` option, which instructs the linker to set the runtime library search path (`rpath`) to the directories specified in the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable. This ensures that the linked libraries are found at runtime.
