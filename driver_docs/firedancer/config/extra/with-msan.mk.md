Makefile configuration for enabling MemorySanitizer with optional origin tracking.

# Purpose
The file configures the build system to enable memory sanitization using the MemorySanitizer tool. It sets the `FD_HAS_MSAN` flag to `1` and adds the `-DFD_HAS_MSAN=1` definition to `CPPFLAGS`. It also appends the `-fsanitize=memory` option to both `CPPFLAGS` and `LDFLAGS` to enable memory error detection during compilation and linking. The file includes additional configuration from `config/extra/with-libcxx.mk`. The `-fsanitize-memory-track-origins` option is present but commented out, indicating it is not currently active.
