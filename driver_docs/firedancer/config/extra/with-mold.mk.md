Configures the linker to use 'mold' for faster linking of large binaries.

# Purpose
The file configures the build process to use the `mold` linker, which is known for its speed with large binaries. It sets the `MOLD_LDFLAGS` variable to `-fuse-ld=mold` by default. If the `FD_USING_GCC` flag is set and the GCC version is older than 12, it adjusts `MOLD_LDFLAGS` to use the path to `mold` directly with `-B$(shell which mold)`. Finally, it appends the `MOLD_LDFLAGS` to the `LDFLAGS` variable, ensuring that the build process uses the specified linker flags.
