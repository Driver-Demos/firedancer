Makefile settings to enable debug information and dynamic linking.

# Purpose
The file configures compilation and linking flags for a C++ project. The `CPPFLAGS` variable is set to include the `-g3` flag, which adds debugging information, and the `-fno-omit-frame-pointer` flag, which preserves the frame pointer for better debugging. The `LDFLAGS` variable includes the `-rdynamic` flag, which makes all symbols in the executable available to the dynamic linker, aiding in debugging and profiling.
