Makefile configuration for compiler warning flags with specific settings for Clang and GCC.

# Purpose
The content configures compiler flags for building a C or C++ project. The `CPPFLAGS` variable is used to specify preprocessor options that enforce strict code quality checks. These include flags such as `-Werror`, which treats all warnings as errors, and `-Wall`, `-Wextra`, and `-Wpedantic`, which enable various levels of warning messages. The configuration also includes conditional sections for different compilers. If `FD_USING_CLANG` is defined, additional flags specific to the Clang compiler are added, such as `-Wimplicit-fallthrough` and several flags to suppress specific warnings. Similarly, if `FD_USING_GCC` is defined, flags specific to the GCC compiler are appended, including `-Wimplicit-fallthrough=2` and `-Wstrict-prototypes`. These conditional flags ensure that the code is compiled with appropriate warnings and error checks depending on the compiler used.
