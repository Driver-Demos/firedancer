Makefile configuration for x86-64 architecture with compiler-specific flags and additional includes.

# Purpose
The `Makefile` content configures compilation flags and includes additional configuration files for a software project. The `CPPFLAGS` variable is used to specify compiler options, such as `-mfpmath=sse` and `-falign-functions=32`, which optimize floating-point math and function alignment. Conditional statements check for specific compilers, such as GCC and Clang, to apply additional flags like `-mbranch-cost=5` for GCC and `-Xclang -target-feature -Xclang +fast-vector-fsqrt` for Clang. The file also includes several other configuration files from the `config/extra` directory, which likely provide additional settings or dependencies for the build process. The variable `FD_ARCH_SUPPORTS_SANDBOX` is set to `1`, indicating that the architecture supports sandboxing features.
