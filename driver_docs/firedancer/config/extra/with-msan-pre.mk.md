Makefile configuration for compiling dependencies with MemorySanitizer using -fsanitize=memory.

# Purpose
The file configures the use of MemorySanitizer by specifying that all dependencies must be recompiled with the `-fsanitize=memory` flag. It instructs to run the `./deps.sh +msan` command to create an optimized build named `opt-msan`. The `OPT` and `LIBCXX` variables are set to `opt-msan`, indicating that this build configuration should be used for both optimization and the C++ standard library.
