Makefile configuration for integrating AFL++ fuzzing with specific compiler and linker flags.

# Purpose
The `Makefile` content configures the build process for a software project with fuzzing capabilities. It sets the `FD_HAS_FUZZ` variable to enable fuzzing features. The script checks if the `AFL_LIB` environment variable is set, which should point to the AFL (American Fuzzy Lop) installation directory, and raises an error if it is not. The `CPPFLAGS` are configured to include options for frame pointer omission and fuzzing sanitization, while `LDFLAGS` and `LDFLAGS_FUZZ` are set to include specific sanitization coverage and link against AFL's runtime libraries.
