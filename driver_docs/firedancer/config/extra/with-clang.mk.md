Configuration for building with Clang, including workarounds for strict build issues and library linking.

# Purpose
The provided Makefile configuration sets up the build environment to use the `clang` compiler for C and C++ code by defining `CC`, `CXX`, and `LD` as `clang`, `clang++`, and `clang++`, respectively. It includes specific flags and definitions to address limitations and differences between `clang` and `gcc`, such as disabling certain strict checks that `clang` enforces, which can interfere with real-world packet parsing. The `CPPFLAGS` variable is updated to define `FD_USING_CLANG=1`, which allows other parts of the build system to adjust their behavior based on the use of `clang`. Additionally, the `LDFLAGS` variable is modified to include the `-lstdc++` library, ensuring that necessary C++ standard libraries are linked when using `clang++`. These configurations ensure compatibility and functionality when building the software with `clang`.
