Makefile for a fully static build, not compatible with glibc.

# Purpose
The file configures the build process to create a fully static build by appending the `-static` flag to the `LDFLAGS` variable. This ensures that the linker includes all necessary libraries directly into the executable, making it independent of shared libraries. Note that this configuration is not compatible with the GNU C Library (glibc).
