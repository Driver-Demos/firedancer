Makefile configuration for setting compiler and linker flags with platform-specific options.

# Purpose
The `Makefile` content sets compilation and linking flags for building a software project. The `CPPFLAGS` variable includes preprocessor definitions such as `_XOPEN_SOURCE=700` and `FD_HAS_HOSTED=1`, which control feature test macros and indicate a hosted environment. The `LDFLAGS` variable specifies linker options, including `-z noexecstack` to prevent executable stacks and `-lrt` to link with the real-time library. The `FD_HAS_HOSTED` variable is set to `1`, indicating a hosted environment. The script checks the operating system using the `uname` command, and if it is Linux, it sets the `FD_HAS_LINUX` variable to `1`.
