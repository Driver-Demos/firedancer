Checks for the presence of `s2n-bignum` library and sets compilation flags accordingly.

# Purpose
The `Makefile` snippet checks for the existence of the `libs2nbignum.a` library in the specified `$(OPT)/lib` directory. If the library is present, it sets the `FD_HAS_S2NBIGNUM` variable to 1 and appends the `-DFD_HAS_S2NBIGNUM=1` flag to `CFLAGS` and the library path to `LDFLAGS`. If the library is not found, it issues a warning message indicating that `s2n-bignum` is not installed and will be skipped.
