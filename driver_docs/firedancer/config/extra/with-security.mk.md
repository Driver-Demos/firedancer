Makefile settings for security flags in C/C++ compilation and linking.

# Purpose
The file configures compiler and linker flags for building a software project. The `CPPFLAGS` variable includes flags for position-independent code (`-fPIC`), stack protection (`-fstack-protector-strong`), and linker options for read-only relocations and immediate binding (`-Wl,-z,relro,-z,now`). The `LDFLAGS_EXE` and `LDFLAGS_SO` variables specify flags for position-independent executables (`-pie`) and shared objects (`-fPIC`), respectively. Additionally, the `_FORTIFY_SOURCE` macro is conditionally defined in `CPPFLAGS` to enhance security, but only when optimization is enabled, as indicated by the absence of the `FD_DISABLE_OPTIMIZATION` variable.
