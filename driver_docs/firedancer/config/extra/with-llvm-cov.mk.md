Makefile configuration for enabling LLVM coverage with Clang in the Firedancer project.

# Purpose
The `Makefile` snippet configures code coverage settings based on the use of the Clang compiler. If the `FD_USING_CLANG` variable is set to "1", it enables coverage by setting `FD_HAS_COVERAGE` to "1" and appends specific flags to `CPPFLAGS` and `LDFLAGS` to generate profiling information and coverage mapping. If Clang is not used, it issues a warning indicating that `llvm-cov` is requested but Clang is not being used.
