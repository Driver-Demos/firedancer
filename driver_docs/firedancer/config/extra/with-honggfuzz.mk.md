Makefile settings for using honggfuzz with specific compiler and linker options.

# Purpose
The Makefile configuration sets the C compiler to `hfuzz-clang` and the C++ compiler and linker to `hfuzz-clang++`. It adds the `-fno-omit-frame-pointer` flag to the preprocessor options, which ensures that the frame pointer is not omitted during compilation. The variable `FD_HAS_FUZZ` is set to `1`, indicating that fuzzing capabilities are enabled.
