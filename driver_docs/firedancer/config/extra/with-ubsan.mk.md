Configures UBSan with various sanitizers for undefined behavior detection in the build process.

# Purpose
The configuration file sets compiler flags to enable various undefined behavior sanitizers during the build process. The `FD_HAS_UBSAN` and `FD_UNALIGNED_ACCESS_STYLE` variables are defined and added to `CPPFLAGS` to indicate the presence of undefined behavior sanitization and specify the unaligned access style, respectively. The `LDFLAGS` and `CPPFLAGS` are appended with `-fsanitize=undefined` and other specific sanitizers to detect issues such as shift errors, integer division by zero, unreachable code, and various other potential runtime errors. These flags help identify and prevent undefined behavior in the code by enabling runtime checks for a wide range of error conditions.
