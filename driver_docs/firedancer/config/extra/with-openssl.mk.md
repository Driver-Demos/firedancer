Makefile configuration for OpenSSL library detection and setup.

# Purpose
The `Makefile` snippet checks for the presence of the OpenSSL static library `libssl.a` in a specified directory `$(OPT)/lib`. If the library exists, it sets the `OPENSSL_LIBS` variable to include both `libssl.a` and `libcrypto.a`. It also defines the `FD_HAS_OPENSSL` variable as `1` and appends preprocessor flags to `CPPFLAGS` to indicate OpenSSL compatibility and to disable deprecated features. If the library is not found, it outputs a message indicating that OpenSSL is not installed and skips related configurations.
