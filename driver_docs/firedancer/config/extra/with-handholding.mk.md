Defines preprocessor flags to enable "handholding" features in various components.

# Purpose
The configuration file sets preprocessor flags for a C or C++ build system. Each line adds a definition to the `CPPFLAGS` variable, which is used during the compilation process. The flags define macros such as `FD_EQVOC_USE_HANDHOLDING`, `FD_GHOST_USE_HANDHOLDING`, and others, indicating that the "handholding" feature is enabled for various components of the software. This setup allows the compiler to conditionally include or exclude code sections based on these macro definitions, facilitating feature toggling or debugging.
