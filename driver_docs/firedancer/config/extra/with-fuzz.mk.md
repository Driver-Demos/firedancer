Makefile settings for fuzz testing with specific compiler and linker flags.

# Purpose
The Makefile includes additional configuration from `config/extra/with-handholding.mk` and sets the `FD_HAS_FUZZ` variable to `1`, indicating that fuzzing is enabled. It modifies the `CPPFLAGS` to include flags for frame pointer omission and fuzzing sanitization, specifically `-fno-omit-frame-pointer`, `-fsanitize=fuzzer-no-link`, and `-fsanitize-coverage=inline-8bit-counters`. The `LDFLAGS` are also adjusted to include `-fsanitize-coverage=inline-8bit-counters`, and `LDFLAGS_FUZZ` is set to `-fsanitize=fuzzer`, configuring the build process for fuzz testing.
