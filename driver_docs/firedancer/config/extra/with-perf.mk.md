Makefile configuration to add compiler flags for performance profiling.

# Purpose
The `CPPFLAGS` variable in this configuration file adds the compiler flags `-fno-omit-frame-pointer` and `-fno-inline`. The `-fno-omit-frame-pointer` flag instructs the compiler to keep the frame pointer in the generated code, which can be useful for debugging and profiling. The `-fno-inline` flag prevents the compiler from inlining functions, which can also aid in debugging by preserving function call boundaries.
