Makefile for building, testing, and cleaning various components, including binaries, libraries, and tests.

# Purpose
This Makefile is used to automate the build process of a software project. It defines various rules and targets to compile source code, run tests, and manage dependencies. The file includes settings to disable built-in rules and variables, and it specifies a list of phony targets such as `all`, `info`, `check`, `bin`, `rust`, `include`, `lib`, `unit-test`, `integration-test`, `fuzz-test`, `help`, `clean`, and `distclean`. The Makefile sets up directories for object files and includes rules for compiling C and C++ source files into object files, generating dependency files, and creating static libraries. It also defines targets for running unit tests, integration tests, and fuzz tests, as well as generating coverage reports using LLVM tools. Additionally, the Makefile includes rules for managing frontend builds using npm and for cleaning up build artifacts. The use of variables and conditional statements allows for flexible configuration and customization of the build process.
# Content Summary
This Makefile is a configuration file used to automate the build process of a software project. It defines various rules and targets to manage the compilation, testing, and cleaning of the project. Here are the key functional details:

1. **Flags and Options**: 
   - `MAKEFLAGS` is set to disable built-in rules and variables, ensuring that only the rules defined in this Makefile are used.
   - `CPPFLAGS` and `EXTRA_CPPFLAGS` are used to define preprocessor flags, including build information.

2. **Directory Structure**:
   - `OBJDIR` is defined as the output directory for build artifacts, derived from `BASEDIR` and `BUILDDIR`.
   - `LOCAL_MKS` is a variable that stores paths to `Local.mk` files found in the source tree, allowing for modular inclusion of additional make rules.

3. **Phony Targets**:
   - `.PHONY` is used to declare targets that do not correspond to actual files, such as `all`, `clean`, `distclean`, `help`, and various test targets.

4. **Build Targets**:
   - `all`: Builds the main components of the project, including binaries, libraries, and tests.
   - `bin`, `include`, `lib`: Targets for building binaries, include files, and libraries, respectively.
   - `unit-test`, `integration-test`, `fuzz-test`: Targets for building and running different types of tests.

5. **Test Execution**:
   - `run-unit-test` and `run-integration-test` are targets to execute unit and integration tests without rebuilding them.
   - `run-fuzz-test` is used to execute fuzz tests.

6. **Cleaning Targets**:
   - `clean` and `distclean` are used to remove build artifacts and temporary files, with `distclean` being more comprehensive.

7. **Dependency Management**:
   - The Makefile includes rules to generate and manage dependency files for C and C++ source files, ensuring that changes in source files trigger appropriate recompilation.

8. **Auxiliary and Dry Rules**:
   - `AUX_RULES` and `DRY_RULES` are defined to categorize rules that either do not set up dependencies or do not generate targets, respectively.

9. **LLVM Coverage**:
   - The Makefile includes steps to generate code coverage reports using LLVM tools, including merging profile data and generating HTML reports.

10. **Frontend Management**:
    - Targets like `frontend` and `frontend-clean` manage the build and cleanup of frontend components, with support for different release channels (stable, alpha, dev).

11. **Script and Example Management**:
    - Functions like `add-scripts` and `add-examples` are used to manage the inclusion of scripts and example files in the build process.

This Makefile is designed to streamline the build process, manage dependencies, and facilitate testing and code coverage analysis for a software project.
