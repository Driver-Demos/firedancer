Makefile for configuring GCC 15+ with Zen 5 optimizations and various architecture flags.

# Purpose
This Makefile is used to configure the build environment for a software project targeting the Zen 5 architecture using GCC. It sets the build directory to `linux/gcc/zen5` and includes several configuration files that add support for GCC, x86-64 architecture, debugging, security, optimization, and threading. The file checks the GCC version to ensure it is 15 or higher, as this version includes necessary optimizations for Zen 5. If the GCC version is not supported, an error message is displayed. The file also defines several preprocessor flags (`CPPFLAGS`) and variables to enable specific features such as `FD_HAS_INT128`, `FD_HAS_DOUBLE`, and various instruction set extensions like SSE, AVX, and AVX512.
