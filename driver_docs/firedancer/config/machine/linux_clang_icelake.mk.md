Makefile configuration for building with Clang on Intel Ice Lake architecture, including optimization and security flags.

# Purpose
The Makefile configuration specifies build settings and compiler flags for a software project targeting the `icelake` architecture using the Clang compiler. It sets the build directory to `linux/clang/icelake` and includes several configuration files to enable features such as debugging, security, optimization, and threading. The file defines preprocessor flags (`CPPFLAGS`) to optimize the build for the `icelake-server` architecture, enabling specific instruction sets like SSE, AVX, and AVX512. It also defines several macros (`FD_HAS_INT128`, `FD_HAS_DOUBLE`, etc.) to indicate the availability of certain features and optimizations in the build environment. The comments note limitations in Clang's optimization capabilities, suggesting that its use is currently limited to code hygiene purposes.
