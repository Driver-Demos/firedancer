Makefile for configuring a Linux GCC noarch64 build with various features and optimizations.

# Purpose
The Makefile sets the build directory to `linux/gcc/noarch64` and includes several configuration files to extend the build process with additional features such as GCC support, debugging, security, optimization, and threading. It defines preprocessor flags `CPPFLAGS` to enable double precision (`FD_HAS_DOUBLE=1`) and stack allocation (`FD_HAS_ALLOCA=1`). The variables `FD_HAS_DOUBLE` and `FD_HAS_ALLOCA` are also explicitly set to `1`, indicating that these features are enabled in the build.
