Makefile for configuring a build environment with Clang for Zen 4 architecture with various optimizations.

# Purpose
The configuration file sets up the build environment for a software project targeting the `zen4` architecture using the Clang compiler on a Linux system. It includes several configuration files that add specific features such as debugging, security, optimization, and threading capabilities. The `CPPFLAGS` variable is configured with compiler flags to optimize the build for the `znver4` architecture and enable various hardware features like SSE, AVX, and AES-NI. Additionally, several preprocessor definitions are set to indicate the presence of specific hardware capabilities, such as `FD_HAS_INT128` and `FD_HAS_AVX512`, which the software can use to optimize its performance.
