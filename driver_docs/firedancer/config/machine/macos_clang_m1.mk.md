Makefile for configuring build settings on macOS with Clang for Apple M1 architecture.

# Purpose
The Makefile configuration sets up the build environment for a macOS system using the Clang compiler on an Apple M1 chip. It specifies the build directory as `macos/clang/m1` and includes several configuration files to extend the base settings with Clang-specific, debug, and optimization options. The file contains commented instructions for installing LLVM and setting the compiler and linker paths. It defines several preprocessor flags (`CPPFLAGS`) to enable specific features such as 128-bit integers, double precision, and stack allocation. Additionally, it configures the build to use the Apple M1 CPU architecture and sets flags related to environment, I/O, and logging styles, which are currently disabled for macOS.
