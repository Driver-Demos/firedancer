Makefile for building with Clang on x86_64 with SSE support, including various configuration options.

# Purpose
The Makefile configuration defines a build environment for compiling software using the Clang compiler targeting the x86_64 architecture with SSE (Streaming SIMD Extensions) support. The `BUILDDIR` variable specifies the directory for build outputs, indicating a Linux environment with Clang and SSE. The file includes several other configuration files, such as `config/base.mk` and various `config/extra/*.mk` files, to extend the build setup with additional features like debugging, security, optimization, and threading. The `CPPFLAGS` are set to optimize the build for the native architecture and enable specific features, such as support for 128-bit integers, double precision, and stack allocation. The file also defines several feature flags, such as `FD_HAS_INT128`, `FD_HAS_DOUBLE`, and `FD_HAS_SSE`, to ensure these capabilities are available during the build process.
