Makefile for configuring a build environment with Clang on a 128-bit architecture with various features.

# Purpose
The Makefile sets the build directory to `linux/clang/noarch128` and includes several configuration files to extend the build process with additional features such as Clang support, debugging, security, optimization, and threading. It defines preprocessor flags `CPPFLAGS` to enable specific features like 128-bit integers, double precision, and stack allocation with `alloca`. The variables `FD_HAS_INT128`, `FD_HAS_DOUBLE`, and `FD_HAS_ALLOCA` are set to `1` to indicate the presence of these features in the build environment.
