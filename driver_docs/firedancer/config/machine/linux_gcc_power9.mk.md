Makefile for configuring GCC build settings for Power9 architecture in the Firedancer project.

# Purpose
The Makefile configuration specifies the build environment and compilation settings for a software project targeting the Power9 architecture. It sets the build directory to `linux/gcc/power9` and includes several base and extra configuration files to extend the build setup. The `CPPFLAGS` and `LDFLAGS` are defined to include specific compiler and linker flags, such as `-mcpu=power9` for targeting the Power9 CPU and `-lm` for linking the math library. The file checks the machine architecture using `uname -m` and sets a cross-compilation flag if the architecture is not `ppc64le`. If cross-compilation is required, it defines the compiler and linker to use the PowerPC 64-bit little-endian GNU toolchain. Additional preprocessor flags are appended to `CPPFLAGS` to enable specific features like 128-bit integers, double precision, and stack allocation.
