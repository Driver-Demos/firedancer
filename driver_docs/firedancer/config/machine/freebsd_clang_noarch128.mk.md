Makefile for configuring a FreeBSD build with Clang and specific flags for integer, double, and memory allocation support.

# Purpose
The Makefile sets up the build environment for a FreeBSD system using the Clang compiler targeting a `noarch128` architecture. It includes several configuration files to extend the build settings, such as `base.mk`, `with-clang.mk`, `with-debug.mk`, `with-brutality.mk`, and `with-optimization.mk`. The `CPPFLAGS` variable is configured with preprocessor definitions to enable support for 128-bit integers, double precision floating-point numbers, and stack allocation with `alloca`. Additionally, it sets environment, I/O, and logging styles to zero, indicating a non-hosted environment for FreeBSD.
