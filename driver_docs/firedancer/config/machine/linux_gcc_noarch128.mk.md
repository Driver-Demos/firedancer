Makefile for configuring a Linux GCC build with specific flags and features for noarch128.

# Purpose
The Makefile sets up the build environment for a software project targeting a Linux system with a GCC compiler and a noarch128 architecture. It includes several configuration files to extend the build with additional features such as debugging, security, optimization, and threading. The file also defines preprocessor flags and variables to enable support for 128-bit integers, double precision floating-point numbers, and the `alloca` function.
