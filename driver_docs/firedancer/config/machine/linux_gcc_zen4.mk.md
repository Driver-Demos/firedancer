Makefile for configuring GCC build settings for Zen 4 architecture with various optimizations.

# Purpose
This Makefile is used to configure the build environment for a software project. It sets the default build directory to `linux/gcc/zen4` and includes several configuration files that define additional build options, such as support for GCC, x86-64 architecture, debugging, security, optimization, and threading. The file checks the version of GCC being used; if it is version 8, it sets the `CPPFLAGS` to use the `znver1` architecture, otherwise, it uses `znver4`. The `CPPFLAGS` are further extended with preprocessor definitions that enable various hardware and software features, such as 128-bit integers, double precision, stack allocation, and several x86 instruction set extensions like SSE, AVX, and AVX512. These flags ensure that the compiled code can utilize specific processor capabilities for performance optimization.
