Makefile for configuring GCC build settings optimized for Intel Ice Lake architecture in the Firedancer project.

# Purpose
The Makefile content configures the build environment for a software project targeting the `icelake` architecture using the GCC compiler. It sets the build directory to `linux/gcc/icelake` and includes several configuration files to enable specific features such as debugging, security, optimization, and threading. The `CPPFLAGS` variable is augmented with flags that define architecture-specific capabilities, such as support for AVX, SSE, and AES-NI instructions, and ensures the use of architecture-optimized memory functions. The file also checks the GCC compiler version to conditionally enable AVX-512 support, setting the `FD_HAS_AVX512` flag if the compiler version is 10 or higher. Various feature flags like `FD_HAS_INT128`, `FD_HAS_DOUBLE`, and others are defined to indicate the availability of specific hardware and software capabilities.
