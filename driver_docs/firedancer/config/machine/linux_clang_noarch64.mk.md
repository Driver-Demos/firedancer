Makefile for configuring a Linux build with Clang for noarch64, including various build options.

# Purpose
The Makefile sets the build directory to `linux/clang/noarch64` if it is not already defined. It includes several configuration files to extend the build setup with additional features such as Clang support, debugging, security, optimization, and threading. The `CPPFLAGS` variable is appended with preprocessor definitions `-DFD_HAS_DOUBLE=1` and `-DFD_HAS_ALLOCA=1`, which are also assigned as variables `FD_HAS_DOUBLE` and `FD_HAS_ALLOCA` with a value of `1`, indicating that the build should support double precision and stack allocation.
