Makefile for configuring a minimal Linux build with Clang, including debug, security, and optimization.

# Purpose
The Makefile sets up a build environment for a project using the Clang compiler on a Linux platform with a minimal configuration. It includes several configuration files to extend the build with additional features such as debugging, security, and optimization. The `CPPFLAGS` variable is modified to enable POSIX-style logging, which supports cross-platform development by defining specific macros (`FD_ENV_STYLE`, `FD_IO_STYLE`, `FD_LOG_STYLE`, and `_XOPEN_SOURCE`).
