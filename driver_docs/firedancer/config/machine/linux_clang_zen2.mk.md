Makefile for configuring a build environment with Clang for Zen 2 architecture, including various optimizations and security features.

# Purpose
The Makefile configuration specifies the build directory and includes several configuration files to set up the build environment for a software project. The `BUILDDIR` variable is set to `linux/clang/zen2`, indicating the target build directory. The file includes multiple configuration files from the `config/extra` directory, each adding specific build options such as support for Clang, x86-64 architecture, debugging, security, optimization, and threading. The `CPPFLAGS` variable is used to define preprocessor flags, including architecture-specific flags like `-march=znver1` and `-mtune=znver1`, due to Clang 15's lack of support for `znver2`. Additionally, several feature macros are defined, such as `FD_HAS_INT128`, `FD_HAS_DOUBLE`, and others, to enable specific hardware and software capabilities during the build process.
