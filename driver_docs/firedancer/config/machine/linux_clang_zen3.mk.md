Makefile for configuring build settings with Clang on Zen 3 architecture, including optimizations and security.

# Purpose
The configuration file defines build settings and compiler flags for a software project targeting the `zen3` architecture using the Clang compiler on a Linux system. It includes several configuration files, such as `base.mk` and various `with-*` files, to extend the build with additional features like debugging, security, optimization, and threading. The `CPPFLAGS` variable is set with specific flags to optimize the build for the `znver3` architecture and enable various processor features, such as SSE, AVX, and AES-NI. Additionally, preprocessor definitions are set to indicate the presence of certain features, such as 128-bit integers and double precision floating-point support. These settings ensure that the build process is tailored to the capabilities of the target architecture and the requirements of the software.
