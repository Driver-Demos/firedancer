Makefile for configuring a build environment with Clang on x86_64 Linux, including various optimizations and features.

# Purpose
The Makefile content configures the build environment for a software project. It sets the build directory to `linux/clang/x86_64` and includes several configuration files to extend the build setup with additional features such as debugging, security, optimization, and threading. The file also specifies compiler flags using `CPPFLAGS` to optimize the build for specific CPU architectures, such as Haswell and Skylake, and to enable certain features like 128-bit integers, double precision, and various x86 instruction sets. The file notes a limitation with Clang's optimization capabilities, suggesting its use primarily for code hygiene. The defined variables, such as `FD_HAS_INT128` and `FD_HAS_SSE`, indicate the presence of specific features in the build environment.
