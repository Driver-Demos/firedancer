Makefile for configuring a minimal Linux build with GCC, including debugging, security, and optimization.

# Purpose
The Makefile sets the build directory to `linux/gcc/minimal` and includes several configuration files to extend the build process with additional features such as GCC support, debugging, security, brutality, and optimization. It also modifies the `CPPFLAGS` to enable POSIX style logging by defining several macros (`FD_ENV_STYLE`, `FD_IO_STYLE`, `FD_LOG_STYLE`, and `_XOPEN_SOURCE`) to facilitate cross-platform development.
