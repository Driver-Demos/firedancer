Makefile for configuring GCC build settings for Zen 2 architecture with various optimizations and features.

# Purpose
The Makefile configures the build environment for a software project targeting the Zen 2 architecture using GCC. It sets the build directory to `linux/gcc/zen2` and includes several configuration files to enable specific features such as debugging, security, optimization, and threading. The file checks the GCC version and adjusts the compiler flags accordingly, using `znver1` for GCC version 8 and `znver2` for later versions. It defines preprocessor flags (`CPPFLAGS`) to enable various hardware and software features, such as 128-bit integers, double precision, and specific x86 instruction sets like SSE, AVX, SHANI, and AESNI. These flags ensure that the compiled code can utilize advanced processor capabilities for improved performance.
