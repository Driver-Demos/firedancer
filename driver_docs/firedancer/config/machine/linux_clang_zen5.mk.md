Makefile for configuring a build environment targeting AMD Zen 5 with Clang and various optimizations.

# Purpose
The Makefile configuration specifies the build directory and includes several configuration files to set up the build environment for a software project. The `BUILDDIR` variable is set to `linux/clang/zen5`, indicating the target directory for the build output. The file includes multiple configuration files, such as `config/base.mk` and various `config/extra/*.mk` files, which add specific build options like debugging, security, optimization, and threading. The `CPPFLAGS` variable is augmented with flags for the compiler, specifying architecture-specific optimizations for the Zen 5 architecture, such as `-march=znver5` and `-mtune=znver5`. Additionally, several preprocessor definitions are set to enable features like 128-bit integers, double precision, and various x86 instruction set extensions, including SSE, AVX, and AVX512.
