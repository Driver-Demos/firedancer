Makefile for building Firedancer on ARMv8.4-A CPUs with GCC, including experimental support and optimizations.

# Purpose
The Makefile configuration sets up the build environment for compiling software targeting ARMv8.4-A server CPUs, such as Neoverse V1 or AWS Graviton3. It specifies the build directory as `linux/gcc/arm_n1` and includes several configuration files to extend the build process with additional features like GCC support, ARM architecture compatibility, optimization, debugging, security, and threading. The file defines preprocessor flags `CPPFLAGS` to specify the target CPU as `neoverse-n1` and enables certain features by defining macros such as `FD_HAS_INT128`, `FD_HAS_DOUBLE`, and `FD_HAS_ALLOCA`. These macros indicate the availability of 128-bit integers, double-precision floating-point support, and stack allocation functions, respectively. The configuration is marked as experimental, indicating potential issues with ARM CPU support.
