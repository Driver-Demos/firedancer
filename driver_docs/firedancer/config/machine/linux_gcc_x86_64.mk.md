Makefile for configuring a Linux GCC x86_64 build with various optimizations and features.

# Purpose
The Makefile configuration sets up the build environment for a software project targeting a Linux system with a GCC compiler on an x86_64 architecture. It specifies the build directory with the variable `BUILDDIR`, defaulting to `linux/gcc/x86_64`, and includes several configuration files to extend the build setup with additional features such as debugging, security, optimization, and threading. The `CPPFLAGS` variable is augmented with specific compiler flags to optimize for the Haswell and Skylake microarchitectures and to define several preprocessor macros that enable features like 128-bit integers, double precision, stack allocation, and various x86 instruction sets including SSE and AVX. The file also sets several feature flags, such as `FD_HAS_INT128`, `FD_HAS_DOUBLE`, and others, to indicate the availability of these features in the build environment.
