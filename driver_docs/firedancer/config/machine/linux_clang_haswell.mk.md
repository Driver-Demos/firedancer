Makefile for configuring a build environment with Clang on Haswell architecture, including optimizations and security features.

# Purpose
The Makefile content specifies the build configuration for a software project targeting a Linux environment with the Clang compiler on the Haswell architecture. It sets the `BUILDDIR` variable to `linux/clang/haswell`, indicating the directory structure for the build output. The file includes several other configuration files, such as `config/base.mk` and various `config/extra/*.mk` files, to extend the build settings with additional features like debugging, security, optimization, and threading. The `CPPFLAGS` variable is augmented with compiler flags to optimize for the Haswell architecture and enable specific CPU features like AES-NI and AVX. Additionally, several preprocessor definitions are set to indicate the presence of certain features, such as 128-bit integers and SSE instructions, which are used to conditionally compile code that depends on these capabilities.
