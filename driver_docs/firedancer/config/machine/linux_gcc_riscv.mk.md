Makefile for configuring RISC-V cross-compilation with GCC, including flags and feature definitions.

# Purpose
This Makefile is used to configure the build environment for a software project targeting the RISC-V architecture. The `BUILDDIR` variable specifies the directory for build outputs, and several configuration files are included to extend the build settings. The file sets compiler flags such as `CPPFLAGS` and `LDFLAGS`, with `LDFLAGS` including the math library `-lm`. It checks the machine architecture and sets the `CROSS` variable to enable cross-compilation if the architecture is not `ppc64le`. When cross-compilation is enabled, it defines the compilers `CC`, `CXX`, and `LD` for the RISC-V target. Additional configuration files are included to enable features like optimization, debugging, security, and threading, and preprocessor flags are set to define specific capabilities such as `FD_HAS_INT128`, `FD_HAS_DOUBLE`, and `FD_HAS_ALLOCA`.
