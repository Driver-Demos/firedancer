Makefile for configuring GCC build settings optimized for Zen 3 architecture in the Firedancer project.

# Purpose
The Makefile configures the build environment for a software project targeting the Zen 3 architecture using GCC. It sets the `BUILDDIR` variable to specify the build directory and includes several configuration files to extend the build setup with additional features such as debugging, security, optimization, and threading. The file checks the GCC version to determine the appropriate architecture flags, using `znver1` for GCC 8 and `znver3` for later versions. It defines several preprocessor flags (`CPPFLAGS`) to enable specific hardware and software features, such as support for 128-bit integers, double precision, and various x86 instruction sets like SSE, AVX, SHANI, and AESNI. These flags ensure that the compiled code can utilize advanced processor capabilities for improved performance.
