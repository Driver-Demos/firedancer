Makefile configuration for build settings, compiler flags, and toolchain parameters in the Firedancer project.

# Purpose
This Makefile defines various build and compilation settings for a software project. It specifies default directories, tools, and flags used during the build process. The `BASEDIR` variable sets the base directory for build outputs, while `OPT` specifies an optional directory for additional includes. Compiler settings are defined with variables such as `CC`, `CXX`, and their respective flags `CFLAGS` and `CXXFLAGS`, which set standards and options for C and C++ compilation. The file also includes settings for Rust compilation with `RUSTFLAGS` and `RUST_PROFILE`, and it configures tools for code coverage analysis using LLVM and lcov. Additionally, it defines commands for file operations like `CP`, `RM`, and `MKDIR`, and includes parameters for running libFuzzer tests with `FUZZFLAGS`. The `FORTIFY_SOURCE` variable sets a default level for source fortification, enhancing security during compilation.
