Defines code ownership for directories and files in the `firedancer` codebase.

# Purpose
The `CODEOWNERS` file assigns responsibility for specific parts of a codebase to designated users or teams. The file specifies that the entire repository is under the oversight of the `@firedancer-admin` team. Specific directories and files have additional owners, such as `@0x0ece`, `@anwayde`, and others for the `/agave` directory, and `@ptaffet-jump` for the `/src/ballet/txn/fd_txn_parse.c` file. This structure helps manage code reviews and ensures that knowledgeable individuals are responsible for maintaining different sections of the codebase. By defining code ownership, the file facilitates efficient collaboration and accountability within the development team.
