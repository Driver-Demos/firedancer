A Bash script for managing dependencies in the Firedancer project, including fetching, checking, and installing them.

# Purpose
This script is a Bash configuration file used to manage the setup and installation of dependencies for the Firedancer project. It automates the process of fetching, building, and installing various software dependencies required by the project. The script supports multiple operating systems, including macOS, Linux distributions like Fedora, Debian, Alpine, and Arch Linux. It checks for required system packages and installs missing ones if necessary. The script also provides commands for different actions such as `fetch`, `check`, `install`, and `nuke`, which are used to manage dependencies, verify system requirements, and clean up installed files. The script is designed to be run from the root directory of the Firedancer project and uses environment variables and command-line arguments to customize its behavior, such as enabling development mode or memory sanitizer options.
# Content Summary
This script is a Bash configuration file designed to manage the setup, dependency fetching, and installation process for a software project named Firedancer. It is structured to handle various operating systems and package management systems, ensuring that all necessary dependencies are installed and configured correctly.

Key Functional Details:

1. **Environment Setup**: The script begins by setting strict error handling options (`set -euo pipefail`) and determining the operating system type (Darwin for macOS, Linux, or others). It sets up the `MAKE` command for parallel execution and identifies the need for `sudo` privileges if the script is not run as the root user.

2. **Directory and Prefix Configuration**: The script changes to the root directory of Firedancer and sets a default installation prefix (`PREFIX`) to a subdirectory named `opt` within the current directory.

3. **Command Definitions**: The script defines several commands that can be executed:
   - `help`: Displays usage information and available commands.
   - `check`: Verifies system requirements and checks for missing packages.
   - `nuke`: Removes all dependency checkouts and third-party files.
   - `fetch`: Clones necessary dependencies from Git repositories into the specified prefix.
   - `install`: Builds and installs all project dependencies into the specified prefix.

4. **Dependency Management**: The script includes functions to fetch and install various dependencies such as `zstd`, `lz4`, `s2n-bignum`, `openssl`, `secp256k1`, and others. It uses Git to clone repositories and CMake or Make to build and install these dependencies.

5. **Package Checks**: The script contains functions to check for required packages on different Linux distributions (Fedora, Debian, Alpine, Arch) and macOS. It identifies missing packages and provides commands to install them using the appropriate package manager (e.g., `dnf`, `apt-get`, `apk`, `brew`, `pacman`).

6. **Conditional Compilation**: The script supports optional modes such as `DEVMODE` for development dependencies and `MSAN` for memory sanitizer builds, adjusting compiler flags and dependencies accordingly.

7. **Execution Flow**: The script processes command-line arguments to determine which actions to perform. If no specific action is provided, it defaults to fetching, checking, and installing dependencies.

8. **User Interaction**: The script prompts the user for confirmation before proceeding with certain actions, such as installing missing packages or continuing with the default fetch-check-install sequence.

Overall, this script automates the setup and installation of dependencies for the Firedancer project, ensuring compatibility across different operating systems and package management systems.
