Sets environment variables for different Solana network configurations based on the provided network parameter.

# Purpose
This script is a Bash configuration file that sets environment variables based on the specified Solana network. It requires a network parameter, which can be `mainnet`, `testnet`, or `devnet`. Depending on the network selected, the script exports various environment variables such as `BUCKET_ENDPOINT`, `GENESIS_FILE`, `HEAP_SIZE`, and others, which are necessary for configuring the environment for that specific network. If an unknown network is provided, the script outputs an error message and returns a non-zero status. This script is intended to be sourced in a shell session to apply the environment settings.
