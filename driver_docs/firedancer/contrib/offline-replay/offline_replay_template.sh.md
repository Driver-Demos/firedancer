Shell script for setting environment variables and executing an offline replay script in Firedancer.

# Purpose
This script is a Bash configuration file that sets up environment variables and executes a script for offline replay operations. It defines paths to the Firedancer and Agave repositories, specifying the branch and tool locations. Network-specific parameters such as the network type, billing project ID, and Slack webhook URLs for notifications are also configured. The script includes paths to files necessary for offline replay, such as the latest bucket slot file and network parameters file, and ensures these files are executable. Finally, it runs the offline replay script, which is essential for processing or testing network data in an offline environment.
