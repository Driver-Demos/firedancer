Configuration settings for offline replay in the Firedancer codebase.

# Purpose
The configuration file defines various settings for a software application. The `[layout]` section specifies the `shred_tile_count`, which is set to 4. The `[tiles]` section configures different components such as `archiver`, `replay`, and `gui`, with specific settings like enabling the archiver and setting the ingest mode to `rocksdb`. The `[funk]` section sets parameters for memory management, including `heap_size_gib` and `max_account_records`. The `[runtime]` section configures execution parameters, such as `max_live_slots` and `max_fork_width`, and includes a sub-section for `program_cache` with a specified `heap_size_mib`. The `[consensus]` section has a `vote` setting, while the `[development]` section includes flags for development features like `sandbox` and `no_clone`. The `[log]` section specifies logging configurations, including the log level and path. The `[paths]` section defines the location for `snapshots`, and the `[snapshots]` section manages snapshot-related settings, such as download options and speed limits. Finally, the `[gossip]` section lists network entry points.
