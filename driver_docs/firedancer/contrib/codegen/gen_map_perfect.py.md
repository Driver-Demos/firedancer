Generates perfect hash functions for various key tables using base58 decoding and bit manipulation.

# Purpose
The code is a script that performs perfect hashing on several lists of encoded strings. It uses the `b58decode` function from the `base58` library to decode the strings and then applies bitwise operations to generate hash values. The script defines four lists: `fd_pubkey_pending_reserved_keys_tbl`, `fd_native_program_fn_lookup_tbl`, `fd_pack_builtin`, and `fd_pack_unwritable`. Each list contains strings that represent identifiers or keys. The script calculates a perfect hash for each list by iterating over a range of constants (`c`) and checking if the hash values are unique for the list. If a unique set of hash values is found, it prints the constant `c` that achieves this.

The script includes two main hashing functions, [`map_perfect_4`](<#map_perfect_4>) and [`map_perfect_5`](<#map_perfect_5>), which differ in the number of bits they consider for the hash. The script uses these functions to determine the perfect hash constant for each list. The script also includes a commented-out section that suggests a parallelized approach using the `multiprocessing` library to find the perfect hash constant over a large range of values. This indicates that the script is designed to efficiently find perfect hash functions for large datasets by leveraging parallel processing capabilities.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `base58.b58decode`
- `multiprocessing.Pool`
- `random`
- `math`


# Global Variables

---
### fd\_pubkey\_pending\_reserved\_keys\_tbl
- **Type**: ``list``
- **Description**: A list of strings that represent public key identifiers. Each string in the list is a unique identifier for a specific reserved key.
- **Use**: Used to store and manage a collection of reserved public key identifiers for further processing or lookup operations.


---
### fd\_native\_program\_fn\_lookup\_tbl
- **Type**: ``list``
- **Description**: Contains a list of strings that represent identifiers for various native programs. Each string is a unique identifier, likely used to reference specific programs or functionalities within a larger system.
- **Use**: Used to store and access identifiers for native programs, potentially for lookup or mapping operations.


---
### fd\_pack\_builtin
- **Type**: ``list``
- **Description**: Contains a list of string identifiers that represent various program and system components. Each string in the list is a unique identifier, often padded with '1's to a fixed length.
- **Use**: Used to store identifiers for built-in programs and components, likely for lookup or validation purposes.


---
### fd\_pack\_unwritable
- **Type**: ``list``
- **Description**: Contains a list of strings that represent system variables, programs, and extra components that are not writable. Each string is a unique identifier for a specific component in the system.
- **Use**: Used to store identifiers of components that should not be modified, likely for security or integrity purposes.


---
### arr
- **Type**: ``list``
- **Description**: A list that contains the results of applying the `map_perfect_el` function to each element in the `fd_pack_unwritable` list. The `map_perfect_el` function decodes a base58 string and extracts a 32-bit integer from specific byte positions.
- **Use**: Used to store transformed elements from `fd_pack_unwritable` for further processing in a loop that searches for a specific constant `c`.


# Functions

---
### map\_perfect\_el<!-- {{#callable:firedancer/contrib/codegen/gen_map_perfect.map_perfect_el}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../contrib/codegen/gen_map_perfect.py#L88>)

Decodes a Base58-encoded string and extracts a 32-bit integer from specific byte positions.
- **Inputs**:
    - `s`: A Base58-encoded string to decode and process.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Decode the input string `s` using the `b58decode` function to obtain a byte sequence `x`.
    - Extract bytes from positions 8 to 11 in the byte sequence `x`.
    - Combine these bytes into a single 32-bit integer using bitwise operations.
- **Output**: A 32-bit integer derived from the decoded byte sequence.


---
### map\_perfect\_4<!-- {{#callable:firedancer/contrib/codegen/gen_map_perfect.map_perfect_4}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../contrib/codegen/gen_map_perfect.py#L92>)

Calculates a 4-bit hash value from two integer inputs using bitwise operations.
- **Inputs**:
    - `k`: An integer value used as a key in the hash calculation.
    - `c`: An integer value used as a constant multiplier in the hash calculation.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Multiply `k` by `c`.
    - Shift the result right by 28 bits (32-4).
    - Apply a bitwise AND operation with 0x0F to extract the lower 4 bits of the result.
- **Output**: Returns an integer representing the 4-bit hash value.


---
### map\_perfect\_5<!-- {{#callable:firedancer/contrib/codegen/gen_map_perfect.map_perfect_5}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../contrib/codegen/gen_map_perfect.py#L95>)

Calculates a hash value by multiplying two integers, shifting the result, and applying a bitmask.
- **Inputs**:
    - `k`: An integer used as a key in the hash calculation.
    - `c`: An integer used as a constant multiplier in the hash calculation.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Multiply the input `k` by the input `c`.
    - Right shift the result by 27 bits (32-5).
    - Apply a bitmask of `0x1F` to the shifted result to obtain the final hash value.
- **Output**: An integer representing the calculated hash value.
