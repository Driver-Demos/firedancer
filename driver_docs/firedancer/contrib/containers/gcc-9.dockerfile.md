Dockerfile for setting up a Rocky Linux 8 environment with GCC Toolset 9, CMake 3.26.5, and Rust.

# Purpose
This Dockerfile sets up a container environment based on the `rockylinux:8` image. It installs the GCC Toolset 9, which includes essential development tools, and configures the environment to use this toolset by default. The file also downloads and installs a pre-built binary of CMake version 3.26.5, creating symbolic links for easy access to CMake commands. Additionally, it installs Rust using `rustup`, setting up the environment to use Rust by default. The working directory is set to `/data/firedancer`, and the default command to run when the container starts is `/bin/bash`.
