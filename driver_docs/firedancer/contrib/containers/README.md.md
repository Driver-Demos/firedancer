Instructions for building and running GCC containers using Dockerfiles in the Firedancer repository.

# Purpose
The document provides instructions for building and running Docker containers with different versions of the GCC compiler (GCC 8, GCC 9, and GCC 10). It includes commands to build the container using `podman` and specifies how to run the container with the repository's top directory mounted at `/data/firedancer`. The document also outlines steps to build binaries within the container, emphasizing the need to clean up existing files when switching compilers. A warning is included to highlight that cleanup operations inside the container will affect files on the host system, suggesting the use of a fresh clone of the repository to prevent unwanted data loss. Finally, it provides commands to install dependencies and compile the desired targets.
