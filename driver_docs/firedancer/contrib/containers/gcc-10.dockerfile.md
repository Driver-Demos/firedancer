Dockerfile for a Rocky Linux 8 container with GCC Toolset 10, CMake 3.26.5, and Rust.

# Purpose
The Dockerfile sets up a container environment based on the `rockylinux:8` image. It installs the GCC Toolset 10, which includes essential development tools like GCC, and configures the environment to use this toolset by default. The file also downloads and installs a pre-built binary of CMake version 3.26.5, creating symbolic links for easy access to CMake commands. Additionally, it installs Rust using `rustup`, setting up the environment to use Rust by default. The working directory is set to `/data/firedancer`, and the default command to run when the container starts is `/bin/bash`.
