Bash script to load specific modules for Jump's environment, including GCC, Python, and OpenSSL.

# Purpose
This script is a Bash executable intended to configure the environment for a specific software setup. It checks for the presence of the `module` command, which is necessary for managing environment modules, and outputs an error message if the command is not found, indicating that the script is designed to run within Jump's environment. The script purges any currently loaded modules and then loads specific versions of `gcc`, `Python`, and `openssl`, ensuring that the environment is set up with these tools. Finally, it lists the currently loaded modules to confirm the environment configuration.
