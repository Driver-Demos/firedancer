Bash script to install and activate Clang 15.0 for development environments.

# Purpose
This script is a Bash executable intended for internal use, specifically for managing development environments. It provides narrow functionality by checking if the first argument is "install" and, if so, installs the `jump_module_clang-15.0` package using the `yum` package manager. After the installation, or if no arguments are provided, the script purges all currently loaded modules and loads the `clang-15.0` module. Finally, it lists all currently loaded modules to confirm the environment setup.
