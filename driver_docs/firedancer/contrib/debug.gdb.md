A GDB script to set a breakpoint at `fd_log_private_2`, run the program, and exit if successful.

# Purpose
The file contains a script for a debugger that sets a breakpoint at the function `fd_log_private_2`. It then runs the program and checks if the exit code is 0. If the exit code is 0, the script instructs the debugger to quit.
