Build script for downloading, building, and running Doxygen with specific configurations.

# Purpose
The script automates the process of downloading, building, and running Doxygen, a documentation generator tool. It first checks if the Doxygen repository is already cloned; if not, it clones the repository from GitHub. The script then verifies if the Doxygen binary exists in the specified directory. If the binary is not present, it removes any existing build directories, creates necessary directories, and compiles Doxygen using CMake with specific configuration options. After building, the script runs Doxygen with a specified configuration file to generate documentation, storing the output in a designated directory.
