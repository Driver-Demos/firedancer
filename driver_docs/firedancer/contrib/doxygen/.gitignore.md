Specifies files and directories to ignore in version control for Doxygen-related content.

# Purpose
The file lists directories that are likely part of a software project's structure. The `/doxygen` directory may contain documentation generated by Doxygen, a tool for generating documentation from annotated source code. The `/opt` directory is typically used for optional software packages or add-ons. The `/dist` directory is often used to store distribution files, such as compiled binaries or packaged software ready for deployment.
