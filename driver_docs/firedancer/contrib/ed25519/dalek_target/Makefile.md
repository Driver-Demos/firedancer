Build and clean targets for Rust project with specific RUSTFLAGS and version 1.76.0.

# Purpose
The `Makefile` configures the build process for a Rust project. It sets `RUSTFLAGS` to include specific compiler options for sanitizer coverage and debugging, such as `-Cpasses=sancov-module` and `-Clink-dead-code`. The `RUST_VERSION` is specified as `1.76.0`, and the `CARGO` command is set to `cargo` by default. The `build` target compiles the project using the specified Rust version and target architecture `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` in release mode. The `clean` target removes build artifacts using the `cargo clean` command. The `.PHONY` directive declares `clean` and `build` as phony targets, indicating they are not associated with actual files.
