Configuration for the `dalek_target` package, specifying dependencies and library type.

# Purpose
The `Cargo.toml` file specifies metadata and configuration for a Rust package. The `[package]` section defines the package name as `dalek_target`, sets the version to `0.1.0`, specifies the Rust edition as `2021`, and indicates that the package should not be published. The `[lib]` section sets the crate type to `cdylib`, which is a dynamic system library. The `[dependencies]` section lists `ed25519-dalek` as a dependency with a fixed version of `1.0.1`.
