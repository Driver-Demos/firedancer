Integrates Firedancer's QUIC implementation with Quinn, including server certificate verification bypass.

# Purpose
The code defines a function `quinn_to_fdquic` that integrates the Quinn library with Firedancer's QUIC implementation. It sets up a UDP socket and a QUIC server using Firedancer's components, such as `fd_udpsock_t` and `fd_quic_t`. The function configures the QUIC server to operate in server mode and optionally logs network traffic to a PCAP file if the `PCAP` environment variable is set. The function also includes a custom certificate verifier `IgnoreServerCert` that bypasses standard certificate verification, allowing for testing or development purposes without strict security checks.

The function uses the Tokio runtime to asynchronously establish a QUIC client connection using the Quinn library. It configures the client with a custom certificate verifier and sets the ALPN protocol to "solana-tpu". The client connects to the local QUIC server, and the connection is dropped after establishment. The function manages the lifecycle of the QUIC server and UDP socket, ensuring proper initialization and shutdown. It also includes assertions to verify the correct operation of the QUIC server, such as packet counts and connection states.

# Data Structures

---
### IgnoreServerCert
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Description**: Implements a `ServerCertVerifier` that ignores server certificate verification, always returning successful verification results for server certificates and TLS signatures.

**Methods**

---
#### IgnoreServerCert::supported\_verify\_schemes
Returns a vector containing the supported signature schemes for server certificate verification.
- **Inputs**:
    - `&self`: A reference to the instance of the `IgnoreServerCert` struct.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Create a vector containing a single element, `SignatureScheme::ED25519`.
    - Return the vector.
- **Output**: A `Vec<SignatureScheme>` containing the supported signature schemes.


---
#### IgnoreServerCert::verify\_server\_cert
Bypasses server certificate verification and always returns a successful verification result.
- **Inputs**:
    - `&self`: A reference to the instance of `IgnoreServerCert` that implements the `ServerCertVerifier` trait.
    - `_: &CertificateDer<'_>`: The server certificate to verify, which is ignored in this implementation.
    - `_: &[CertificateDer<'_>]`: The chain of certificates leading to the server certificate, which is ignored in this implementation.
    - `_: &rustls::pki_types::ServerName<'_>`: The server name for which the certificate is presented, which is ignored in this implementation.
    - `_: &[u8]`: The signature of the server certificate, which is ignored in this implementation.
    - `_: UnixTime`: The time at which the certificate is verified, which is ignored in this implementation.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Ignores all input parameters related to server certificate verification.
    - Returns a `ServerCertVerified` object using the `assertion` method, indicating successful verification.
- **Output**: A `Result` containing `ServerCertVerified` on success, or a `rustls::Error` on failure, but this implementation always returns success.


---
#### IgnoreServerCert::verify\_tls12\_signature
Validates a TLS 1.2 signature during a server certificate verification process.
- **Inputs**:
    - `&self`: A reference to the `IgnoreServerCert` instance.
    - `_`: A byte slice representing the message to verify.
    - `_`: A reference to the `CertificateDer` structure containing the server's certificate.
    - `_`: A reference to the `DigitallySignedStruct` containing the signature to verify.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Return `Ok(HandshakeSignatureValid::assertion())` to indicate the signature is valid.
- **Output**: A `Result` containing `HandshakeSignatureValid` if the signature is valid, or a `rustls::Error` if it is not.


---
#### IgnoreServerCert::verify\_tls13\_signature
Verifies a TLS 1.3 signature and returns a valid handshake signature assertion.
- **Inputs**:
    - `&self`: A reference to the instance of the `IgnoreServerCert` struct.
    - `_`: A byte slice representing the message to verify.
    - `_`: A reference to a `CertificateDer` object representing the certificate.
    - `_`: A reference to a `DigitallySignedStruct` object representing the digitally signed structure.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Return a `HandshakeSignatureValid::assertion()` to indicate a valid handshake signature.
- **Output**: A `Result` containing `HandshakeSignatureValid` on success or a `rustls::Error` on failure.



# Functions

---
### quinn\_to\_fdquic
Integrates Firedancer and Quinn components to establish a QUIC server-client communication setup.
- **Inputs**:
    - `crypto_provider`: A `CryptoProvider` instance used to configure the cryptographic settings for the client.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Create a new UDP socket and Firedancer workspace.
    - Initialize a random number generator (`rng`) and allocate memory for a UDP socket (`udpsock`).
    - Join the UDP socket to the Firedancer network stack and set its layer to IP.
    - Create a new QUIC instance (`quic`) with server role and configure it to retry connections.
    - Check for the presence of a `PCAP` environment variable to determine if packet capture is enabled.
    - If packet capture is enabled, open a file for writing, start packet capture, and set up asynchronous I/O for packet capture.
    - If packet capture is not enabled, set up direct asynchronous I/O between the UDP socket and QUIC instance.
    - Initialize the QUIC instance and assert its success.
    - Spawn a thread to service the UDP socket and QUIC instance, monitoring packet metrics and ensuring constraints are met.
    - Set up a Tokio runtime for asynchronous operations and configure a Quinn client with custom certificate verification.
    - Connect the Quinn client to the server and establish a QUIC connection.
    - Signal the thread to stop and join it back to the main thread.
    - Call `fd_halt` to clean up resources.
- **Output**: None


---
### tls\_keylog\_cb
Logs TLS key information to a PCAP file for debugging purposes.
- **Inputs**:
    - `_ctx`: A pointer to a context, which is not used in this function.
    - `line`: A pointer to a C-style string containing the TLS key log line.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - The function is defined as an unsafe external C function, indicating it is intended to be used as a callback from C code.
    - It calls `fd_pcapng_fwrite_tls_key_log` to write the TLS key log line to a global PCAP file.
    - The length of the line is calculated using `strlen` and passed to the `fd_pcapng_fwrite_tls_key_log` function.
- **Output**: There is no return value as the function is defined to return `void`.
