Build script for setting up library paths and generating Rust bindings using bindgen.

# Purpose
This Rust code is a build script, typically named `build.rs`, used in a Rust project to configure and customize the build process. The script interacts with the Cargo build system to specify additional build instructions. It sets up the search paths for native libraries and links them statically to the Rust project. The script retrieves the `CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR` environment variable to determine the project's root directory and constructs paths to the native libraries and include directories. It specifies several libraries, such as `fd_quic`, `fd_waltz`, `fd_tls`, `fd_tango`, `fd_ballet`, and `fd_util`, to be linked statically, and it ensures that the build process will rerun if any of the specified static libraries change.

Additionally, the script uses the `bindgen` tool to generate Rust bindings for C/C++ code. It configures `bindgen` to process a header file named `wrapper.h`, allowing types, functions, and variables that match specific patterns to be included in the generated bindings. The generated bindings are written to a file in the output directory specified by the `OUT_DIR` environment variable. This build script is essential for integrating C/C++ code with Rust, ensuring that the necessary native components are correctly linked and accessible from the Rust codebase.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `std::env`
- `std::path::PathBuf`
- `bindgen`


# Functions

---
### main
Configures the build environment for a Rust project by setting library search paths, linking static libraries, and generating Rust bindings for C/C++ headers.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Retrieve the `CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR` environment variable and create a `PathBuf` object for the build path by navigating up three directories and appending 'build/native/gcc'.
    - Clone the build path to create a library path, append 'lib', and print the library search path using `println!`.
    - Iterate over a list of library names, printing commands to link each library statically and to rerun the build script if the corresponding library file changes.
    - Print a command to link the 'stdc++' library statically.
    - Clone the build path to create an include path and configure a `bindgen::Builder` to generate Rust bindings for C/C++ headers, allowing specific types, functions, and variables.
    - Print a command to rerun the build script if 'wrapper.h' changes.
    - Retrieve the `OUT_DIR` environment variable, create a path for the output file, and write the generated bindings to 'bindings.rs'.
- **Output**: No return value; side effects include printing build configuration commands and writing a bindings file.
