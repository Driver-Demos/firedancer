Implements a loopback packet connection for testing UDP communication in Go.

# Purpose
The code defines a Go package that implements a loopback network connection using the `net.PacketConn` interface. The primary component is the `loopbackPacketConn` struct, which simulates a network connection by using channels to transmit and receive byte slices. This struct includes fields for transmission (`tx`) and reception (`rx`) channels, local and peer addresses, and contexts for managing transmission and reception operations. The `log` field is used to enable logging of packet transmissions and receptions.

The `makeLoopbackPacketConnPair` function creates a pair of `loopbackPacketConn` instances that are connected to each other. This function initializes the transmission and reception channels and sets up the local and peer addresses for each connection. It also initializes the context and cancel functions for managing the lifecycle of the connections.

The `loopbackPacketConn` struct implements several methods required by the `net.PacketConn` interface. These methods include `ReadFrom`, `WriteTo`, `Close`, `LocalAddr`, `SetDeadline`, `SetReadDeadline`, and `SetWriteDeadline`. The `ReadFrom` and `WriteTo` methods handle reading from and writing to the connection, respectively, using the channels. The `Close` method cancels the contexts and sets the transmission channel to nil, effectively closing the connection. The deadline methods manage the timing for read and write operations using context deadlines. The code concludes with a type assertion to ensure that `loopbackPacketConn` satisfies the `net.PacketConn` interface.

    - ``peerAddr``: A pointer to a `net.UDPAddr` representing the peer address.
    - ``txContext``: A `context.Context` for managing the transmission context.
    - ``txCancel``: A `context.CancelFunc` to cancel the transmission context.
    - ``rxContext``: A `context.Context` for managing the reception context.
    - ``rxCancel``: A `context.CancelFunc` to cancel the reception context.
    - ``log``: A boolean flag to enable or disable logging.

# Functions

---
### makeLoopbackPacketConnPair
Creates a pair of `loopbackPacketConn` objects that simulate a network connection between two UDP addresses using channels for data transmission.
- **Inputs**:
    - `leftAddr`: A pointer to a `net.UDPAddr` representing the local address for the left connection.
    - `rightAddr`: A pointer to a `net.UDPAddr` representing the local address for the right connection.
    - `leftToRight`: A channel for transmitting byte slices from the left connection to the right connection.
    - `rightToLeft`: A channel for transmitting byte slices from the right connection to the left connection.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Initialize a `loopbackPacketConn` object `peerLeft` with `leftToRight` as the transmit channel, `rightToLeft` as the receive channel, `leftAddr` as the local address, and `rightAddr` as the peer address.
    - Initialize a `loopbackPacketConn` object `peerRight` with `rightToLeft` as the transmit channel, `leftToRight` as the receive channel, `rightAddr` as the local address, and `leftAddr` as the peer address.
    - Set the transmit and receive contexts for both `peerLeft` and `peerRight` to background contexts with no cancellation functions.
    - Return the `peerLeft` and `peerRight` objects as a pair.
- **Output**: A pair of pointers to `loopbackPacketConn` objects, representing the left and right connections.


---
### ReadFrom
Reads data from the receive channel and returns the number of bytes read, the address of the sender, and any error encountered.
- **Inputs**:
    - `p`: A byte slice where the function will copy the received data.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Waits for data to be available on the `rx` channel or for the `rxContext` to be done.
    - If data is received from the `rx` channel, checks if the channel is closed.
    - If the channel is closed, returns 0, nil, and `net.ErrClosed`.
    - Copies the received data into the byte slice `p`.
    - Sets the sender's address to `ns.peerAddr`.
    - Logs the received data if logging is enabled.
    - Returns the number of bytes copied, the sender's address, and nil error.
    - If the `rxContext` is done, returns the error from `rxContext.Err()`.
- **Output**: Returns the number of bytes read, the sender's address, and an error if any.


---
### WriteTo
Sends a byte slice to a specified address through a channel in a loopback packet connection.
- **Inputs**:
    - `p`: A byte slice that contains the data to send.
    - `addr`: A network address to which the data is sent.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Checks if the `tx` channel is `nil`, and if so, returns an error `net.ErrClosed`.
    - Creates a new byte slice `p2` with the same length as `p` and copies the contents of `p` into `p2`.
    - Uses a `select` statement to attempt to send `p2` through the `tx` channel.
    - If the send operation is successful, sets `n` to the length of `p2` and logs the transmission if logging is enabled.
    - If the `txContext` is done, returns the error from `txContext.Err()`.
- **Output**: Returns the number of bytes written and an error, if any.


---
### Close
Closes the `loopbackPacketConn` by canceling its transmission and reception contexts and setting its transmission channel to nil.
- **Inputs**:
    - `none`: The function does not take any input arguments.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Call the `txCancel` function to cancel the transmission context.
    - Call the `rxCancel` function to cancel the reception context.
    - Set the `tx` channel to `nil` to indicate that the connection is closed.
- **Output**: Returns `nil` to indicate successful closure.


---
### LocalAddr
Returns the local network address of the `loopbackPacketConn` instance.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Returns the `localAddr` field of the `loopbackPacketConn` instance.
- **Output**: The function returns a `net.Addr` which represents the local network address.


---
### SetDeadline
Sets both the read and write deadlines for the `loopbackPacketConn` instance.
- **Inputs**:
    - `t`: A `time.Time` value that specifies the deadline to set for both reading and writing operations.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Calls the `SetReadDeadline` method with the provided deadline `t`.
    - Calls the `SetWriteDeadline` method with the provided deadline `t`.
    - Returns `nil` indicating successful execution.
- **Output**: Returns `nil` to indicate that the operation completed successfully.


---
### SetReadDeadline
Sets a deadline for reading operations on the `loopbackPacketConn` by updating the receive context with a new deadline.
- **Inputs**:
    - `t`: A `time.Time` value that specifies the deadline for reading operations.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Cancel the current receive context by calling `ns.rxCancel()`.
    - Create a new receive context with the specified deadline using `context.WithDeadline(context.Background(), t)`.
    - Assign the new context and cancel function to `ns.rxContext` and `ns.rxCancel`, respectively.
    - Return `nil` to indicate successful execution.
- **Output**: Returns `nil` to indicate that the deadline was set successfully.


---
### SetWriteDeadline
Sets a deadline for write operations on the `loopbackPacketConn` by updating the transmission context with a new deadline.
- **Inputs**:
    - `t`: A `time.Time` value that specifies the deadline for write operations.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Cancel the current transmission context using `ns.txCancel()`.
    - Create a new transmission context with the specified deadline using `context.WithDeadline(context.Background(), t)`.
    - Assign the new context and cancel function to `ns.txContext` and `ns.txCancel`, respectively.
- **Output**: Returns an error if the operation fails, otherwise returns nil.
