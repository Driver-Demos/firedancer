Configuration for Go module dependencies and toolchain version for post-quantum key exchange.

# Purpose
The `go.mod` file specifies the module path as `github.com/firedancer-io/firedancer/contrib/quic/go_compat` and sets the Go language version to 1.23.0, which enables post-quantum key exchange. It defines the toolchain version as `go1.23.6`. The file lists direct dependencies required for the module, including `github.com/quic-go/quic-go` version `v0.54.1` and `golang.org/x/net` version `v0.40.0`. Additionally, it includes several indirect dependencies, such as `github.com/francoispqt/gojay`, `go.uber.org/mock`, and various packages from `golang.org/x`, which are necessary for the module's functionality but not directly imported in the module's source code.
