A function to send random-sized data batches to a specified destination using a QUIC connection.

# Purpose
The code defines a function named `blast` that sends a batch of data packets to a specified destination address using a connection from a connection cache. The function takes a `String` parameter `dst`, which represents the destination address. It resolves this address to a socket address using the `to_socket_addrs` method. The function uses a constant buffer `BUF` of 1193 bytes, which contains predefined data to be sent. The `ConnectionCache` and `ClientConnection` from the `solana_client` and `solana_connection_cache` crates are used to manage and retrieve connections for sending data.

The `blast` function creates a batch of data packets with random sizes and sends them in a loop using the `send_data_batch` method of the `ClientConnection`. The loop continues indefinitely, generating a random number of packets to send in each iteration. The function uses a random number generator from the `rand` crate to determine the number of packets and their sizes. It also keeps track of the total number of packets sent and logs this information to the standard error output every time an additional 10,000 packets are sent. The function handles any errors that occur during the sending process by printing the error details.

### blast
Sends random-sized batches of predefined data to a specified destination address in an infinite loop.
- **Inputs**:
    - `dst`: A `String` representing the destination address to which data will be sent.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Convert the `dst` string to a socket address using `to_socket_addrs` and retrieve the first address.
    - Define a constant buffer `BUF` containing a predefined array of bytes.
    - Create a new QUIC connection cache with a specified name and size.
    - Retrieve a connection from the connection cache using the socket address.
    - Initialize a vector `batch` to store batches of data to send.
    - Create a random number generator `rng` and initialize counters `sent` and `sent_stat` to zero.
    - Enter an infinite loop to repeatedly send data batches.
    - In each iteration, generate a random count `cnt` for the number of batches to send, clear the `batch` vector, and fill it with random-sized slices of `BUF`.
    - Attempt to send the data batch using the connection; if an error occurs, print the error.
    - Increment the `sent` counter by the number of batches sent.
    - If the difference between `sent` and `sent_stat` exceeds 10,000, print the total number of batches sent and update `sent_stat`.
- **Output**: This function does not return a value; it operates indefinitely, sending data batches to the specified destination.
