Header file with macro definitions and includes for network and QUIC functionalities.

# Purpose
This code is a C source file that sets up preprocessor directives and includes necessary headers for a network-related application. The `#define` statements configure the environment by indicating the presence of hosted capabilities, threading support, double precision floating-point support, and stack allocation with `alloca`. The included headers provide functionalities for handling network packet capture (`fd_pcapng.h`), QUIC protocol operations (`fd_quic.h`), QUIC testing utilities (`fd_quic_test_helpers.h`), and UDP socket operations (`fd_udpsock.h`). This setup suggests that the file is part of a larger system dealing with network communication and testing, specifically using the Firedancer library.
