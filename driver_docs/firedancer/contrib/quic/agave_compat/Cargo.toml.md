Configuration for the `firedancer-agave-quic-test` package with dependencies and build settings.

# Purpose
The `Cargo.toml` file specifies the configuration for a Rust package named `firedancer-agave-quic-test`. It defines the package version as `0.1.0`, uses the 2021 edition of Rust, and indicates that the package is not intended for publishing. The file also specifies a custom build script `build.rs`. The `build-dependencies` section lists `bindgen` version `0.70` as a build dependency. The `dependencies` section includes several runtime dependencies with specified versions, such as `crossbeam-channel`, `env_logger`, `libc`, `rand`, and various `solana` libraries, which are required for the package's functionality.
