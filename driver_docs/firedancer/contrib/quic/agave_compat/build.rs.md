Build script for setting up library paths, linking static libraries, and generating Rust bindings.

# Purpose
This code is a build script for a Rust project, typically named `build.rs`. It configures the build process by specifying library paths and generating Rust bindings for C/C++ code. The script starts by determining the path to the project's root directory using the `CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR` environment variable. It constructs paths to the `build/native/gcc` directory, where it expects to find static libraries and include files. The script then instructs Cargo to link against several static libraries, such as `fd_quic`, `fd_waltz`, and others, by using the `cargo:rustc-link-lib` directive. It also specifies that the build should be re-triggered if any of these libraries change.

Additionally, the script uses the `bindgen` tool to generate Rust bindings for C/C++ code. It specifies a header file, `wrapper.h`, and configures `bindgen` to include types, functions, and variables that match certain patterns (e.g., starting with `fd_`). The generated bindings are written to a file in the output directory specified by the `OUT_DIR` environment variable. This process allows Rust code to interface with the C/C++ libraries, facilitating integration between Rust and native code components.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `std::env`
- `std::path::PathBuf`
- `bindgen`


# Functions

---
### main
Configures the build environment for a Rust project by setting library paths, linking static libraries, and generating Rust bindings for C/C++ headers.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Retrieve the `CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR` environment variable and create a `PathBuf` object `build_path` by navigating up three directories and appending 'build/native/gcc'.
    - Clone `build_path` to `lib_path` and append 'lib' to it.
    - Print the library search path using `println!` with the `lib_path`.
    - Iterate over a list of library names, printing link instructions and change detection instructions for each library.
    - Print a link instruction for the `stdc++` library.
    - Clone `build_path` to `include_path` and append 'include' to it.
    - Create a `bindgen::Builder` to generate Rust bindings from the `wrapper.h` header file, specifying include paths and allowing specific types, functions, and variables.
    - Print a change detection instruction for `wrapper.h`.
    - Retrieve the `OUT_DIR` environment variable, create a `PathBuf` `out_path`, and write the generated bindings to a file named `bindings.rs` in `out_path`.
- **Output**: No return value; side effects include printing configuration instructions and writing a file.
