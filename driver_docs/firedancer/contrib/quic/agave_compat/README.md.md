Integration test for fd_quic and solana-streamer with setup and usage instructions.

# Purpose
The directory contains an integration test for `fd_quic` and `solana-streamer`. To use the test, install the necessary development libraries for Clang on your system using `sudo apt install -y libclang-dev` for Debian-based systems or `sudo dnf install -y clang-devel` for Fedora-based systems. Then, build the project in release mode with `cargo build --release` and execute the test by running `./target/release/firedancer-agave-quic-test` with either the `server` or `client` argument.
