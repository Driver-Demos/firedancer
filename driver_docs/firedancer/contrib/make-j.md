A Bash script for executing parallel make with CPU isolation considerations.

# Purpose
The script is a Bash script designed to optimize the execution of the `make` command on systems with CPU isolation. It first checks if any CPUs are isolated by reading from `/sys/devices/system/cpu/isolated`. If no CPUs are isolated, it executes a normal parallel `make` using `make -j -Otarget`. If CPUs are isolated, the script uses `chrt` and `taskset` to ensure that the `make` command runs on the isolated CPUs, which are typically more numerous. This approach addresses the limitations of `taskset` and the default kernel scheduling policy, which may not handle isolated and non-isolated cores effectively. The script calculates the number of available cores using `nproc --all` and `nproc` to determine the correct number of jobs for `make`, ensuring efficient use of CPU resources.
