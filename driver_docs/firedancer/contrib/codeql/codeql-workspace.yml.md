Configures CodeQL to reference nightly queries from local files instead of the default registry.

# Purpose
The file configures the CodeQL CLI to reference specific query packs from the local file system instead of the default registry. It specifies three query packs: `test/qlpack.yml`, `dev/qlpack.yml`, and `nightly/qlpack.yml` under the `provide` section. Additionally, it defines a registry with the `packages` field set to `codeql/*` and the `url` pointing to `https://ghcr.io/v2/`, indicating where to find the packages.
