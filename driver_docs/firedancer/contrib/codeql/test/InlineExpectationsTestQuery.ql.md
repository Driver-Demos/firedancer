Defines a test post-processing module for inline expectations in CodeQL queries.

# Purpose
This code is a test module for post-processing operations in a CodeQL environment. It imports necessary components from the CodeQL library, specifically for inline expectations testing. The module defines an `Input` implementation that adheres to the `T::TestPostProcessing::InputSig<Impl>` signature. The `getRelativeUrl` function within the `Input` module constructs a relative URL string from a given `Location` object by extracting file and line information. This functionality is used to verify the correctness of code analysis results by comparing expected and actual outcomes in a structured format.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `cpp`
- `codeql.util.test.InlineExpectationsTest`
- `utils.test.internal.InlineExpectationsTestImpl`
- `T::TestPostProcessing`
- `T::TestPostProcessing::Make`


# Functions

---
### getRelativeUrl
Generates a relative URL string for a given `Location` object based on its file and position information.
- **Inputs**:
    - `location`: A `Location` object that contains information about a file and its position.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Checks if there exists a `File` object `f` and integer values `startline`, `startcolumn`, `endline`, and `endcolumn` such that the `location` has location information matching these values.
    - Retrieves the file associated with the `location` using `location.getFile()`.
    - If the conditions are met, constructs a string `result` by concatenating the relative path of the file and the start and end line and column numbers, separated by colons.
- **Output**: A string representing the relative URL, which includes the file's relative path and the start and end line and column numbers.
