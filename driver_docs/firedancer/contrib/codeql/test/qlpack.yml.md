Configuration for CodeQL tests with dependencies on `fd-nightly-queries` and `cpp-all`.

# Purpose
This configuration file specifies metadata for a software package. It defines the package name as `asymmetric-research/fd-nightly-queries-tests` and sets the version to `0.0.0`. The file lists dependencies, including `asymmetric-research/fd-nightly-queries` and `codeql/cpp-all`, both with version constraints set to any version (`"*"`). The `extractor` is set to `cpp`, indicating the use of a C++ extractor. The `warnOnImplicitThis` option is enabled, which will generate warnings for implicit `this` usage. The `tests` field points to the current directory (`.`) for test files.
