Expected output for array access issues in `MetricsEnumAccess.c`, highlighting mismatches and potential errors.

# Purpose
The content documents potential issues related to array access in the `MetricsEnumAccess.c` file. It identifies specific lines of code where the index (`IDX`) and count (`CNT`) values used in macros do not align with the actual array sizes, which could lead to under-reads, over-reads, under-writes, or over-writes. Each entry specifies the exact location in the code, the type of access issue, and a description of the mismatch between the expected and actual values. This information is crucial for developers to identify and correct array access errors, ensuring that the code operates safely and as intended.
