References a query and postprocess script for testing non-binary function detection.

# Purpose
The file specifies a query configuration for a software analysis tool. It sets the `query` to `NonBinaryIsFunction.ql`, which likely defines a specific query to be executed. The `postprocess` is set to `InlineExpectationsTestQuery.ql`, indicating that after the main query runs, a post-processing step will occur using the specified script to handle or verify the results.
