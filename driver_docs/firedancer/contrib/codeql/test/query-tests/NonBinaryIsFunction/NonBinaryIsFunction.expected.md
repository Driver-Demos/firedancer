Expected output for tests on functions named like `is` functions but returning non-binary values.

# Purpose
This metadata file documents specific functions in the `NonBinaryIsFunction.c` source file that are named like `is` functions but return non-binary values. Each entry includes the location of the return statement, a description of the function's behavior, and the bounds of the return value. The functions `fd_instr_acc_is_signer_idx` and `fd_banks_is_bank_dead` are highlighted, with their respective return value bounds of `[-33, -33]` and `[0, 8]`. This information is useful for understanding the behavior and constraints of these functions within the codebase.
