Tests for detecting trivial `memcpy` operations and potential strict aliasing violations.

# Purpose
The code is a C source file that demonstrates the use of memory copy operations with different data structures. It includes type definitions for various data types such as `uchar`, `ushort`, `uint`, and `ulong`, as well as structures like `fd_txn_p`, `foo`, and `with_array`. The code defines a custom memory copy function [`fd_memcpy`](<#fd_memcpy>) and uses the standard [`memcpy`](<#memcpy>) and `__builtin_memcpy` functions to perform memory operations. The main function contains examples of copying data between instances of these structures, highlighting scenarios where alerts are generated due to potential issues with memory operations, such as strict aliasing violations or incorrect size calculations.

The file also defines a union `fd_hash` that allows interchangeable use of hash and key arrays, and provides type-specific accessors for different data types. The code includes examples of copying data between instances of `fd_hash_t` and `fd_txn_p_t` without generating alerts, indicating these operations are considered safe. The main function serves as a test suite to illustrate the behavior of memory copy operations in various contexts, including handling arrays and pointer types. The comments in the code provide context for the alerts and false positives, referencing discussions and examples from external sources.
# Data Structures

---
### fd\_txn\_p
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Description**: Defines a structure `fd_txn_p` which is used as a type definition `fd_txn_p_t`. The structure does not have any fields specified, indicating it may serve as a placeholder or marker type in the code.


---
### fd\_txn\_p\_t
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Description**: Defines a type alias `fd_txn_p_t` for the `struct fd_txn_p`, which is an empty structure with no fields.


---
### fd\_hash
- **Type**: `union`
- **Members**:
    - `hash`: An array of unsigned characters with a size defined by `FD_HASH_FOOTPRINT`.
    - `key`: An array of unsigned characters with a size defined by `FD_HASH_FOOTPRINT`, interchangeable with `fd_pubkey`.
    - `ul`: An array of unsigned long integers with a size determined by dividing `FD_HASH_FOOTPRINT` by the size of `ulong`.
    - `ui`: An array of unsigned integers with a size determined by dividing `FD_HASH_FOOTPRINT` by the size of `uint`.
    - `uc`: An array of unsigned characters with a size defined by `FD_HASH_FOOTPRINT`.
- **Description**: The `fd_hash` union is a packed data structure that provides multiple views of a hash or key, allowing access as an array of unsigned characters, unsigned long integers, or unsigned integers. This design facilitates the interchangeability of `fd_hash` and `fd_pubkey`, and supports different type-specific access patterns for the same underlying data footprint.


---
### fd\_hash\_t
- **Type**: `union`
- **Members**:
    - ``hash``: An array of unsigned characters with a size defined by `FD_HASH_FOOTPRINT`.
    - ``key``: An array of unsigned characters with a size defined by `FD_HASH_FOOTPRINT`, interchangeable with `hash`.
    - ``ul``: An array of unsigned long integers with a size calculated as `FD_HASH_FOOTPRINT / sizeof(ulong)`.
    - ``ui``: An array of unsigned integers with a size calculated as `FD_HASH_FOOTPRINT / sizeof(uint)`.
    - ``uc``: An array of unsigned characters with a size defined by `FD_HASH_FOOTPRINT`.
- **Description**: Defines a packed union that can store a hash or public key as an array of bytes, and provides multiple ways to access the data as different types, such as arrays of unsigned long integers, unsigned integers, or unsigned characters.


---
### fd\_pubkey\_t
- **Type**: `union`
- **Members**:
    - `hash`: An array of unsigned characters with a size defined by `FD_HASH_FOOTPRINT`.
    - `key`: An array of unsigned characters with a size defined by `FD_HASH_FOOTPRINT`, interchangeable with `hash`.
    - `ul`: An array of unsigned long integers with a size calculated by dividing `FD_HASH_FOOTPRINT` by the size of an unsigned long.
    - `ui`: An array of unsigned integers with a size calculated by dividing `FD_HASH_FOOTPRINT` by the size of an unsigned int.
    - `uc`: An array of unsigned characters with a size defined by `FD_HASH_FOOTPRINT`.
- **Description**: Defines a union that can store a public key or hash, represented as arrays of different types, allowing interchangeable use of `hash` and `key` fields.


---
### foo
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - ``a``: An integer field.
    - ``b``: A long integer field.
- **Description**: Defines a simple structure with two fields: an integer `a` and a long integer `b`. This structure is used to create a type `foo_t` through a typedef, allowing for easy instantiation and manipulation of objects of this type.


---
### foo\_t
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `a`: An integer field.
    - `b`: A long integer field.
- **Description**: Defines a simple structure with two fields: an integer `a` and a long integer `b`. This structure can be used to store and manipulate a pair of integer values.


---
### with\_array
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - ``array``: An array of four integers.
    - ``b``: A long integer.
- **Description**: Defines a structure with an integer array of size four and a long integer, providing a simple compound data type for storing these values together.


---
### with\_array\_t
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - ``array``: An array of 4 integers.
    - ``b``: A long integer.
- **Description**: Defines a structure with an integer array of size 4 and a long integer, used to store and manipulate a fixed-size collection of integers along with an additional long integer value.


# Functions

---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../../../contrib/codeql/test/query-tests/TrivialMemcpy/TrivialMemcpy.c#L53>)

Demonstrates various uses of `memcpy`, `fd_memcpy`, and `__builtin_memcpy` functions with different data structures and highlights potential alerts and false positives.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments.
    - `argv`: An array of strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Declare variables of types `foo_t`, `with_array_t`, `fd_txn_p_t`, and `fd_hash_t`.
    - Use `memcpy`, `fd_memcpy`, and `__builtin_memcpy` to copy data between variables of the same type, generating alerts for potential issues.
    - Perform memory copy operations on arrays within structures, noting when alerts are not generated.
    - Demonstrate a strict aliasing false positive example with `foo_t` and a character buffer.
    - Show examples with `fd_txn_p_t` and `fd_hash_t` where no alerts are generated.
- **Output**: No return value as the function is of type `int` but does not return a value.
