Expected output for refactoring calls to memcpy, fd_memcpy, and __builtin_memcpy as assignments.

# Purpose
The content provides a list of code analysis results for the file `TrivialMemcpy.c`, identifying specific lines where calls to memory copy functions can be optimized. Each entry specifies the line numbers and the function call, such as `memcpy`, `fd_memcpy`, or `__builtin_memcpy`, and suggests that these calls could be replaced with direct assignments. The analysis aims to improve code efficiency by recommending simpler operations where possible. The entries are organized by line number and include a note indicating the context or variable, such as `foo` or `with_array`, where the optimization can be applied. This information is useful for developers looking to enhance performance by reducing unnecessary function calls.
