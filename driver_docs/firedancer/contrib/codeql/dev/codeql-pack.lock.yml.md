Specifies dependencies and their versions for a CodeQL pack.

# Purpose
The YAML configuration file specifies the dependencies and their respective versions for a project using CodeQL libraries. Each dependency is listed under the `dependencies` key, with its name and version number. The `lockVersion` key indicates the version of the lock file format, ensuring compatibility with the tools that read it. The `compiled` key, set to `false`, indicates that the dependencies have not been compiled yet. This file helps manage and maintain consistent versions of dependencies across different environments.
