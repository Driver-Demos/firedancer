Detects missing free calls before pool acquire calls in `fd_pool.c`, issuing warnings for potential issues.

# Purpose
The code is a static analysis tool designed to detect potential issues in C or C++ code related to resource management, specifically focusing on memory pool operations. It identifies calls to pool acquire functions that are not preceded by a corresponding free function call on all execution paths within a function. This is important for ensuring that resources are properly released, preventing memory leaks.

The code defines two classes, `PoolAcquire` and `PoolFree`, both of which extend the `FunctionCall` class. The `PoolAcquire` class identifies function calls that match the pattern for acquiring resources from a pool, specifically those ending in `_idx_acquire` or `_ele_acquire`, and located in the `fd_pool.c` file. The `PoolFree` class identifies function calls that match the pattern for freeing resources, specifically those ending in `_free` or `_used`, also located in the `fd_pool.c` file. Both classes provide a method `getPoolName` to extract the pool name from the function call.

The analysis logic uses these classes to find instances where a `PoolAcquire` call is not dominated by a corresponding `PoolFree` call with the same pool name, indicating a potential issue. The analysis excludes files located in a `tmpl` directory and the `fd_types.c` file. The tool outputs a warning for each detected issue, along with the name of the pool involved.

# Data Structures

---
### PoolAcquire
- **Type**: ``class``
- **Members**:
    - ``PoolAcquire``: Represents a function call to pool acquire functions that are not preceded by a corresponding free function call.
    - ``getPoolName``: Returns the name of the pool by removing specific suffixes from the target function name.
- **Description**: Represents a class that extends `FunctionCall` to detect calls to pool acquire functions in the `fd_pool.c` file, ensuring they are not preceded by a corresponding free function call on all paths. It includes a method to extract the pool name by removing specific suffixes from the function name.


---
### PoolFree
- **Type**: ``class``
- **Members**:
    - ``PoolFree``: Represents a function call that matches specific naming patterns related to freeing resources in a pool.
    - ``PoolFree()``: Constructor that initializes the `PoolFree` object by checking if the target function name matches specific patterns and file conditions.
    - ``getPoolName``: Returns the pool name by removing specific suffixes from the target function name.
- **Description**: Represents a function call that is related to freeing resources in a pool, specifically targeting functions with names that match the patterns `%_free` or `%_used` in the file `fd_pool.c`, excluding paths that match `%/tmpl/%`. It provides a method to extract the pool name by removing the `_free` or `_used` suffix from the function name.
