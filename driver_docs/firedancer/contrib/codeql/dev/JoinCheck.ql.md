A CodeQL query that checks for suspicious `fd_*_join` calls with mismatched argument types.

# Purpose
The code is a query script designed to identify potential issues in C++ code related to the use of `fd_*_join` functions. It specifically checks for calls to these functions where the argument type does not match the expected type. The script is intended to enhance security and correctness by flagging mismatches as warnings.

The script defines a class `FdJoinCall` that extends `Call`. This class identifies calls to functions with names matching the pattern `fd_%_join`. It checks if the first parameter is a pointer to a `VoidType` and ensures that the return type is not `VoidType`. The script also defines a predicate `isCompatible` to compare the base types of derived types, ensuring they match.

Additionally, the script includes a class `RelevantType` that extends `Type`. This class filters out types that are `VoidType`, `CharType`, or `IntegralType`, focusing on more complex types. The main query uses these components to select calls where the argument type is incompatible with the expected parameter type, highlighting these discrepancies for further review.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `cpp`


# Data Structures

---
### FdJoinCall
- **Type**: ``class``
- **Members**:
    - ``FdJoinCall``: A constructor that checks if the target function name matches `fd_%_join` and verifies type compatibility.
- **Description**: Represents a specialized call that checks for suspicious joins in C++ code by ensuring that the argument type matches the expected type for functions named `fd_*_join`. It extends the `Call` class and includes logic to verify that the first parameter is a pointer to a `VoidType` and that the call's return type is not `VoidType`.


---
### RelevantType
- **Type**: ``class``
- **Members**:
    - ``RelevantType``: Represents a type that is not a `VoidType`, `CharType`, or `IntegralType`.
- **Description**: Represents a type that excludes `VoidType`, `CharType`, and `IntegralType`, ensuring that the base type of a `DerivedType` is not one of these excluded types.
