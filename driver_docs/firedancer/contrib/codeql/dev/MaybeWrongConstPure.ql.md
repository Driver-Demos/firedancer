Checks for calls to non-const/non-pure functions from functions marked as const or pure in C++ code.

# Purpose
The code defines a mechanism to check for calls to non-const or non-pure functions from functions that are marked as const or pure. It is implemented as a set of classes and functions that analyze the relationships between different types of functions in a codebase. The primary focus is to identify and warn about potential issues where a function, expected to be const or pure, calls another function that does not adhere to these constraints.

The code includes abstract classes `RFunc` and `ShouldBeFunc`, which extend a base `Function` class. The `PureFunc` and `ConstFunc` classes inherit from `RFunc` and represent functions that are explicitly marked as pure or const, respectively. The `ShouldBePure` class extends `ShouldBeFunc` and is used to identify functions that should be pure but may call non-pure functions. It checks if a function is called by another function and verifies the file path to ensure it matches a specific pattern.

The function `directOrNot` determines the relationship between functions, indicating whether a function is a const/pure function or is called by one. The code uses a query to select functions that are called in a manner inconsistent with their const/pure designation, generating a warning message. This code is likely part of a static analysis tool that helps developers maintain code quality by enforcing const/pure function constraints.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `cpp`


# Data Structures

---
### RFunc
- **Type**: ``abstract class``
- **Members**:
    - ``PureFunc``: Represents a function that is marked as pure.
    - ``ConstFunc``: Represents a function that is marked as const.
- **Description**: Represents an abstract class that extends the `Function` class and serves as a base for classes that represent functions marked as const or pure.


---
### PureFunc
- **Type**: ``class``
- **Members**:
    - ``PureFunc``: Constructor that sets the attribute name to 'pure'.
- **Description**: Extends the `RFunc` class and represents a function that is marked as pure by setting its attribute name to 'pure'.


---
### ConstFunc
- **Type**: ``class``
- **Members**:
    - ``ConstFunc``: Constructor that sets the attribute name to 'const'.
- **Description**: Represents a class that extends `RFunc` and is used to identify functions marked as 'const' by setting an attribute name to 'const' during its construction.


---
### ShouldBeFunc
- **Type**: ``abstract class``
- **Members**:
    - ``off``: A `Function` object that is used in the `ShouldBePure` class.
- **Description**: Represents an abstract class that extends `Function` and serves as a base for classes that should be pure or const functions. It is part of a system that checks for non-const or non-pure functions being called by functions marked as const or pure. The `ShouldBeFunc` class is extended by `ShouldBePure`, which includes logic to determine if a function is improperly calling non-const or non-pure functions.


---
### ShouldBePure
- **Type**: ``class``
- **Members**:
    - ``off``: A `Function` object that the `ShouldBePure` class uses to determine if it is called by a const or pure function.
- **Description**: Represents a class that checks if a function, which should be pure, is being called by another function that is either a const or pure function. The `ShouldBePure` class contains a `Function` member `off` and uses it to verify the calling function's type. The constructor ensures that the function is not an instance of `RFunc`, and it checks the file path to match a specific pattern. The `getOff` method returns the `off` function.


# Functions

---
### directOrNot
Determines if a function is a direct instance of `RFunc` or is called by a `ShouldBeFunc`.
- **Inputs**:
    - `off`: A `Function` object to check against `RFunc` and `ShouldBeFunc` classes.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Check if `off` is an instance of `RFunc`.
    - If `off` is an instance of `RFunc`, set `result` to "is".
    - If `off` is not an instance of `RFunc`, check if it is an instance of `ShouldBeFunc`.
    - If `off` is an instance of `ShouldBeFunc`, set `result` to "is called by a".
- **Output**: A string indicating whether the function is a direct instance of `RFunc` ("is") or is called by a `ShouldBeFunc` ("is called by a").
