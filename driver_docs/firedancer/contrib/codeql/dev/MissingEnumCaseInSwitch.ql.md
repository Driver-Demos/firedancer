Detects switch statements over enum types that lack cases for some enum constants and have no default case.

# Purpose
This code defines a query to identify potential issues in C++ code where a switch statement over an enum type is missing a case for some enum constants and does not include a default case. The absence of these cases can lead to logic errors, as not all possible enum values are handled. The query is categorized as a problem with a severity level of "warning" and a precision level of "medium". It is tagged with reliability, correctness, and an external reference to CWE-478, which relates to missing default cases in switch statements.

The query uses the `cpp` and `filter` modules to analyze C++ code. It specifically looks for instances of `EnumSwitch` where there is no default case and calculates the proportion of missing cases relative to the total number of cases. If the proportion of missing cases is less than 30%, the query identifies this as a potential issue. The query then selects the switch statement and the missing enum case, providing a message that indicates the switch statement does not have a case for a specific enum constant.

This code is intended to be part of a static analysis tool that helps developers identify and correct potential logic errors in their C++ code. It does not define public APIs or external interfaces but rather serves as an internal mechanism to enhance code reliability and correctness by flagging incomplete switch statements.
