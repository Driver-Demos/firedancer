Identifies dead code following a terminating log function call in C++ code.

# Purpose
This code is a static analysis rule written in QL, a query language used for code analysis. The purpose of this rule is to identify and flag instances of dead code that occur after a terminating log function call, specifically `fd_log_private_2`, in C++ codebases. The rule is categorized as a problem with a warning severity level and is part of the `asymmetric-research/dead-code-after-terminating-log` identifier.

The code defines two main classes: `TerminatingLog` and `UnreachableBlock`. The `TerminatingLog` class extends `FunctionCall` and identifies function calls to `fd_log_private_2`, which is assumed to terminate the program. The `UnreachableBlock` class extends `BasicBlock` and identifies blocks of code that are unreachable. The rule uses predicates such as `isProperBlock` and `isAbove` to determine the characteristics of the basic blocks and their positions relative to the terminating log call.

The main logic of the rule is in the `from` clause, which selects unreachable blocks (`UnreachableBlock`) that occur after a terminating log call (`TerminatingLog`) within the same function. The rule ensures that the terminating log call is reachable and that the unreachable block is not trivial or empty. If these conditions are met, the rule flags the unreachable block as dead code, providing a message that includes the length of the dead code block. This helps developers identify and remove unnecessary code that will never be executed due to the terminating nature of the log call.

# Data Structures

---
### TerminatingLog
- **Type**: `class`
- **Members**:
    - ``TerminatingLog``: Extends the `FunctionCall` class and represents a function call to `fd_log_private_2`.
- **Description**: Represents a function call that is considered a terminating log, specifically targeting the function `fd_log_private_2`.


---
### UnreachableBlock
- **Type**: ``class``
- **Members**:
    - ``UnreachableBlock``: Extends the `BasicBlock` class and represents a block of code that is unreachable.
- **Description**: Represents a block of code that is unreachable within a control flow graph, extending the `BasicBlock` class to identify such blocks.
