Configuration for a CodeQL query pack with C++ extractor and specific dependencies.

# Purpose
The file defines metadata for a software package. It specifies the package name as `asymmetric-research/fd-dev-queries` and the version as `0.0.1`. The `extractor` field indicates that the package uses the `cpp` extractor. The `warnOnImplicitThis` field is set to `true`, which enables warnings for implicit `this` usage. The `dependencies` section lists `codeql/cpp-all` with a version constraint of `"*"`, indicating a dependency on all versions of the `codeql/cpp-all` package.
