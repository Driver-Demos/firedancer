Detects instances where a function's error code return value is discarded without handling.

# Purpose
This code defines a static analysis rule to identify instances where a function that returns an error code is called, but the return value is not used. The purpose of this rule is to detect potential issues in code where error handling might be neglected, which can lead to unhandled errors and unexpected behavior in software applications.

The code uses a class `ErrFunction` that extends a `Function` class. The `ErrFunction` class is designed to identify functions that have a constant return type, which is typically used to return error codes. The logic then checks for function calls (`FunctionCall`) where the return value is not assigned, returned, or otherwise used in a statement (`Stmt`). It excludes certain types of statements such as `ReturnStmt`, `Assignment`, `DeclStmt`, `Loop`, `ConditionalStmt`, and macro expansions. Additionally, it filters out calls within files that match a specific naming pattern, such as test or fuzz files, to avoid false positives in test code.

The code is part of a static analysis tool and is intended to be used as a rule or check within a larger framework. It does not define a public API or external interface but rather contributes to the internal logic of a static analysis system. The rule is categorized as a problem with a warning severity and low precision, indicating that while it may not always indicate a definite issue, it highlights areas of code that warrant further inspection.
