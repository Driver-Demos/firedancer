Detects implicit conversions from `void*` to typed pointers in C++ code, recommending against it.

# Purpose
The code defines a mechanism to identify and report instances of implicit conversion from a `void*` pointer to a typed pointer in C++ code. This is achieved by implementing a set of classes and predicates that analyze the types involved in assignments and determine if such conversions occur. The primary focus is on ensuring type safety by recommending against implicit promotions that can lead to potential issues in type handling.

The `VoidPointer` class extends `PointerType` and is used to identify pointers of type `void*`. The `implicitVoidPromotion` predicate checks if an assignment involves converting a `void*` to a non-`void*` type, which is not allowed unless explicitly converted. The `BroadAssign` class is used to represent assignment operations and provides methods to retrieve the types of the left-hand side and right-hand side expressions involved in the assignment.

The code also includes a filter to exclude certain files, such as `fd_types.c`, from this analysis using the `allowedSourceFile` predicate. The selection criteria ensure that the analysis only considers assignments that are not part of macro expansions, do not have explicit conversions, and do not involve specific function calls like `fd_type_pun%`. The result is a recommendation message that highlights the implicit conversion, aiding developers in maintaining type safety in their code.

# Data Structures

### VoidPointer
- **Type**: ``class``
- **Members**:
    - ``VoidPointer``: Represents a pointer type that implicitly converts from a `void*` to a typed pointer.
- **Description**: The `VoidPointer` class extends the `PointerType` class and represents a pointer type that allows implicit conversion from a `void*` to a typed pointer. This class checks if the base type is unspecified and is an instance of `VoidType`. It is used in conjunction with predicates like `implicitVoidPromotion` to identify and handle implicit conversions in code, ensuring that such conversions are only allowed in specific source files and under certain conditions.


---
### BroadAssign
- **Type**: ``class``
- **Members**:
    - ``getRExpr``: Gets the right-hand side expression of the assignment or variable initializer.
    - ``getLType``: Gets the type of the left-hand side of the assignment or variable.
    - ``getRType``: Gets the type of the right-hand side expression.
- **Description**: Represents an assignment or variable that can be located in code, and provides methods to access the right-hand side expression and the types of both sides of the assignment.
