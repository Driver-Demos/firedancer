Detects and warns about calls to alloca within loops to prevent stack overflows.

# Purpose
This code defines a rule for identifying problematic patterns in C++ code, specifically focusing on the use of `alloca` within loops. It is a part of a static analysis tool that flags the use of dynamic stack allocation functions like `alloca`, `fd_alloca`, `fd_alloca_check`, and `__builtin_alloca` when they are called inside loops. The code extends the `FunctionCall` class to create an `AllocaCall` class that checks if the target function matches any of the specified names. It then uses a query to find instances where these functions are called within loops and issues a warning to prevent potential stack overflows. The severity of the problem is set to "warning," and the precision of detection is high.
# Imports and Dependencies

### AllocaCall
- **Type**: ``class``
- **Members**:
    - ``AllocaCall``: Extends the `FunctionCall` class to represent a call to specific allocation functions.
- **Description**: Represents a call to allocation functions like `fd_alloca`, `alloca`, `fd_alloca_check`, or `__builtin_alloca` within a loop, which is identified as a problem due to the risk of stack overflow.
