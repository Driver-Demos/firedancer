Detects incorrect overflow checks in integer addition that can lead to reliability and security issues.

# Purpose
This code is a static analysis rule definition for identifying a specific problem in C++ code related to integer addition overflow. The rule checks for incorrect methods of detecting overflow in integer addition operations. Specifically, it identifies cases where the result of an addition is compared against one of the operands to check for overflow, which is ineffective when the result is automatically promoted to a larger data type.

The code imports necessary modules such as `cpp`, `BadAdditionOverflowCheck`, and `filter` to facilitate the analysis. It uses a query to find instances of relational operations (`RelationalOperation cmp`) and addition expressions (`AddExpr a`) that match the criteria defined by the `badAdditionOverflowCheck` function. The query further filters these instances to include only those located in the specified source code files. The results of the query are then selected, providing the location and file path of the problematic code.

This rule is tagged with several attributes indicating its importance and relevance, such as `reliability`, `correctness`, and `security`. It is associated with external Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) identifiers `cwe-190` and `cwe-192`, which relate to integer overflow and type conversion issues. The rule is marked with a high severity level, indicating its critical nature in ensuring code reliability and security.
