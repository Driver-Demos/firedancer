Detects tile union type confusion in C++ code by identifying mismatches between tile union members and their source files.

# Purpose
The code defines a problem detection mechanism for identifying type confusion issues in tile union members within C++ source files. It is implemented using a query language, likely CodeQL, to analyze codebases for specific patterns that indicate potential bugs. The primary focus is on detecting instances where a tile union member is accessed in a source file that does not correspond to the union member type, which is flagged as a warning with medium precision.

The code consists of two main classes: `TileUnionVariant` and `TileAccessInTile`. The `TileUnionVariant` class extends `Declaration` and is used to identify unnamed unions that are missing information in the CodeQL database. It specifically looks for union members named "shred" in files with the base name "fd_topo.h". The `TileAccessInTile` class extends `FieldAccess` and identifies field accesses in files with names matching the pattern "%_tile.%", where the target is an instance of `TileUnionVariant`.

The query at the end of the code selects instances of `TileAccessInTile` where the file name does not match a specific pattern related to the tile name, excluding certain cases such as "net" inheritance and a specific backtest case named "archiver" in "fd_backtest_tile.c". This selection process helps in pinpointing the exact locations in the codebase where the type confusion issue might occur, allowing developers to address these potential bugs.
# Imports and Dependencies

- `cpp`


# Data Structures

### TileUnionVariant
- **Type**: ``class``
- **Members**:
    - ``TileUnionVariant``: Represents a variant of a tile union that extends the `Declaration` class.
- **Description**: Represents a variant of a tile union that extends the `Declaration` class. The constructor checks for the existence of a union member named `shred` in a file named `fd_topo.h`. This class is part of a mechanism to identify potential type confusion issues in tile union members accessed in incorrect source files.


---
### TileAccessInTile
- **Type**: ``class``
- **Members**:
    - ``TileAccessInTile``: Represents a field access within a tile source file that matches a specific pattern and targets a `TileUnionVariant`.
- **Description**: `TileAccessInTile` is a class that extends `FieldAccess` and is used to identify field accesses in tile source files that match a specific naming pattern and target a `TileUnionVariant`. It checks if the file name of the location matches a pattern indicative of tile files and ensures that the target is an instance of `TileUnionVariant`. This class is part of a mechanism to detect potential issues with tile union type confusion in source files.
