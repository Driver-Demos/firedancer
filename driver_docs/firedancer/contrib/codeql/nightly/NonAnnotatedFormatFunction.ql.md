Detects calls to functions that likely expect a format string but lack a format annotation.

# Purpose
This code is a query written for a static analysis tool that examines C++ source files. It identifies function calls that likely expect a format string but are not annotated with a "format" attribute. The query searches for string literals containing format specifiers and checks if they are passed to functions without the "format" attribute. It only considers functions defined in files within the "src/" directory and excludes dynamic function calls. If such a function is found, the code generates a warning indicating a potential issue with the function's format string handling.
