Detects missing end calls for bank locking operations on divergent return paths in C++ code.

# Purpose
This code is a problem detection script that identifies paths in a codebase where a locking operation is terminated on one return path but not on another. It is intended to be used as part of a static analysis tool, likely within a larger framework for code quality checks. The script imports modules `cpp` and `filter`, and defines predicates and functions to analyze function calls related to locking operations, specifically those with names starting with `fd_bank_` and ending with `_end_locking_modify` or `_end_locking_query`. The script uses control flow analysis to find paths that do not properly end a locking operation, and it generates warnings for these paths. The code is not an executable or a library but a specialized script for identifying specific code issues related to locking mechanisms.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `cpp`
- `filter`


# Functions

---
### end
Finds paths in code where a locking operation ends on one return path but not on another, indicating a potential issue.
- **Inputs**:
    - `u`: A `FunctionCall` object representing a function call to check if it matches the end locking pattern.
    - `base`: A `string` representing the base name used to construct the function name patterns to check against.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Checks if the function call `u` targets a function with a name that matches either `fd_bank_<base>_end_locking_modify` or `fd_bank_<base>_end_locking_query`.
    - Uses logical OR to determine if either of the name patterns match.
    - Returns a boolean result indicating if the function call matches the end locking pattern.
- **Output**: A boolean value indicating whether the function call `u` matches the specified end locking function name patterns.


---
### capTarget
Extracts and returns a specific substring from the name of a function call target.
- **Inputs**:
    - ``f``: A `FunctionCall` object from which the function extracts the target name.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Call `f.getTarget().getName()` to get the name of the function call target.
    - Use `regexpCapture` on the target name with the regular expression `"fd_bank_((?!.*(?:^|_)end(?:_|$)).+?)_locking_.*"` to extract a specific substring.
    - Assign the result of the `regexpCapture` to `result`.
- **Output**: A `string` that contains the extracted substring from the function call target's name.


---
### genAll
Finds and returns a string that matches a specific pattern in the names of function calls.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Uses the `exists` construct to iterate over `FunctionCall` objects `f`.
    - Calls the `capTarget` function with each `FunctionCall` object `f`.
    - Assigns the result of `capTarget(f)` to `result`.
    - Returns the `result` if the `exists` condition is satisfied.
- **Output**: A string that matches the pattern defined in the `capTarget` function.


---
### nextNoUnlock
Finds the next control flow node that does not have an unlocking operation for a given base string.
- **Inputs**:
    - `n`: A `ControlFlowNode` object representing the current node in the control flow graph.
    - `base`: A `string` representing the base name used to identify specific function calls related to locking operations.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Set `base` to the result of `genAll()` which generates all possible base strings.
    - Check if there does not exist a `FunctionCall` `u` such that `end(u, base)` is true and `n` equals `u`.
    - If the above condition is true, set `result` to the successor of `n` if it is a `ReturnStmt`.
    - If the successor is not a `ReturnStmt`, recursively call `nextNoUnlock` with the successor of `n` and `base`.
- **Output**: A `ControlFlowNode` that is the next node in the control flow graph without an unlocking operation for the given base.
