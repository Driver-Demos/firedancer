Detects misleading NULL checks on non-first field addresses in C++ code, issuing a warning.

# Purpose
This code defines a static analysis rule for identifying a specific type of dubious NULL check in C++ code. The rule is designed to detect cases where the address of a field, except the first field in a structure, is checked against NULL. Such checks are misleading because the address of a field, other than the first, will not be NULL unless the base address is manipulated in a specific way. The rule is categorized as a problem with a severity level of "warning" and a precision level of "very-high," indicating that it is a reliable indicator of potential issues in the code.

The code uses predicates to define conditions under which a NULL check is considered dubious. The `zeroComparison` predicate identifies equality operations where one operand is zero. The `inNullContext` predicate checks if an `AddressOfExpr` is used in a context where it is compared to zero or used in a control structure. The `chainedFields` function recursively identifies field accesses that are part of a chain of field accesses. The main logic of the rule is implemented in a query that selects expressions meeting specific conditions, such as being in a NULL context and having a non-zero offset from the base variable.

The rule is implemented using a domain-specific language for static analysis, likely intended to be part of a larger code analysis tool. It imports modules `cpp` and `filter`, which suggests it leverages existing functionality for parsing and analyzing C++ code. The rule is tagged with "reliability" and "readability," indicating its focus on improving code quality by identifying misleading or incorrect NULL checks.
