Excludes specific code from analysis based on file path prefixes.

# Purpose
The code defines a predicate function `included` that determines if a given file location should be included for analysis. It imports a module named `cpp`, which suggests that the code is related to C++ source files. The predicate checks if the relative path of a file location starts with the prefix "src/", indicating that only files within the "src" directory are included for further processing. This code is likely part of a larger system that filters files for analysis, excluding those that do not meet the specified criteria.
