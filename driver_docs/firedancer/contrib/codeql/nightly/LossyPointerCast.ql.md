Detects lossy pointer casts where a pointer type is converted to a smaller integer type, potentially causing data loss.

# Purpose
This code defines a static analysis rule for identifying lossy pointer casts in C++ code. A lossy pointer cast occurs when a pointer type is converted to a smaller integer type, which can result in the loss of information and is considered non-portable. The rule is categorized as a problem with a severity level of "warning" and a high precision level. It is tagged with "reliability," "correctness," and "types," indicating its focus on ensuring code reliability and correctness by addressing type-related issues.

The main technical component is the `lossyPointerCast` predicate, which checks if an expression `e` involves a conversion from a pointer type `pt` to an integral type `it` that is smaller in size. The predicate ensures that the integral type is not a boolean, the conversion is not part of a macro expansion, and the expression is not used in a bitwise AND operation, which might indicate intentional use of low bits for flags. The `from` clause specifies the conditions under which the `lossyPointerCast` predicate is applied, and the `select` statement generates a warning message for each identified instance, detailing the conversion from the pointer type to the smaller integral type.

This code is part of a static analysis tool, likely intended to be used as a library or plugin that can be imported into a larger analysis framework. It does not define a public API but provides a specific rule for detecting a common issue in C++ codebases, contributing to the overall goal of improving code quality and portability.
