Detects functions that return pointers to stack-allocated memory, which can cause dangling pointer issues.

# Purpose
The code defines a configuration for detecting potential issues related to returning stack-allocated memory in C++ programs. It is part of a static analysis tool that identifies when a function returns a pointer to memory allocated on the stack, which can lead to dereferencing a dangling pointer. This is a common reliability and security issue, as indicated by the tags and severity levels in the comments.

The main component of the code is the `ReturnStackAllocatedMemoryConfig` class, which extends the `MustFlowConfiguration` class. This class defines several predicates to identify sources and sinks of data flow that involve stack-allocated memory. The `isSource` predicate identifies instructions that use stack variables or call functions known to return stack-allocated memory. The `isSink` predicate identifies instructions that store values in a way that they might be returned from a function. The configuration also includes logic to handle specific cases, such as conflating addresses of fields with their objects, to improve detection accuracy.

The code uses several imports from the `semmle.code.cpp.ir` package, which suggests it is part of a larger framework for analyzing C++ intermediate representations. The configuration is used to detect paths where stack-allocated memory might be returned, and it selects these paths for reporting with a warning message. This functionality is crucial for identifying potential vulnerabilities in C++ codebases.

# Data Structures

---
### ReturnStackAllocatedMemoryConfig
- **Type**: ``class``
- **Members**:
    - ``ReturnStackAllocatedMemoryConfig``: Extends the `MustFlowConfiguration` class to define a configuration for detecting stack-allocated memory return issues.
    - ``intentionallyReturnsStackPointer``: Predicate that checks if a function name suggests it intentionally returns a stack pointer.
    - ``isSource``: Predicate that identifies instructions using stack variables or functions returning stack-allocated memory.
    - ``isSink``: Predicate that identifies nodes representing `StoreInstruction` used in `ReturnValueInstruction`.
    - ``allowInterproceduralFlow``: Predicate that disables flow into callables to avoid false positives.
    - ``isAdditionalFlowStep``: Predicate that conflates addresses of fields and objects to detect address flow to return statements.
- **Description**: Defines a configuration for detecting potential issues with functions that return pointers to stack-allocated memory, which can lead to dereferencing dangling pointers. It extends the `MustFlowConfiguration` class and includes predicates to identify sources and sinks of stack-allocated memory, as well as additional flow steps to handle specific cases of address flow. The configuration also includes a predicate to disable interprocedural flow to prevent false positives.


# Functions

---
### intentionallyReturnsStackPointer
Checks if a function's name suggests it intentionally returns the stack pointer.
- **Inputs**:
    - ``f``: A `Function` object to check for intentional return of the stack pointer.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - The function `intentionallyReturnsStackPointer` takes a `Function` object `f` as input.
    - It converts the name of the function `f` to lowercase.
    - It checks if the lowercase name of the function matches patterns that include the substrings 'stack' or 'sp'.
    - If the function name matches these patterns, the predicate holds true, indicating the function may intentionally return the stack pointer.
- **Output**: A boolean value indicating whether the function name suggests it intentionally returns the stack pointer.


---
### ReturnStackAllocatedMemoryConfig
Implements a configuration to detect and analyze paths where stack-allocated memory may be returned from a function.
- **Inputs**:
    - `None`: This function does not take any direct input parameters.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Defines a class `ReturnStackAllocatedMemoryConfig` that extends `MustFlowConfiguration`.
    - Overrides the `isSource` predicate to identify instructions that use stack variables or return values from functions known to return stack-allocated memory.
    - Overrides the `isSink` predicate to identify instructions that store values in return variables.
    - Disables interprocedural flow to avoid false positives in certain code patterns.
    - Overrides `isAdditionalFlowStep` to conflate addresses of fields with their objects and pointer offsets with their base pointers.
- **Output**: The function outputs a configuration that can be used to detect paths where stack-allocated memory may be returned, potentially leading to dereferencing of dangling pointers.


---
### ReturnStackAllocatedMemoryConfig\.isSource
Determines if an instruction is a source of stack-allocated memory that may lead to a dangling pointer.
- **Inputs**:
    - ``source``: An `Instruction` object that represents a potential source of stack-allocated memory.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Check if there exists a `Function` `func` such that `func` is not associated with any extraction errors and does not intentionally return a stack pointer.
    - Verify that `func` is the enclosing function of `source`.
    - Determine if `source` is an instruction using a stack variable by checking if it is a `VariableAddressInstruction` associated with a `StackVariable` and not a `PointerToMemberType`.
    - Alternatively, check if `source` is an instruction representing the return value of a function known to return stack-allocated memory by verifying if it matches certain global names like `alloca`, `strdupa`, etc.
- **Output**: A boolean value indicating whether the `source` instruction is a source of stack-allocated memory.


---
### ReturnStackAllocatedMemoryConfig\.isSink
Determines if a given `Operand` is a sink in the context of returning stack-allocated memory.
- **Inputs**:
    - `sink`: An `Operand` that represents a potential sink in the data flow analysis.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Checks if there exists a `StoreInstruction` where the destination address is an `IRReturnVariable`.
    - Verifies that the `sink` is the source value operand of the `StoreInstruction`.
- **Output**: Returns true if the `sink` is a node representing a `StoreInstruction` used in a `ReturnValueInstruction`; otherwise, false.


---
### ReturnStackAllocatedMemoryConfig\.allowInterproceduralFlow
Disables interprocedural flow in the `ReturnStackAllocatedMemoryConfig` class.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Overrides the `allowInterproceduralFlow` predicate in the `ReturnStackAllocatedMemoryConfig` class.
    - Returns `none()` to disable interprocedural flow.
- **Output**: The function returns `none()`, indicating that interprocedural flow is not allowed.


---
### ReturnStackAllocatedMemoryConfig\.isAdditionalFlowStep
Defines additional flow steps for detecting stack-allocated memory issues in C++ code.
- **Inputs**:
    - ``node1``: An `Operand` representing the source node in the flow step.
    - ``node2``: An `Instruction` representing the destination node in the flow step.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Checks if `node2` is a `FieldAddressInstruction` and its object address operand equals `node1`.
    - Checks if `node2` is a `PointerOffsetInstruction` and its left operand equals `node1`.
- **Output**: Returns true if either of the conditions for additional flow steps are met, indicating a potential flow of stack-allocated memory.
