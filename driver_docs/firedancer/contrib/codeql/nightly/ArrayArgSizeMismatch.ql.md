Finds function calls where an array argument is smaller than the declared parameter's array size.

# Purpose
The code is a query written for a static analysis tool that identifies potential issues in C++ code related to array argument size mismatches. It specifically targets function calls where the size of an array being passed as an argument is smaller than the size of the array expected by the function's parameter. This mismatch can lead to out-of-bounds memory access, which is a common source of reliability issues in software.

The query imports necessary modules such as `cpp`, `semmle.code.cpp.commons.Buffer`, and `filter` to facilitate the analysis. It defines a set of conditions using logical expressions to identify function calls (`FunctionCall c`) where the array size of the argument (`argType`) is less than the array size of the parameter (`paramType`). The query ensures that the base types of the arrays are of the same size and filters out cases where the array size might be variable or where there are inconsistent declarations.

When a mismatch is detected, the query selects the argument in question and generates a warning message. The message specifies the size of the array being passed and the size expected by the function, providing the function's name for context. This helps developers quickly identify and address potential issues in their code, improving the reliability of the software.
