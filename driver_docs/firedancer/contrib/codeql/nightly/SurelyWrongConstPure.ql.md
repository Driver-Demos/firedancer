Checks for calls to known non-const/non-pure functions by functions marked as const or pure.

# Purpose
This code defines a query to identify functions marked as `const` or `pure` that are calling, either directly or transitively, known non-const or non-pure functions. The code is structured to work within a framework that analyzes C++ code, as indicated by the `import cpp` statement. The main components of the code are the abstract class `RFunc`, which extends `Function`, and its subclasses `PureFunc` and `ConstFunc`. These subclasses are used to represent functions that are marked with the attributes "pure" and "const", respectively.

The query logic is implemented using a combination of class definitions and a query expression. The query expression uses the `from` and `where` clauses to filter functions based on specific criteria. It checks if a function `f` has a name that matches one of the specified non-const/non-pure functions and if it is called by a function `r` that is marked as `const` or `pure`. The `select` statement then constructs a message indicating the relationship between the calling function `r` and the called function `f`, highlighting the potential issue of a `const` or `pure` function calling a non-const/non-pure function.

This code is part of a static analysis tool that generates warnings for potential issues in C++ code. The warning is of high precision and severity, as indicated by the metadata comments at the beginning of the file. The purpose of this code is to help developers identify and address violations of const-correctness and purity in their codebase, which can lead to more predictable and maintainable software.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `cpp`
- `filter`


# Data Structures

---
### RFunc
- **Type**: ``abstract class``
- **Members**:
    - ``PureFunc``: Represents a function marked as 'pure'.
    - ``ConstFunc``: Represents a function marked as 'const'.
- **Description**: Represents an abstract class that extends the `Function` class and serves as a base for functions that are either 'pure' or 'const'. The `RFunc` class is used to identify and check for non-const/non-pure functions being called by functions marked as const or pure, ensuring that such calls are flagged as warnings.


---
### PureFunc
- **Type**: ``class``
- **Members**:
    - ``PureFunc``: Constructor sets the attribute name to 'pure'.
- **Description**: Represents a class that extends `RFunc` and is used to identify functions marked as 'pure' in the context of checking for calls to non-const/non-pure functions.


---
### ConstFunc
- **Type**: ``class``
- **Members**:
    - ``ConstFunc``: Constructor that sets the attribute name to 'const'.
- **Description**: Represents a class that extends `RFunc` and is used to identify functions marked as 'const'. The `ConstFunc` class constructor sets the attribute name to 'const', indicating that the function is intended to be constant. This class is part of a system that checks for non-const or non-pure functions being called by functions marked as const or pure.
