Identifies and warns about the use of `__builtin_expect()` in non-conditional contexts in C++ code.

# Purpose
The code is a query script that identifies the use of the `__builtin_expect()` function in non-conditional contexts within C++ code. It is part of a static analysis tool that flags potential misuse of this function, which is typically used to provide the compiler with branch prediction information. The script checks if `__builtin_expect()` is used outside of conditional statements, loops, binary logical operations, or conditional expressions, and issues a warning if such usage is detected. The script includes a note about potential false positives and suggests possible solutions, such as switching from an allow list to a deny list or adding dataflow analysis to improve accuracy. The script is identified by the ID `asymmetric-research/builtin-expect-scope-too-narrow` and is categorized as a problem with a severity level of warning.
