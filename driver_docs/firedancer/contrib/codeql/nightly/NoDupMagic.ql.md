Detects duplicate magic constants in code to prevent type confusion.

# Purpose
The code defines a rule to identify duplicate magic constants in a codebase. Magic constants are unique identifiers used to prevent type confusion in programming. The rule ensures that no two types have the same magic constant, which helps maintain type safety and clarity in the code. The rule is categorized as a problem with a warning severity level, indicating that while it may not cause immediate errors, it is important to address to prevent potential issues.

The `MagicConstant` class extends a `Macro` and is designed to identify magic constants within files located in the `src` directory. The constructor of the `MagicConstant` class uses pattern matching to identify relevant constants by checking if their names match the pattern `%MAGIC%` and if they are located in the specified directory path. The `getFullyConverted` method retrieves the fully converted expression of an invocation, which is used to compare magic constants.

The code uses a query to find pairs of `MagicConstant` instances (`a` and `b`) that have the same body or fully converted expression. It ensures that the constants are included in the analysis and selects the one with the lexicographically greater name. The query then outputs a warning message indicating that the selected magic constant has the same value as another, helping developers identify and resolve these duplications.
