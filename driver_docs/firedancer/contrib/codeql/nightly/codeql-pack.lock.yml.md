Specifies dependencies and their versions for a CodeQL pack.

# Purpose
The YAML configuration file specifies the dependencies and their respective versions for a project using CodeQL, a tool for code analysis. The `lockVersion` field indicates the version of the lock file format, ensuring compatibility with the tool's versioning system. Each dependency is listed under the `dependencies` section, with its name and version number, which helps manage and maintain consistent versions across different environments. The `compiled` field, set to `false`, indicates that the dependencies have not been compiled, which may be relevant for build or deployment processes. This configuration ensures that the correct versions of CodeQL libraries are used for analysis tasks.
