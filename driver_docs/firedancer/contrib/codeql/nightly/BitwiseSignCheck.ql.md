Detects potentially unsafe sign checks in bitwise operations in C++ code, issuing a warning.

# Purpose
The metadata content defines a code analysis rule for identifying potentially unsafe sign checks in C++ bitwise operations. The rule is categorized as a problem with a severity level of `warning` and a precision level of `high`. It targets situations where a relational operation checks if the result of a bitwise operation is greater than zero, which may lead to incorrect assumptions about the sign of the result. The rule applies to signed integral types and specifically flags cases where the bitwise operation involves a constant negative operand. It excludes cases affected by macros and ensures that the location of the issue is included in the analysis. The rule is identified by the ID `cpp/bitwise-sign-check` and is tagged for reliability and correctness.
