Identifies functions with `is` prefix that return non-boolean values.

# Purpose
This code is a query written for a static analysis tool, specifically targeting C++ code. It identifies functions that are named with the `is` prefix, which typically suggests a boolean return type, but actually return values outside the standard boolean range of 0 and 1. The purpose of this query is to highlight potential issues in code correctness and maintainability by flagging functions that may mislead developers due to their naming conventions.

The code defines a class `IsFunction` that extends the `Function` class. This class is used to identify functions whose names match a specific pattern, indicating they are likely intended to return boolean values. The pattern is defined using the `matches` method with the expression `"%\\_is\\_%"`, which captures functions with names containing the substring `is`. The class also checks that the function's return type is an `IntegralType` and excludes a specific function named `fd_bn254_pairing_is_one_syscall` from this analysis.

The query then uses a `from` clause to iterate over instances of `IsFunction` and their associated return statements. It calculates the lower and upper bounds of the return values using range analysis. If the bounds fall outside the range of 0 to 1, the query selects these return statements and generates a warning message. This message indicates that the function's name suggests a boolean return type, but the actual return value range is different, which could lead to misunderstandings in the code's behavior.

### IsFunction
- **Type**: ``class``
- **Members**:
    - ``IsFunction``: Represents a function whose name suggests it returns a boolean value (0 or 1).
- **Description**: Identifies functions with names that suggest a boolean return type, specifically those starting with the `is` prefix, but which return values outside the typical boolean range of 0 and 1. The `IsFunction` class extends the `Function` class and includes a constructor that matches function names with the pattern `%_is_%`, checks if the function type is an `IntegralType`, and excludes specific function names like `fd_bn254_pairing_is_one_syscall`. The class is used in a query to find return statements within these functions where the return value's range is not limited to 0 or 1.
