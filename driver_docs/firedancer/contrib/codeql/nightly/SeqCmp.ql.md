Identifies sequence number comparisons not using fd_seq_* functions, issuing a low-precision warning.

# Purpose
The code is a static analysis rule designed to identify improper relational comparisons of sequence numbers in C++ source files. It specifically targets sequence numbers that do not use the designated `fd_seq_*` functions for comparison. The rule is part of a code quality or linting tool, and it issues a warning when it detects such comparisons, suggesting the use of `fd_seq_lt`, `fd_seq_le`, `fd_seq_ge`, `fd_seq_gt`, or equivalent functions instead.

The code defines a predicate `include` that filters locations to only include files within the "src/" directory, excluding those with base names matching "fd_cstr%". It then defines a class `SeqNum` that extends `Variable`, identifying variables with names containing "seq" and located in files that pass the `include` predicate. The main logic of the rule is a query that searches for relational operations between two sequence number variables (`SeqNum` instances) that do not use the appropriate `fd_seq_*` functions. The query ensures that the operations are not simple equality or inequality checks, which are allowed, and it avoids duplicate results by comparing the names of the target variables.

The rule is intended to be used as part of a larger static analysis framework, likely integrated into a build or continuous integration process. It helps maintain code quality by enforcing consistent and correct usage of sequence number comparison functions, which may be critical for ensuring the correctness and reliability of the software.

### SeqNum
- **Type**: ``class``
- **Members**:
    - ``SeqNum``: Represents a sequence number that extends the `Variable` class.
- **Description**: Represents a sequence number that extends the `Variable` class. The `SeqNum` class constructor checks if the name of the variable matches a pattern related to sequence numbers and if its location is included in the specified source path. This class is used to identify sequence numbers in code for relational comparisons, ensuring that specific functions are used for comparison instead of direct relational operations.
