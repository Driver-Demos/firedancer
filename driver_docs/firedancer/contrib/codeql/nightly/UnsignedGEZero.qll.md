Classes and predicates for the UnsignedGEZero query, used to avoid duplicate results with PointlessComparison.

# Purpose
The code defines a library for implementing the `UnsignedGEZero` query, which identifies expressions where an unsigned value is compared to zero. This library is also utilized by the `PointlessComparison` query to prevent duplicate reporting of the same result. The `PointlessComparison` query is a more general query that also detects instances of the `UnsignedGEZero` pattern.

The code includes several key components. The `ConstantZero` class extends `Expr` and represents a constant expression with the value "0". The `lookForUnsignedAt` predicate checks if a given relational operation involves an unsigned expression compared to zero, either directly or through type conversions. The `UnsignedGEZero` class extends `ComparisonOperation` and uses the `lookForUnsignedAt` predicate to identify unsigned expressions that are compared to zero. The `unsignedGEZero` predicate generates an alert message for such comparisons, ensuring that the expression is not part of a macro invocation or a template instantiation.

Overall, the code provides a focused functionality for detecting and reporting potentially pointless comparisons of unsigned values to zero, which can be a source of logical errors in code. It defines a specific query and related predicates to identify these patterns and generate appropriate alerts.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `cpp`


# Data Structures

---
### ConstantZero
- **Type**: ``class``
- **Members**:
    - ``ConstantZero``: Represents an expression that is a constant with the value "0".
- **Description**: Represents an expression that is a constant with the value "0". It extends the `Expr` class and is used to identify expressions that are constant and equal to zero, particularly in the context of unsigned comparisons.


---
### UnsignedGEZero
- **Type**: ``class``
- **Members**:
    - ``UnsignedGEZero``: Represents a comparison operation that checks for unsigned expressions greater than or equal to zero.
- **Description**: The `UnsignedGEZero` class extends `ComparisonOperation` and identifies expressions where an unsigned type is compared to zero using a greater than or equal operation. It uses the `lookForUnsignedAt` predicate to find such expressions and ensures that the underlying type of the expression is unsigned.
