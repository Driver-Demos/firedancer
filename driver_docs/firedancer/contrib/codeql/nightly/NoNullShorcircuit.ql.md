Detects potential null pointer access without short-circuiting in C++ code, issuing a warning.

# Purpose
This code defines a rule for identifying a specific problem pattern in C++ code, where a potential null pointer is checked and then accessed without using short-circuit logic. It is part of a static analysis tool or a code quality checker, as indicated by the metadata annotations such as `@kind problem` and `@problem.severity warning`. The code uses pattern matching to detect instances where a binary bitwise operation involves a left-hand side expression and a right-hand side pointer field access, ensuring that the types match and the operation is included in the analysis scope. The rule generates a warning when this pattern is detected, highlighting the potential risk of null pointer dereference.
