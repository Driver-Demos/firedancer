Detects pointer overflow issues in C++ code that can lead to memory corruption, with high precision.

# Purpose
The code defines a problem detection rule for identifying pointer overflow checks in C++ code. Pointer overflow occurs when a value is added to a pointer, potentially causing it to exceed its allocated memory range, which can lead to undefined behavior and memory corruption. This rule is part of a static analysis tool that aims to improve code reliability and security by identifying such problematic patterns.

The rule imports several modules, including `cpp`, `semmle.code.cpp.valuenumbering.GlobalValueNumbering`, and `semmle.code.cpp.commons.Exclusions`, which are used to analyze C++ code and manage exclusions. The rule uses a query to identify relational operations (`RelationalOperation`) that involve pointer addition expressions (`PointerAddExpr`). It checks if the operands of these operations are equivalent in terms of global value numbering, which is a technique used to identify expressions that compute the same value.

The rule excludes operations originating from macro definitions and ensures that the file is compiled without specific flags (`-fwrapv-pointer` and `-fno-strict-overflow`) that would make pointer overflow behavior well-defined. If these conditions are met, the rule selects the relational operation as a potential issue, indicating a range check that relies on pointer overflow. This detection is tagged with reliability and security concerns, and it is associated with the external Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) identifier CWE-758.
