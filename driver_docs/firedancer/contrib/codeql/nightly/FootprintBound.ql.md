Detects structs that do not fit within their defined footprint macros, issuing warnings.

# Purpose
The code is a script that checks if specific data structures, referred to as structs, fit within predefined memory footprints. It uses a predicate function `fitsInFootprint` to determine if a struct's size is less than or equal to the size specified by a corresponding macro. The script imports modules `cpp` and `filter`, which are likely used to parse and analyze C++ code and apply filtering logic, respectively.

The script defines a series of conditions using the `where` clause. Each condition checks a specific struct against a macro that defines its expected footprint. If a struct does not fit within its defined footprint, the script identifies this as a problem with a severity level of "warning" and a precision level of "high". The script checks multiple struct-macro pairs, such as `fd_funk_private` against `FD_FUNK_FOOTPRINT` and `fd_blake3_private` against `FD_BLAKE3_FOOTPRINT`.

The output of the script is a selection of struct names that do not fit within their respective footprints, along with a message indicating the mismatch. This functionality is useful for developers to ensure that data structures conform to memory constraints, which can be critical for performance and resource management in software systems.
