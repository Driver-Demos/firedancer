Detects redundant unsigned comparisons to zero in C++ code, which may indicate a potential bug.

# Purpose
This code is a query for a static analysis tool that identifies instances where an unsigned value is compared to zero in C++ code. The comparison is redundant because unsigned values are always non-negative, which can indicate a potential bug or a misunderstanding in the code logic. The query imports necessary modules and uses a filter to select occurrences of this pattern, providing a warning with very high precision. The purpose is to improve code maintainability and readability by highlighting these unnecessary comparisons.
