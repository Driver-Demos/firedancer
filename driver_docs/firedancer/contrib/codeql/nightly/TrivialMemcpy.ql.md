Identifies `memcpy` calls that can be replaced with assignment for better maintainability and readability.

# Purpose
The code is a static analysis tool designed to identify and recommend improvements in C or C++ codebases where the `memcpy` function is used. The primary purpose is to suggest replacing `memcpy` calls with direct assignment operations when possible. This recommendation is based on the observation that `memcpy` can introduce bugs due to weaker typing, whereas direct assignments are typically safer and more readable.

The code defines a class `MemcpyFunction` that extends a `Function` class to identify functions with global or standard names like `memcpy`, `fd_memcpy`, or `__builtin_memcpy`. It also includes a predicate `ignoredLocation` to exclude certain files, such as `cJSON.c`, from analysis, likely to avoid modifying third-party or vendor code unnecessarily. The `InScopeType` class is used to filter pointer types that are suitable for transformation, excluding array pointers and specific types like `fd_txn_p` and `fd_hash` that are not directly assignable.

The analysis is performed by querying function calls that match the criteria defined by `MemcpyFunction` and `InScopeType`. The tool checks if the `memcpy` call is not within a macro expansion and is not in an ignored location. It then verifies that the types of the arguments are compatible for assignment by comparing them with the type obtained from the `sizeof` operator. If all conditions are met, the tool selects the `memcpy` call and suggests that it could be rewritten as a direct assignment, enhancing maintainability and readability.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `cpp`
- `filter`


# Data Structures

---
### MemcpyFunction
- **Type**: ``class``
- **Members**:
    - ``MemcpyFunction``: Extends the `Function` class to identify calls to `memcpy` or its variants.
- **Description**: Identifies and processes function calls to `memcpy`, `fd_memcpy`, or `__builtin_memcpy` to suggest that an assignment could replace them for better maintainability and readability.


---
### InScopeType
- **Type**: ``class``
- **Members**:
    - ``InScopeType``: Represents pointer types that are in scope for a query, excluding pointer to array types and specific types like `fd_txn_p` and `fd_hash`.
- **Description**: Represents pointer types that are in scope for a query, excluding pointer to array types and specific types like `fd_txn_p` and `fd_hash`. It extends the `PointerType` class and is used to determine if a pointer type can be directly assigned instead of using `memcpy`.


# Functions

---
### ignoredLocation
Checks if a given location corresponds to a file named `cJSON.c` to avoid unnecessary changes to vendored code.
- **Inputs**:
    - ``l``: A `Location` object representing the location to check.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Get the base name of the file from the `Location` object `l`.
    - Check if the base name is equal to `cJSON.c`.
- **Output**: Returns true if the file's base name is `cJSON.c`, otherwise false.


---
### getSizeofType
Gets the type whose size is being queried by a `SizeofOperator`.
- **Inputs**:
    - `so`: A `SizeofOperator` object from which the type operand or expression operand type is retrieved.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Check if `so` is an instance of `SizeofTypeOperator` and get the type operand using `getTypeOperand()` method.
    - If the first check fails, assume `so` is an instance of `SizeofExprOperator` and get the expression operand's type using `getExprOperand().getType()` method.
- **Output**: The function returns a `Type` object that represents the type whose size is being queried.
