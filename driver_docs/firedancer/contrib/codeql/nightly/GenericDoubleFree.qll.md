Defines a data flow configuration to detect double free vulnerabilities in C++ code.

# Purpose
The code defines a configuration for a data flow analysis module, specifically targeting the detection of double-free vulnerabilities in C++ code. It imports necessary modules, such as `cpp` and `semmle.code.cpp.dataflow.new.DataFlow`, which are likely part of a larger static analysis framework. The code defines a `CandidateCall` class that extends `Call`, filtering out certain files like `main.c` and `spy.c` from analysis, which suggests these files are not relevant for the double-free detection.

The `DoubleFreeConfig` module implements the `DataFlow::StateConfigSig` interface, indicating it is part of a data flow analysis configuration. It defines a `FlowState` as a string and includes predicates `isSource`, `isBarrier`, and `isSink`. These predicates determine the roles of nodes in the data flow graph concerning double-free vulnerabilities. The `isSource` predicate identifies nodes that can potentially introduce a double-free condition, `isBarrier` identifies nodes that can interrupt the flow, and `isSink` identifies nodes where the double-free condition might manifest. The use of `regcap` functions `doubleMatch` and `barrierMatch` suggests pattern matching on function names to classify nodes in the data flow.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `cpp`
- `semmle.code.cpp.dataflow.new.DataFlow`


# Data Structures

---
### CandidateCall
- **Type**: ``class``
- **Members**:
    - ``CandidateCall``: Extends the `Call` class and represents a call that does not match certain file name patterns.
- **Description**: Represents a specialized call that excludes certain file names from consideration, such as those matching patterns like "test%", "%_ci.%", "main.c", and "spy.c". This class is used in the context of data flow analysis to identify specific function calls that should be excluded from analysis based on their file location.

### DoubleFreeConfig
- **Type**: ``module``
- **Members**:
    - ``FlowState``: Defines a type alias for `string`.
    - ``isSource``: Defines a predicate to identify source nodes in the data flow based on a `CandidateCall` and `FlowState`.
    - ``isBarrier``: Defines a predicate to identify barrier nodes in the data flow based on a `CandidateCall` and `FlowState`.
    - ``isSink``: Defines a predicate to identify sink nodes in the data flow based on a `CandidateCall` and `FlowState`.
- **Description**: Implements the `DataFlow::StateConfigSig` interface to configure data flow analysis for detecting double free vulnerabilities by defining source, barrier, and sink predicates using `CandidateCall` and `FlowState`.
