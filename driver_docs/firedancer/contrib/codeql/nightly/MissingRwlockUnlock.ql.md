Detects functions where an `fd_rwlock` is not unlocked on all code paths, issuing a warning.

# Purpose
This code is a query script designed to identify potential issues in C++ code related to the use of `fd_rwlock` locks. It specifically targets functions where a `fd_rwlock` is acquired but not released on all execution paths, which can lead to resource leaks or deadlocks. The script defines classes `LockCall` and `UnlockCall` to detect function calls that acquire and release locks, respectively. It uses control flow analysis to find paths where a lock is acquired but not followed by a corresponding unlock operation. The script is intended to be used as a static analysis tool, issuing warnings when it detects such mismatches in lock and unlock calls.
