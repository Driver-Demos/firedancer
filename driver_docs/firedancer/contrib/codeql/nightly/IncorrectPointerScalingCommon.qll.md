Shared utilities for CWE-468 queries, including functions for analyzing pointer arithmetic and `sizeof` expressions.

# Purpose
The code provides shared utility functions and predicates for analyzing `sizeof` expressions and pointer arithmetic in C/C++ code. It is part of a query system, likely used for static analysis or code querying, specifically related to CWE-468, which involves incorrect pointer scaling. The code is not an executable or a library but a collection of utility functions intended to be used within a larger analysis framework.

The code defines several private functions and predicates that help identify and work with `sizeof` expressions and pointer types. The `sizeofParam` function extracts the type parameter from a `sizeof` expression. The `multiplyWithSizeof` predicate checks if an expression involves a `sizeof` expression, possibly multiplied by another expression, and identifies the type parameter of the `sizeof` expression. The `addWithSizeof` predicate determines if a pointer is added to a `sizeof` expression, which may be multiplied by another expression, and identifies the type parameter.

Additional predicates and functions include `isPointerType`, which checks if a type is a pointer or array type, and `baseType`, which retrieves the base type of a pointer or array type. The `exprSourceType` and `defSourceType` predicates are used to trace the source of pointer expressions and their types, considering operations like addition, subtraction, and increment. The `pointerArithmeticParent` function identifies the pointer arithmetic expression in which a given expression is directly used. These utilities are essential for analyzing and understanding pointer arithmetic and type usage in C/C++ code.

# Functions

---
### sizeofParam
Gets the type parameter of a `sizeof` expression `e`.
- **Inputs**:
    - ``e``: An expression of type `Expr` that represents a `sizeof` expression.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Check if `e` is an instance of `SizeofExprOperator` and get the type of its operand using `getExprOperand().getFullyConverted().getType()`.
    - If the above condition is not met, check if `e` is an instance of `SizeofTypeOperator` and get its type operand using `getTypeOperand()`.
- **Output**: Returns a `Type` object that represents the type parameter of the `sizeof` expression.


---
### multiplyWithSizeof
Determines if an expression `e` is a `sizeof` expression, possibly multiplied by another expression, and verifies the type parameter of the `sizeof` expression.
- **Inputs**:
    - ``e``: An expression to check if it is a `sizeof` expression or a multiplication involving a `sizeof` expression.
    - ``sizeofExpr``: The `sizeof` expression to compare against `e`.
    - ``sizeofParam``: The type parameter of the `sizeof` expression.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Check if `e` is equal to `sizeofExpr` and if `sizeofParam` is equal to the unspecified type of `sizeofExpr`'s type parameter.
    - If the above condition is not met, recursively call `multiplyWithSizeof` on one of the operands of `e` if `e` is a multiplication expression (`MulExpr`).
- **Output**: A boolean value indicating whether `e` is a `sizeof` expression or a multiplication involving a `sizeof` expression with the specified type parameter.


---
### addWithSizeof
Determines if a pointer expression `e` is added to or subtracted from a `sizeof` expression `sizeofExpr`, with `sizeofParam` as the type parameter of `sizeofExpr`.
- **Inputs**:
    - ``e``: An expression representing a pointer.
    - ``sizeofExpr``: An expression representing a `sizeof` operation, possibly multiplied by another expression.
    - ``sizeofParam``: The type parameter of the `sizeof` expression.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Checks if there exists a `PointerAddExpr` where `e` is the left operand and the right operand satisfies the `multiplyWithSizeof` predicate with `sizeofExpr` and `sizeofParam`.
    - Checks if there exists a `PointerSubExpr` where `e` is the left operand and the right operand satisfies the `multiplyWithSizeof` predicate with `sizeofExpr` and `sizeofParam`.
- **Output**: A boolean value indicating whether the conditions for `addWithSizeof` are met.


---
### isPointerType
Determines if a given type is a pointer or array type.
- **Inputs**:
    - ``t``: The type to check if it is a pointer or array type.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Check if `t` is an instance of `PointerType`.
    - If not, check if `t` is an instance of `ArrayType`.
    - Return true if either condition is met.
- **Output**: A boolean value indicating whether `t` is a pointer or array type.


---
### baseType
Gets the base type of a pointer or array type, returning the innermost base type for arrays of arrays.
- **Inputs**:
    - ``t``: A `Type` object representing a pointer or array type.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Check if `t` is a `PointerType`; if true, set `result` to the base type of `t` after removing any unspecified type information.
    - Check if `t` is an `ArrayType` and its base type is not another `ArrayType`; if true, set `result` to the base type of `t` after removing any unspecified type information.
    - If `t` is an `ArrayType` and its base type is another `ArrayType`, recursively call `baseType` on the base type of `t` to get the innermost base type.
    - Ensure that the `result` type has a size and is not ambiguous by checking that the size count is exactly 1.
- **Output**: The innermost base `Type` of the input pointer or array type `t`.


---
### exprSourceType
Determines if there is a pointer expression with a specific type and location that might be the source expression for a given use.
- **Inputs**:
    - ``use``: An `Expr` object representing the expression whose source type is being determined.
    - ``sourceType``: A `Type` object representing the type of the source expression.
    - ``sourceLoc``: A `Location` object representing the location of the source expression.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Check if there exists an `SsaDefinition` where `use` is a use of a variable; if so, determine the source type using `defSourceType`.
    - If `use` is an instance of `PointerAddExpr`, recursively call `exprSourceType` on the left operand of `use`.
    - If `use` is an instance of `PointerSubExpr`, recursively call `exprSourceType` on the left operand of `use`.
    - If `use` is an instance of `AddExpr`, recursively call `exprSourceType` on any operand of `use`.
    - If `use` is an instance of `SubExpr`, recursively call `exprSourceType` on any operand of `use`.
    - If `use` is an instance of `CrementOperation`, recursively call `exprSourceType` on the operand of `use`.
    - If `use` is not an instance of `Conversion`, check if `sourceType` is the unspecified type of `use`, ensure it is a pointer type, and set `sourceLoc` to the location of `use`.
- **Output**: A boolean value indicating whether there is a pointer expression with the specified type and location that might be the source expression for `use`.


---
### defSourceType
Determines if there is a pointer expression with a specific type at a given location that might define the value of a stack variable at a specific definition.
- **Inputs**:
    - ``def``: An `SsaDefinition` object representing the definition context to check.
    - ``v``: A `StackVariable` object representing the variable whose source type is being determined.
    - ``sourceType``: A `Type` object representing the type of the source expression.
    - ``sourceLoc``: A `Location` object representing the location of the source expression.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Checks if the defining value of `v` in `def` has a source type and location using `exprSourceType`.
    - If not, recursively checks the phi inputs of `def` for `v` using `defSourceType`.
    - If neither of the above holds, checks if `v` is defined by a parameter, and if so, verifies the type and location of the parameter.
- **Output**: A boolean value indicating whether a pointer expression with the specified type and location might define the value of the stack variable at the given definition.
