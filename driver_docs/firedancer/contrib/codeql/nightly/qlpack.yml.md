Configuration for a CodeQL package with C++ extractor and dependencies for nightly queries.

# Purpose
The file defines metadata for a software package. It specifies the package name as `asymmetric-research/fd-nightly-queries` and version `0.0.1`. The `extractor` field indicates that the package uses the `cpp` extractor. The `warnOnImplicitThis` field is set to `true`, which configures the package to issue warnings when implicit `this` is used in C++ code. The `dependencies` section lists `codeql/cpp-all` with a version constraint of `"*"`, indicating a dependency on all available versions of the `codeql/cpp-all` package.
