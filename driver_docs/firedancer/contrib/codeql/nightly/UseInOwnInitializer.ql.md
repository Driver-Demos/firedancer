Detects and warns about variables used in their own initializers, which can cause undefined behavior.

# Purpose
This code defines a static analysis rule for identifying a specific problem in C++ code: the use of a variable within its own initializer. This can lead to undefined behavior, which is a critical issue for code maintainability and correctness. The rule is implemented as a class `VariableAccessInInitializer`, which extends the `VariableAccess` class. The class includes a constructor and a predicate function to determine if a variable is initialized with itself.

The `VariableAccessInInitializer` class contains two main components: a `Variable` and an `Initializer`. The constructor uses a pragma directive to ensure that the initialization logic is not optimized away by the compiler. The predicate `initializesItself` checks if a given variable and initializer are the same as those stored in the class instance, indicating that the variable is used in its own initialization.

The code also includes a query that selects instances where a variable is used in its own initializer. It checks several conditions, such as whether the variable undergoes an LValue-to-RValue conversion, is part of an assignment, or is used in a crement operation. The query excludes cases where the variable is constant, unevaluated, or part of a macro expansion. If these conditions are met, the code selects the variable access instance and generates a warning message indicating the issue.

### VariableAccessInInitializer
- **Type**: ``class``
- **Members**:
    - ``var``: A `Variable` object that represents the variable being initialized.
    - ``init``: An `Initializer` object that represents the initializer of the variable.
- **Description**: Represents a scenario where a variable is used in its own initializer, which can lead to undefined behavior. The class extends `VariableAccess` and includes a constructor that checks if the initializer's declaration matches the variable and if the initializer's expression has a child that is the current instance. It also includes a predicate `initializesItself` to verify if a variable is initialized by itself.
