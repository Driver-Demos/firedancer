Implements the BadAdditionOverflowCheck query to detect incorrect overflow checks in C++ code.

# Purpose
The code provides an implementation of the `BadAdditionOverflowCheck` query, which is designed to identify potential overflow issues in addition operations within C++ code. This implementation is structured as a library to prevent the generation of duplicate results when used in conjunction with other similar queries. The code imports necessary components from the C++ library and a private module for range analysis utilities, indicating its reliance on existing functionalities for analyzing code expressions.

The core functionality is encapsulated in two predicates: `addExpr` and `badAdditionOverflowCheck`. The `addExpr` predicate is responsible for determining if two expressions, `a` and `b`, are operands of an addition expression (`plus`). It simplifies pattern matching by considering both possible operand orders. The `badAdditionOverflowCheck` predicate identifies cases where an addition operation might lead to an overflow, specifically when the operation is followed by a relational comparison of the form `a + b < a`. This predicate includes checks to ensure that the addition does not involve automatic type promotion to a larger type, which would invalidate the overflow check. It also verifies that the addition is not explicitly cast to a smaller type, which could mask potential overflow issues.

Overall, the code is a specialized library component that provides a mechanism to detect unsafe addition operations that could result in overflow, focusing on specific patterns and conditions that indicate such risks. It is intended for use in static analysis tools that aim to improve code safety by identifying and mitigating potential arithmetic errors.
