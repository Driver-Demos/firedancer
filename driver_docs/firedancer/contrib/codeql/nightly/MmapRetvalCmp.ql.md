Detects unverified mmap calls by identifying paths where mmap return values are not compared to MAP_FAILED.

# Purpose
The code defines a static analysis module that identifies potential issues in C++ code where calls to the `mmap` function are not checked for failure. The module is implemented using a data flow analysis framework, specifically leveraging the `semmle.code.cpp.dataflow.new.DataFlow` library. The primary purpose of this module is to detect paths in the code where the return value of `mmap` is not compared against `MAP_FAILED` (represented by `-1`), which is necessary to ensure that the memory mapping operation was successful.

The module `Config` implements the `DataFlow::ConfigSig` interface and defines two predicates: `isSource` and `isSink`. The `isSource` predicate identifies nodes in the data flow graph where the `mmap` function is called. It checks if a variable is assigned the result of an `mmap` function call. The `isSink` predicate identifies nodes where a comparison operation checks if the result of `mmap` is equal to `-1`, indicating a failure. The module uses these predicates to configure a data flow analysis that tracks the flow of data from sources to sinks.

The analysis is executed by the `Flow` module, which is an instance of `DataFlow::Global` configured with the `Config` module. The `from` clause in the code specifies the conditions under which a warning is generated. It selects paths where there is no flow from a source to a sink, meaning that the `mmap` return value is not properly checked for failure. The analysis results in a warning message indicating that a call to `mmap` is not checked for failure, helping developers identify and fix potential issues in their code.
