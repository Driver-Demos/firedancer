Detects redundant null checks in C++ code where a pointer is checked for nullness after being dereferenced.

# Purpose
The code is a static analysis module designed to identify redundant null checks in C++ code. It detects situations where a pointer is checked for nullness after it has already been dereferenced. This is a potential error because dereferencing a null pointer can lead to undefined behavior. The module uses a combination of predicates and classes to analyze the intermediate representation (IR) of the code, focusing on instructions that involve null pointer checks and dereferences.

The `NullInstruction` class represents a null pointer in the IR, and the `explicitNullTestOfInstruction` predicate identifies instructions that compare a pointer against a null value. The `candidateResult` predicate determines if a load instruction is a candidate for reporting based on its involvement in a null check and its control flow dominance. The `PathGraph` module constructs a control-flow graph to trace the path from a dereference to a null check, ensuring that the analysis only reports relevant paths by compacting the edges relation.

The module concludes with a query that selects instances of redundant null checks, providing a message that explains the redundancy. The analysis is precise, with a high severity level, and it is tagged for reliability, correctness, and security, aligning with the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) identifier CWE-476. This module is intended to be part of a larger static analysis toolchain, providing insights into potential code issues related to null pointer dereferencing.

### NullInstruction
- **Type**: ``class``
- **Members**:
    - ``NullInstruction``: Represents a null pointer as an instruction.
- **Description**: The `NullInstruction` class extends `ConstantValueInstruction` and represents a null pointer in the intermediate representation (IR) of a program. It initializes with a value of "0" and ensures that the result IR type is an instance of `IRAddressType`. This class is used to identify and handle null pointer instructions within the code analysis framework.
