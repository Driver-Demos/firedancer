Detects potential mismatches in memset size arguments where the type of the first argument differs from the sizeof type.

# Purpose
The code is a static analysis tool designed to detect potential issues with the use of the `memset` function in C or C++ code. Specifically, it identifies cases where the size argument in a `memset` call might be incorrect due to a mismatch between the type of the first argument and the type used in the `sizeof` operator. This is important for ensuring that memory operations are performed correctly and safely, preventing potential buffer overflows or memory corruption.

The code defines a class `MemsetFunction` that extends a `Function` class. This class is used to identify functions that are globally named `fd_memset`, `memset`, `bzero`, or `__builtin_memset`. The `sizeIdx` method determines the index of the size argument based on the function name, which is crucial for the subsequent analysis.

The analysis is performed by examining function calls to `memset` and checking if the size argument is derived from a `SizeofTypeOperator`. It then compares the type of the first argument with the type used in the `sizeof` operator. If there is a mismatch and the type is not `char`, `unsigned char`, or `void`, a warning is generated. This warning indicates that the call to `memset` might be of incorrect size, providing details about the types involved.
