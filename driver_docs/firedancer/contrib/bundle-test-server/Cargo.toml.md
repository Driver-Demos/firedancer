Configuration for the `bundle-test-server` package with dependencies and build settings.

# Purpose
The file defines the configuration for a Rust project using the Cargo package manager. It specifies the package metadata, including the `name`, `version`, and `edition` of the project. The `[dependencies]` section lists the libraries required for the project, such as `tonic`, `prost`, and `tokio`, along with their respective versions and any specific features needed, like `tls-webpki-roots` for `tonic`. The `[build-dependencies]` section includes dependencies necessary for building the project, such as `tonic-prost-build` and `protobuf-src`. The `[dev-dependencies]` section specifies libraries used for development and testing, like `ed25519-dalek`. Additionally, the `[profile.release-with-debug]` section customizes the release profile to include debug information, with `debug` set to `true` and `split-debuginfo` configured as `packed`.
