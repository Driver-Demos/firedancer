Defines protobuf messages for Header, Heartbeat, and Socket with timestamp, count, IP, and port.

# Purpose
This file defines a Protocol Buffers schema using `proto3` syntax. It provides a narrow functionality by specifying the structure of data messages for serialization and deserialization. The file imports the `google/protobuf/timestamp.proto` to use the `Timestamp` type in the `Header` message. It defines three messages: `Header`, which includes a timestamp; `Heartbeat`, which contains a count as an unsigned 64-bit integer; and `Socket`, which includes an IP address as a string and a port as a 64-bit integer. These messages are part of the `shared` package, indicating they are intended for use across different components or services that require consistent data structures.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `google/protobuf/timestamp.proto`


# Data Structures

---
### Header
- **Type**: ``message``
- **Members**:
    - ``ts``: A `google.protobuf.Timestamp` object that represents a timestamp.
- **Description**: Represents a protocol buffer message that contains a single field `ts`, which is a timestamp from the `google.protobuf.Timestamp` type. This message is part of the `shared` package and is used to store time-related data.


---
### Heartbeat
- **Type**: ``message``
- **Members**:
    - ``count``: A 64-bit unsigned integer that represents the heartbeat count.
- **Description**: Represents a `message` in the Protocol Buffers format that contains a single field `count`, which is a 64-bit unsigned integer. This field is used to track the number of heartbeats.


---
### Socket
- **Type**: ``message``
- **Members**:
    - ``ip``: A string that represents the IP address.
    - ``port``: An integer that represents the port number.
- **Description**: Represents a network socket with an IP address and a port number, used for network communication.
