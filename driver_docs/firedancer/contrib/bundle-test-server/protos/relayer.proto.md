Defines gRPC services for Solana validators to fetch TPU configurations and subscribe to packet streams.

# Purpose
The `proto3` syntax file defines a gRPC service named `Relayer` for Solana validators. It imports dependencies from `packet.proto` and `shared.proto` to utilize shared data structures. The `Relayer` service provides two main functionalities: fetching TPU (Transaction Processing Unit) configurations and subscribing to packet streams. The `GetTpuConfigs` RPC allows validators to retrieve TPU and TPU forward socket configurations, which they can use to update their gossip network settings. The `SubscribePackets` RPC enables validators to receive a stream of packets and heartbeats, facilitating real-time data exchange and synchronization with the relayer's TPU ports.
