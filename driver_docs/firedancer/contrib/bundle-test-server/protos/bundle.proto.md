Defines protocol buffer messages for handling bundle processing results, including acceptance, rejection, and status updates.

# Purpose
The file defines a protocol buffer schema using `proto3` syntax, which is used to serialize structured data. It imports two other protocol files, `packet.proto` and `shared.proto`, indicating dependencies on shared message definitions. The schema is organized under the `bundle` package and defines several message types related to the processing of data bundles. The `Bundle` message includes a header and a list of packets, while `BundleUuid` associates a bundle with a unique identifier. The file also defines various result types for bundles, such as `Accepted`, `Rejected`, `WinningBatchBidRejected`, `StateAuctionBidRejected`, `SimulationFailure`, `InternalError`, and `DroppedBundle`, each with specific fields to capture the outcome of bundle processing. Additionally, the `BundleResult` message uses a `oneof` construct to encapsulate different processing results, such as `Accepted`, `Rejected`, `Finalized`, `Processed`, and `Dropped`, providing a comprehensive framework for handling bundle lifecycle events in a distributed system.
# Content Summary
The provided content is a Protocol Buffers (proto3) schema definition for a system that manages and processes data bundles. The schema defines several messages and enumerations that describe the structure and processing outcomes of these bundles.

1. **Package and Imports**: The schema is part of the `bundle` package and imports definitions from `packet.proto` and `shared.proto`. These imports suggest dependencies on other message definitions, specifically for `packet.Packet` and `shared.Header`.

2. **Primary Messages**:
   - `Bundle`: This message contains a `shared.Header` and a list of `packet.Packet` objects. It represents a collection of packets with associated metadata.
   - `BundleUuid`: This message links a `Bundle` with a unique identifier (`uuid`), allowing for distinct identification of each bundle.

3. **Result Types**:
   - `Accepted`: Indicates a bundle was accepted and forwarded to a validator. It includes the slot number and the validator's identity.
   - `Rejected`: Indicates a bundle was not forwarded due to various reasons encapsulated in a `oneof` construct. Possible reasons include auction bid rejections, simulation failures, internal errors, or other conditions leading to a dropped bundle.
   - `WinningBatchBidRejected` and `StateAuctionBidRejected`: These messages provide details on why a bundle's bid was rejected in the context of state auctions, including auction identifiers and bid amounts.
   - `SimulationFailure`, `InternalError`, and `DroppedBundle`: These messages describe specific failure scenarios, each with an optional message field for additional context.

4. **Processing States**:
   - `Finalized`: Represents a state where the bundle has reached a finalized commitment level.
   - `Processed`: Contains details about the validator identity, slot, and bundle index within a block, indicating the bundle has been processed.
   - `Dropped`: Indicates the bundle was accepted but not finalized, with reasons specified in the `DroppedReason` enumeration.

5. **DroppedReason Enumeration**: This enumeration provides reasons for a bundle being dropped, such as `BlockhashExpired`, `PartiallyProcessed`, or `NotFinalized`.

6. **BundleResult**: This message encapsulates the outcome of processing a bundle, identified by `bundle_id`. It uses a `oneof` construct to specify the result, which can be `Accepted`, `Rejected`, `Finalized`, `Processed`, or `Dropped`.

This schema is essential for developers working with the system to understand how bundles are structured, processed, and the possible outcomes of their processing. It provides a clear framework for handling data bundles within the system, including error handling and state management.
