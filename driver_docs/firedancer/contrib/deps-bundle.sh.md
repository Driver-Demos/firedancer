Creates a redistributable bundle of build dependencies using Zstandard compression and GNU tar.

# Purpose
The `deps-bundle.sh` script is a Bash script that creates a redistributable bundle of build dependencies. It is intended to simplify the build process by packaging necessary static libraries and include files into a compressed archive named `deps-bundle.tar.zst`. This script requires a recent compiler and linker, along with the Zstandard compression tool and GNU tar, to function. Before running this script, users must create a dependency prefix at `./opt` using another script named `deps.sh`. The resulting bundle is approximately 13 MB in size and can be stored in blob storage systems like Git LFS.
