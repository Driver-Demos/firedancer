Shell script to search for and exit on lines with 'for (' or 'if (' in the codebase.

# Purpose
The script is a shell script that checks for specific patterns in a Git repository. It searches for occurrences of the patterns `for (` and `if (` within the codebase using the `git grep` command. If either pattern is found, the script exits with a status code of 1, indicating that the patterns were detected. This script provides narrow functionality, serving as a code quality check to enforce coding standards or detect specific code constructs.
