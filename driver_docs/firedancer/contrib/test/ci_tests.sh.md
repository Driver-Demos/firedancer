Builds and runs CI tests, optionally exporting coverage data, and warns about build directory destruction.

# Purpose
The `ci_tests.sh` script is a Bash script designed to automate the process of building and running tests in a continuous integration (CI) environment. It checks for necessary environment variables, such as `MACHINES` and `TARGETS`, and defaults to specific test targets if not set. The script iterates over specified machines, building the project and executing various test suites, including unit tests, fuzz tests, and script tests. It also supports optional coverage data export using `llvm-cov` and can generate a coverage report if the `COV_REPORT` variable is set. The script warns that running it will delete the current build directory, indicating its role in preparing a clean environment for each test run.
