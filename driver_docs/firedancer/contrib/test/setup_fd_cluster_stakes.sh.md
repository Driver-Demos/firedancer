Shell script to set up Solana cluster stakes and vote accounts using keypairs.

# Purpose
This script is a Bash executable that automates the setup and management of Solana blockchain accounts and transactions. It is designed to be executed in a Unix-like environment and uses the `set -euxo pipefail` command to ensure that the script exits immediately if a command fails, and to provide detailed error messages. The script changes the directory to `../test-ledger`, indicating that it operates within a specific testing environment.

The script generates key pairs for identity, stake, vote, and withdrawer accounts using the `solana-keygen` command. These key pairs are stored in JSON files. The script then performs a series of Solana blockchain operations using the `solana` command-line tool. It transfers tokens to the identity accounts, creates vote and stake accounts, and delegates stakes to vote accounts. The operations are repeated for two sets of accounts, suggesting a setup for multiple test scenarios or entities.

The script uses environment variables such as `RPC_URL` and `AGAVE_PATH` to configure the Solana RPC endpoint and the path to the Solana binaries, respectively. This allows for flexibility in different environments. The script concludes with additional key pair generation, but these are not followed by further operations, indicating that they might be intended for future use or additional testing scenarios.
# Global Variables

---
### RPC\_URL
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: Contains the URL for the RPC (Remote Procedure Call) endpoint used to interact with the Solana blockchain. The URL is set to 'http://localhost:8899/', indicating that the RPC server is running locally on port 8899.
- **Use**: Used to specify the RPC endpoint for Solana CLI commands to connect to the local Solana blockchain.


---
### AGAVE\_PATH
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: Defines the file path to the Agave executable directory. If the environment variable `AGAVE_PATH` is not set, it defaults to './agave/target/release'. This path is used to execute various Solana-related commands.
- **Use**: Used to specify the directory path for executing Solana command-line tools.
