A shell script to run and log results of various unit tests for the Firedancer project.

# Purpose
This script is a Bash executable designed to complement automatic unit tests by executing a series of test programs and logging their outputs. It expects the environment variables `OBJDIR` and `MACHINE` to be set, which it uses to locate the binary and unit test directories. The script creates a log directory specified by `LOG_PATH`, runs various unit test executables from the `UNIT_TEST` directory, and redirects their outputs to corresponding log files. It includes tests for shared memory control, workspace control, allocation control, and other components, with some tests configured for multi-tile execution. The script also contains commented-out sections for additional tests that require specific system resources or files, indicating areas for future development or troubleshooting.
# Global Variables

### BIN
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: The `BIN` variable is a string that represents the path to the 'bin' directory within the object directory specified by the `OBJDIR` environment variable. It is constructed by appending '/bin' to the value of `OBJDIR`. The script expects `OBJDIR` to be set before execution.
- **Use**: Stores the path to the 'bin' directory for use in executing binaries within the script.


---
### UNIT\_TEST
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: `UNIT_TEST` is a string variable that stores the path to the unit test directory within the object directory specified by `OBJDIR`. It is constructed by appending '/unit-test' to the `OBJDIR` path.
- **Use**: Used to specify the directory path for executing various unit test scripts.


---
### FD\_LOG\_PATH
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: `FD_LOG_PATH` is a global variable that is set to the string "-". It is exported to be available to any subprocesses that the script may invoke.
