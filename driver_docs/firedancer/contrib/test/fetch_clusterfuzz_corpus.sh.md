Downloads and extracts the latest ClusterFuzz corpus from Google Cloud Storage.

# Purpose
This script is a Bash executable that downloads the latest ClusterFuzz corpus from a Google Cloud Storage bucket. It removes any existing local `corpus` directory and then lists directories in the specified Google Cloud Storage path. For each directory, it extracts the target name, creates a corresponding directory structure locally, and downloads the latest corpus zip file. The script then unzips the contents into a temporary directory and moves the files into the appropriate local corpus directory, cleaning up temporary files and directories afterward. The script is marked as destructive because it deletes the existing `corpus` directory before downloading new data.
