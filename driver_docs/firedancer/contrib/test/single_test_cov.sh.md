Generates a coverage report for a single test using Clang, LLVM, and Lcov.

# Purpose
This script is a Bash executable that generates a code coverage report for a single test using Clang, LLVM, and Lcov. It requires the test binary to be compiled with coverage instrumentation and uses `llvm-profdata` and `llvm-cov` to process the coverage data. The script first executes the test binary while collecting profiling data into a `default.profraw` file. It then merges this data into a `default.profdata` file and exports the coverage information in the Lcov format to `default.lcov`. Finally, it generates an HTML report in the `./report` directory using `genhtml`, providing a visual representation of the code coverage.
# Global Variables

---
### BINARY
- **Type**: ``string``
- **Description**: The `BINARY` variable is a string that stores the first argument passed to the script. It represents the path to the binary executable that is being tested for code coverage.
- **Use**: Used to specify the binary executable for which the coverage report is generated.


---
### COMMAND
- **Type**: ``string``
- **Description**: `COMMAND` is a global variable that stores the entire command-line input given to the script, including the script name and all arguments. It is initialized with the special parameter `$@`, which represents all the positional parameters passed to the script.
- **Use**: Stores the command-line input to be evaluated for generating a coverage report.
