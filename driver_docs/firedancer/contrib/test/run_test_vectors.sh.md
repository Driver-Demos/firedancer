A shell script to run test vectors with parallelism and manage repository setup for the Firedancer project.

# Purpose
This script is a Bash shell script used to automate the setup and execution of a testing environment for a software project. It begins by setting up the working directory and defining several environment variables, such as `OBJDIR`, `NUM_PROCESSES`, `PAGE_SZ`, and `PAGE_CNT`, which control the build configuration and parallel processing parameters. The script checks if a `LOG_PATH` is specified, creating a temporary directory if not, and ensures the existence of a `dump` directory. It then clones or updates a Git repository containing test vectors, using a specific commit reference stored in a file. The script sets up the environment for running compatibility tests using the `SOL_COMPAT` array, which includes the path to the test executable and CPU allocation settings. Finally, it executes the tests on various fixture directories and logs the results, indicating success upon completion.
