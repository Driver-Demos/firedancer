Shell script to execute GDB with a specific Python script sourced.

# Purpose
The script is a shell script that executes the GNU Debugger (`gdb`) with a specific initialization command. It sources the `fd_gdb.py` script located in the `contrib/gdb` directory. This setup is intended to extend or customize the debugging environment by loading additional Python-based debugging utilities or configurations. The script passes any arguments it receives directly to `gdb`, allowing for flexible use in various debugging scenarios.
