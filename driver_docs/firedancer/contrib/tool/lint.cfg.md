Configuration settings for the Uncrustify code beautifier, specifying tab sizes, spacing, and alignment rules.

# Purpose
This configuration file is used to set formatting rules for a codebase, likely for a code beautifier or linter tool. It specifies various parameters that control how the tool processes and formats code, such as tab sizes (`input_tab_size` and `output_tab_size`), comment markers for disabling and enabling processing (`disable_processing_cmt` and `enable_processing_cmt`), and spacing rules around different syntax elements (e.g., `sp_after_type`, `sp_before_semi`). The file also includes settings for indentation (`indent_columns`, `indent_with_tabs`), alignment of code elements (`align_func_params`, `align_var_def_span`), and handling of specific code constructs like macros and comments (`align_nl_cont`, `cmt_indent_multi`). These configurations ensure consistent code style and readability across the codebase by defining how the tool should modify or maintain the code's structure and appearance.
# Content Summary
The provided configuration file is for Uncrustify, a code formatting tool. This file specifies various formatting rules and options that control how Uncrustify processes and formats code. Below are the key functional details:

1. **Tab and Indentation Settings**:
   - `input_tab_size` and `output_tab_size` are set to 2, indicating the size of tabs in both input and output.
   - `indent_columns` is set to 2, specifying the number of columns to indent per level.
   - `indent_with_tabs` is set to 0, meaning spaces are used exclusively for indentation.
   - `indent_single_after_return` is true, indicating that tokens after a return statement are indented with regular single indentation.

2. **Comment Processing**:
   - `disable_processing_cmt` and `enable_processing_cmt` are set to "*LINT-OFF*" and "*LINT-ON*", respectively, to mark sections of code where processing should be disabled or re-enabled.

3. **Spacing Rules**:
   - Various spacing options such as `sp_after_type`, `sp_before_semi`, `sp_after_semi_for`, `sp_before_vardef_square`, `sp_before_comma`, and `sp_not` are set to ignore, meaning no specific action is taken to add or remove spaces in these contexts.
   - `sp_skip_vbrace_tokens` is true, indicating that vbrace tokens are dropped to the previous token and skipped.

4. **Alignment Options**:
   - `align_keep_extra_space`, `align_func_params`, and `align_nl_cont` are true, enabling the alignment of extra spaces, function parameters, and macros with newlines.
   - `align_var_def_span`, `align_var_def_thresh`, `align_var_struct_span`, and `align_typedef_span` specify the span and threshold for aligning variable definitions, struct/union members, and typedefs.

5. **Modification and Preprocessing**:
   - `mod_remove_extra_semicolon` is true, allowing the removal of unnecessary semicolons.
   - `pp_ignore_define_body` is true, indicating that the body of `#define` statements is ignored during formatting.
   - `use_indent_func_call_param` is false, meaning `indent_func_call_param` is not used.

6. **Comment Indentation**:
   - `cmt_indent_multi` is false, indicating that changes to multi-line comments, such as indentation and keyword substitution, are not applied.

These settings collectively define how Uncrustify will format code, focusing on indentation, spacing, alignment, and comment processing.
