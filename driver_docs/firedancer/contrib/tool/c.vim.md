Syntax highlighting for Firedancer style code in Vim, including constants, types, operators, and logging.

# Purpose
This file configures syntax highlighting for a text editor, specifically for Firedancer style code, by defining keywords and their associated syntax groups in Vim. It categorizes various elements of the code into groups such as `cConstant`, `cType`, `cOperator`, `cStorageClass`, and `cStatement`, which are used to highlight different components like versioning, build targets, primitive types, compiler tricks, optimizer hints, atomic operations, logging, and testing. Each category contains specific keywords that are relevant to the Firedancer codebase, allowing developers to easily identify and differentiate between constants, types, operators, and other elements within the code. This enhances code readability and helps developers quickly understand the structure and functionality of the code they are working with.
# Content Summary
This file is a Vim syntax configuration script designed to add syntax highlighting for Firedancer style code in C language files. Developers should add this script to their `~/.vim/after/syntax/c.vim` file to enable the highlighting.

Key technical details include:

1. **Versioning**: The script highlights version-related constants such as `FD_VERSION_MAJOR`, `FD_VERSION_MINOR`, and `FD_VERSION_PATCH`.

2. **Build Target**: It highlights constants that indicate build capabilities, such as `FD_HAS_HOSTED`, `FD_HAS_ATOMIC`, and `FD_HAS_THREADS`.

3. **Base Development Environment**: Constants like `SHORT_MIN`, `SHORT_MAX`, and `USHORT_MAX` are highlighted to represent base environment limits.

4. **Primitive Types**: The script highlights primitive types and their limits, such as `schar`, `uchar`, `int128`, and constants like `INT128_MIN`.

5. **Compiler Tricks**: Various compiler-related operators and storage classes are highlighted, including `FD_STRINGIFY`, `FD_CONCAT2`, and `FD_STATIC_ASSERT`.

6. **Optimizer Hints**: It highlights optimizer-related keywords such as `FD_RESTRICT`, `FD_LIKELY`, and `FD_FN_PURE`.

7. **Atomic Tricks**: The script highlights atomic operation keywords like `FD_ATOMIC_FETCH_AND_ADD` and synchronization constructs like `FD_ONCE_BEGIN`.

8. **Logging**: Logging levels and functions are highlighted, including `FD_LOG_DEBUG` and `FD_LOG_CRIT`.

9. **Testing**: The script highlights the `FD_TEST` operator for testing purposes.

This configuration enhances code readability by visually distinguishing different elements of the Firedancer code style, aiding developers in code navigation and comprehension.
