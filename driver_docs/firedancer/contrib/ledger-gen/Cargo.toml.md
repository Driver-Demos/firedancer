Configuration for the `ledger-gen` package with dependencies on various Solana components.

# Purpose
The `Cargo.toml` file specifies the configuration for a Rust project named `ledger-gen`. It defines the package metadata, including the name, version, and edition of the Rust language to use. The `[dependencies]` section lists the external libraries required by the project, specifying their versions. These dependencies include `dirs-next`, `lazy_static`, and several Solana-related packages such as `solana-sdk`, `solana-bpf-loader-program`, and `solana-client`, among others. The configuration ensures that the correct versions of these libraries are used, and it includes specific features for some dependencies, such as `dev-context-only-utils` for `solana-sdk`.
