Functions for deploying, invoking, upgrading, closing, and redeploying Solana programs with transaction management.

# Purpose
The code provides a set of functions to manage and interact with programs on the Solana blockchain. It includes operations such as deploying, invoking, upgrading, closing, and redeploying programs. The functions use the `RpcClient` to communicate with the Solana network and perform these operations. The code relies on external modules `instructions` and `utils` to handle specific tasks like setting up buffer accounts, creating and signing transactions, and waiting for slots to pass.

Each function in the code serves a specific purpose related to program lifecycle management. For example, `example_commands` demonstrates a sequence of operations including deploying, invoking, upgrading, and closing a program, while `deploy_invoke_same_slot` and `deploy_invoke_diff_slot` focus on deploying and invoking a program within the same or different slots, respectively. The functions use `Keypair` for signing transactions and `Arc<RpcClient>` for shared client access. The code is structured to handle different scenarios of program management on the Solana blockchain, providing a comprehensive interface for developers to automate these tasks.
