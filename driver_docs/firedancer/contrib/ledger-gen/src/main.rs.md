Main function for setting up and managing Solana ledger transactions using RPC clients and keypairs.

# Purpose
This code is a Rust program that interacts with the Solana blockchain. It sets up a connection to a Solana node using the `RpcClient` from the `solana_client` crate, with a specified commitment level. The program reads a keypair file to identify the payer for transactions, which is necessary for signing and sending transactions on the blockchain. The code also includes functionality to read and verify an ELF file, which is likely a compiled Solana program, and prepares account data for transactions.

The program is organized into several modules: `ledgers`, `instructions`, `utils`, `bpf_loader`, `nonce`, and `stake`. These modules are likely responsible for handling different aspects of interacting with the Solana blockchain, such as managing ledgers, creating and sending transactions, and handling specific Solana program instructions. The main function outlines a workflow for creating ledgers, deploying, invoking, upgrading, and closing programs, and sending transactions. The program is intended to be run with a specified payer file, and it provides a framework for executing a sequence of blockchain operations, although the specific ledger functions are commented out and need to be activated for execution.
# Imports and Dependencies

# Functions

---
### main
Sets up the RPC client, reads the payer keypair, and prepares program and account data for ledger operations.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Creates an `RpcClient` with a processed commitment level and an `Arc` wrapped `RpcClient` with a confirmed commitment level, both pointing to a local Solana node.
    - Retrieves the payer file path from the command-line arguments, expecting it in the format 'payer=/path/to/file'.
    - Reads the keypair from the specified payer file path using `read_keypair_file`.
    - Reads and verifies the ELF file 'helloworld.so' to obtain the program data using `utils::read_and_verify_elf`.
    - Initializes a vector `account_data` with four zero bytes.
- **Output**: No output is returned as this is the `main` function of a Rust program.
