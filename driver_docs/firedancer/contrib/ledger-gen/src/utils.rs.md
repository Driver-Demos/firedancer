Utility functions for reading and verifying ELF files, creating and signing transactions, and slot waiting.

# Purpose
This Rust code provides utility functions and configurations for interacting with the Solana blockchain. It includes functions to read and verify an ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) file, create and sign a Solana transaction, and wait for a specified number of slots on the blockchain. The `read_and_verify_elf` function reads an ELF file from a given location, verifies it using the Solana BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter) loader program, and returns the program data if successful. The `create_message_and_sign` function constructs a Solana transaction message from a list of instructions, signs it with the provided keypairs, and returns the signed transaction. The `wait_atleast_n_slots` function pauses execution until the blockchain has advanced by a specified number of slots, using the `RpcClient` to query the current slot.

Additionally, the code defines a static configuration `SKIP_PREFLIGHT_CONFIG` using the `lazy_static` macro. This configuration is used to skip preflight checks when sending transactions, which can be useful for testing or specific use cases where preflight checks are not necessary. The code imports several modules from the Solana ecosystem, such as `solana_client`, `solana_sdk`, and `solana_rbpf`, indicating its reliance on Solana's libraries for blockchain interaction and program execution. This code is likely intended to be part of a larger application or library that interacts with the Solana blockchain, providing essential functions for program verification, transaction creation, and blockchain synchronization.

# Functions

---
### create\_message\_and\_sign
Creates a Solana transaction message from given instructions, signs it with specified keypairs, and returns the signed transaction.
- **Inputs**:
    - `instructions`: A reference to a vector of `Instruction` objects that define the operations to include in the transaction.
    - `payer`: A reference to a `Keypair` that represents the payer of the transaction fees.
    - `signers`: A vector of references to `Keypair` objects that will sign the transaction.
    - `blockhash`: A `Hash` representing the recent blockhash to use for the transaction.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Creates a `Message` object using the provided instructions, payer's public key, and blockhash.
    - Initializes an unsigned `Transaction` with the created message.
    - Attempts to sign the transaction with the provided signers and blockhash.
    - Returns the signed `Transaction`.
- **Output**: A `Transaction` object that is signed and ready to be sent to the Solana network.

### read\_and\_verify\_elf
Reads an ELF file from a specified location and verifies its integrity using a program runtime environment.
- **Inputs**:
    - `program_location`: A string slice that specifies the file path of the ELF program to read and verify.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Open the file at the specified `program_location` and handle any errors that occur during this process.
    - Read the entire contents of the file into a `Vec<u8>` and handle any errors that occur during this process.
    - Create a program runtime environment using `create_program_runtime_environment_v1` with all features enabled and a default compute budget.
    - Create an `Executable` from the ELF data using the program runtime environment and handle any errors that occur during this process.
    - Verify the `Executable` using `RequisiteVerifier` and handle any errors that occur during this process.
    - Return the program data as a `Vec<u8>` if all operations succeed.
- **Output**: Returns a `Result` containing a `Vec<u8>` with the program data if successful, or an error message encapsulated in a `Box<dyn std::error::Error>` if any step fails.


---
### wait\_atleast\_n\_slots
Waits until the blockchain reaches at least a specified number of slots beyond the current slot.
- **Inputs**:
    - `client`: An `RpcClient` instance used to interact with the Solana blockchain.
    - `n`: A `u64` integer representing the number of slots to wait beyond the current slot.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Get the current slot from the blockchain using the `client.get_slot()` method.
    - Calculate the `target_slot` by adding `n` to the `current_slot`.
    - Enter a loop that continuously gets the current slot from the blockchain.
    - Check if the current slot is greater than or equal to the `target_slot`.
    - Break the loop if the current slot is greater than or equal to the `target_slot`.
- **Output**: No output is returned; the function waits until the condition is met.
