Creates and manages Solana nonce accounts using RPC client interactions and transaction handling.

# Purpose
The code defines a function `create_nonce_account` that interacts with the Solana blockchain to create and manage nonce accounts. It uses the `RpcClient` to communicate with the Solana network and perform operations such as fetching the latest blockhash, sending transactions, and confirming them. The function first creates a nonce account using instructions from the `instructions` module and signs the transaction with the provided `payer` keypair. It then retrieves and prints the nonce blockhash from the initialized nonce account.

The function also demonstrates how to open a new account with a minimum balance for rent exemption, using the nonce account for transaction signing. It includes logic to wait for a certain number of slots to pass, ensuring that the nonce blockhash is updated before sending further transactions. The code uses utility functions from the `utils` module to handle message creation, signing, and waiting for slot confirmations. This function is part of a broader system that manages nonce accounts and transactions on the Solana blockchain.

# Functions

---
### create\_nonce\_account
Creates a nonce account and performs transactions using the Solana blockchain client.
- **Inputs**:
    - `client`: An `RpcClient` instance used to interact with the Solana blockchain.
    - `payer`: A `Keypair` instance representing the payer of the transaction fees.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Get the latest blockhash from the `client`.
    - Call `instructions::create_nonce_account_instructions` to get the nonce account and instructions for creating it.
    - Create and sign a transaction with the nonce account creation instructions and send it using the `client`.
    - Print the created nonce account's public key and the current slot.
    - Retrieve the nonce blockhash from the initialized nonce account state.
    - Create a new keypair for a new account.
    - Get the minimum balance required for rent exemption for a nonce account.
    - Create an account creation instruction for the new account with the minimum balance and system program ID.
    - Create a message with the nonce and sign it with the payer and new account keypairs.
    - Send and confirm the transaction using the `client`.
    - Print the opened account's public key.
    - Wait for at least two slots to pass using `utils::wait_atleast_n_slots`.
    - Repeat the process of retrieving the nonce blockhash, creating a new account, and sending a transaction.
    - Print the transaction details and wait for at least two slots again.
    - Retrieve and print the nonce blockhash again.
- **Output**: No return value; the function performs actions on the Solana blockchain and prints information to the console.
