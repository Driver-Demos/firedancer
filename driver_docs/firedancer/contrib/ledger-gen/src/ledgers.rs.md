Functions for deploying, upgrading, and managing BPF programs and stakes on Solana using RPC clients.

# Purpose
The code defines two primary functions, `bpf_loader_ledger` and `stake_ledger`, which interact with the Solana blockchain using the `RpcClient` and `Keypair` from the Solana SDK. The `bpf_loader_ledger` function manages the deployment, upgrade, and closure of programs on the blockchain using the BPF loader. It calls several functions from the `bpf_loader` module to perform these operations in both the same and different slots, indicating a focus on managing program lifecycle events on the blockchain. The function requires a client, an arc-wrapped client, a payer keypair, and vectors of program and account data as inputs.

The `stake_ledger` function is responsible for managing staking operations on the blockchain. It uses the `stake` module to move lamports, which are the smallest unit of currency in Solana, from one account to another. The function takes a client and a payer keypair as parameters. The code is structured to be part of a larger system, as indicated by the use of modules like `bpf_loader` and `stake`, which are imported from the same crate. The presence of commented-out code suggests that additional functionality, such as moving stakes, may be implemented or modified in the future.

# Functions

---
### bpf\_loader\_ledger
Executes a series of BPF loader operations on a Solana blockchain client.
- **Inputs**:
    - `client`: A reference to an `RpcClient` instance used to interact with the Solana blockchain.
    - `arc_client`: An `Arc` wrapped reference to an `RpcClient` instance, allowing for shared ownership and thread-safe access.
    - `payer`: A reference to a `Keypair` used to authorize transactions on the blockchain.
    - `program_data`: A reference to a vector of bytes representing the program data to be deployed or upgraded.
    - `account_data`: A reference to a vector of bytes representing the account data associated with the program.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Calls `bpf_loader::deploy_invoke_same_slot` with the provided arguments to deploy the program in the same slot.
    - Calls `bpf_loader::deploy_invoke_diff_slot` to deploy the program in a different slot.
    - Calls `bpf_loader::upgrade_invoke_same_slot` to upgrade the program in the same slot.
    - Calls `bpf_loader::upgrade_invoke_diff_slot` to upgrade the program in a different slot.
    - Calls `bpf_loader::deploy_close_same_slot` to close the deployment in the same slot.
    - Calls `bpf_loader::deploy_close_diff_slot` to close the deployment in a different slot.
    - Calls `bpf_loader::close_invoke_same_slot` to close the invocation in the same slot.
    - Calls `bpf_loader::close_invoke_diff_slot` to close the invocation in a different slot.
    - Calls `bpf_loader::close_redeploy_same_slot` to close and redeploy in the same slot.
    - Calls `bpf_loader::close_redeploy_diff_slot` to close and redeploy in a different slot.
- **Output**: No return value; the function performs operations on the blockchain client.

### stake\_ledger
Transfers lamports using the provided RPC client and payer keypair.
- **Inputs**:
    - `client`: An `RpcClient` instance used to interact with the Solana blockchain.
    - `payer`: A `Keypair` representing the payer's credentials for transaction signing.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Calls the `stake::move_lamports` function with the `client` and `payer` arguments.
- **Output**: No return value.
