Functions for creating, moving, and delegating Solana stake accounts using RPC client interactions.

# Purpose
The code provides functionality for managing Solana stake accounts and transferring lamports and stakes between them. It defines two main functions: `move_lamports` and `move_stake`. Both functions use the `RpcClient` to interact with the Solana blockchain and require a `Keypair` for authorization. The `move_lamports` function creates two stake accounts and transfers a specified amount of lamports from one account to another. The `move_stake` function also creates two stake accounts, delegates the stake of the first account to a voter account, and then transfers a specified amount of stake from the first account to the second account.

The code imports several modules from the Solana SDK and client libraries, which provide the necessary tools and structures for creating and managing stake accounts, signing transactions, and interacting with the blockchain. The `utils` module is used to create and sign transactions, and to wait for a certain number of slots to pass. The code is structured to be part of a larger application, likely a script or a library, that manages Solana stake accounts. It does not define public APIs or external interfaces, but rather provides specific operations related to stake management on the Solana blockchain.

# Functions

---
### move\_lamports
Transfers a specified amount of lamports from one stake account to another using the Solana blockchain.
- **Inputs**:
    - `client`: An `RpcClient` instance used to interact with the Solana blockchain.
    - `payer`: A `Keypair` representing the account that pays for the transactions.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Create a new `Keypair` for the `from_stake_account`.
    - Define `authorized` with the `staker` and `withdrawer` set to the `payer`'s public key.
    - Create a `create_from_stake_account_instruction` to initialize the `from_stake_account` with 1,000,000,000 lamports.
    - Create and sign a transaction with `create_from_stake_account_instruction` and send it using the `client`.
    - Print the creation of the `from_stake_account` with its public key and current slot.
    - Create a new `Keypair` for the `to_stake_account`.
    - Create a `create_to_stake_account_instruction` to initialize the `to_stake_account` with 1,000,000,000 lamports.
    - Create and sign a transaction with `create_to_stake_account_instruction` and send it using the `client`.
    - Print the creation of the `to_stake_account` with its public key and current slot.
    - Create a `move_lamports_instruction` to transfer 10,000,000 lamports from `from_stake_account` to `to_stake_account`.
    - Create and sign a transaction with `move_lamports_instruction` and send it using the `client`.
    - Print the transfer of lamports from `from_stake_account` to `to_stake_account` with their public keys and current slot.
- **Output**: None

### move\_stake
Transfers stake from one account to another and delegates it to a voter account.
- **Inputs**:
    - `client`: An `RpcClient` instance used to interact with the Solana blockchain.
    - `payer`: A `Keypair` representing the account that pays for the transactions.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Create a new `Keypair` for the `from_stake_account`.
    - Define `authorized` with the `staker` and `withdrawer` set to the `payer`'s public key.
    - Create a stake account for `from_stake_account` with 1,000,000,000 lamports using `create_account_checked`.
    - Sign and send the transaction to create the `from_stake_account`.
    - Read the `voter` keypair from a file.
    - Delegate the stake of `from_stake_account` to the `voter` using `delegate_stake`.
    - Sign and send the transaction to delegate the stake.
    - Create a new `Keypair` for the `to_stake_account`.
    - Create a stake account for `to_stake_account` with 1,000,000,000 lamports using `create_account_checked`.
    - Sign and send the transaction to create the `to_stake_account`.
    - Wait for at least 1000 slots using `wait_atleast_n_slots`.
    - Move 100,000,000 lamports from `from_stake_account` to `to_stake_account` using `move_stake`.
    - Sign and send the transaction to move the stake.
- **Output**: None; the function performs actions on the blockchain and prints status messages.
