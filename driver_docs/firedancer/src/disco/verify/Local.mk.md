Makefile for building and testing components with conditional logic based on FD_HAS_ALLOCA.

# Purpose
The `Makefile` snippet conditionally includes and runs unit tests based on the presence of the `FD_HAS_ALLOCA` flag. If the flag is defined, it adds object files `fd_verify_tile` and `fd_disco` to the build process. It also defines and runs unit tests `test_verify` and `test_verify_tile`, which depend on the modules `fd_ballet`, `fd_tango`, `fd_util`, and `fd_disco`.
