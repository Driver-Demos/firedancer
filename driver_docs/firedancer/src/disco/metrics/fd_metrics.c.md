Defines thread-local variables for metrics in the Firedancer codebase.

# Purpose
The code is a simple C header file that declares two thread-local variables. The first variable, `fd_metrics_base_tl`, is a pointer to an unsigned long integer (`ulong`). The second variable, `fd_metrics_tl`, is a pointer to a volatile unsigned long integer (`volatile ulong`). These variables are likely used to store and access metrics data in a thread-local manner, ensuring that each thread has its own instance of these variables. The inclusion of the header file `fd_metrics.h` suggests that these variables are part of a larger metrics tracking or monitoring system.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `fd_metrics.h`


# Global Variables

---
### fd\_metrics\_base\_tl
- **Type**: ``ulong *``
- **Description**: A pointer to an unsigned long integer, used to store or reference a base address for metrics data.
- **Use**: Used to point to the base address of metrics data in a thread-local storage context.


---
### fd\_metrics\_tl
- **Type**: ``FD_TL volatile ulong *``
- **Description**: A pointer to a volatile unsigned long integer, which is part of the `FD_TL` thread-local storage mechanism. The `volatile` keyword indicates that the value pointed to by this pointer can be changed at any time, potentially by external processes or hardware, and thus should not be optimized by the compiler.
- **Use**: Used to access or modify thread-local metrics data in a concurrent environment.
