Defines security policies for logging and serving HTTP metrics using file descriptors.

# Purpose
This configuration file defines the behavior of a server application that logs messages and serves HTTP pages. It specifies file descriptors for logging and metrics, with `logfile_fd` for writing log messages and `metrics_socket_fd` for handling HTTP connections. The file outlines rules for logging, where messages of 'WARNING' level and above are written to STDERR and fsynced to disk. It also details the server's operations, such as accepting, reading from, writing to, and closing client connections, while excluding certain file descriptors like the log file, STDOUT, and the listening socket. The configuration ensures that the server can manage connections efficiently while maintaining a clear separation between logging and HTTP serving functionalities.
# Content Summary
This configuration file defines the behavior of logging and server operations for a software system that serves HTTP pages and logs messages. The file specifies the use of file descriptors for logging and server connections.

1. **Logging Configuration:**
   - `logfile_fd` and `metrics_socket_fd` are unsigned integer file descriptors. `logfile_fd` is used for writing log messages to a file, while `metrics_socket_fd` is used for serving a Prometheus-compatible HTTP endpoint.
   - Log messages are written to a file and/or a pipe. Messages with a severity of 'WARNING' and above are written to STDERR (file descriptor 2), while all messages are written to the log file (file descriptor 4).
   - The `fsync` operation ensures that log messages of 'WARNING' level and above are immediately synchronized to disk using the `logfile_fd`.

2. **Server Configuration:**
   - The server accepts connections over HTTP using the `accept4` function. It listens on the `metrics_socket_fd` and uses specific socket options (`SOCK_CLOEXEC|SOCK_NONBLOCK`).
   - The server reads from and writes to connected client sockets. It allows any file descriptor for these operations except those known not to be client connections, specifically the log file, STDOUT, and the listening socket.
   - The `read`, `sendto`, and `close` operations are restricted to file descriptors that are not the log file, STDOUT, or the listening socket, ensuring they are only used for client connections.
   - The `ppoll` operation is used for polling connections, although specific details are not provided in the file.

This configuration ensures that logging and server operations are correctly managed, with specific file descriptors designated for logging and client connections.
