Defines potential metrics for Firedancer, grouped into categories, with guidelines for maintaining backward compatibility.

# Purpose
The file defines a comprehensive set of metrics for the Firedancer system, organized into various categories and tiles. Each tile represents a specific component or aspect of the system, such as network interfaces, transaction processing, or QUIC connections. Within each tile, metrics are defined using counters, gauges, and histograms, which track various performance and operational statistics. These metrics are crucial for monitoring system performance, diagnosing issues, and ensuring backward compatibility. The file also includes enumerations that categorize specific metric values, providing detailed context for interpreting the data collected. This structured approach allows for precise tracking and analysis of system behavior, facilitating effective management and optimization of the Firedancer system.
# Content Summary
The provided file is a configuration document that defines various metrics for the Firedancer software. These metrics are organized into categories, each represented by a `<tile>` element, and are used to monitor and report on different aspects of the system's performance and behavior. The document specifies counters, gauges, histograms, and enumerations to capture and describe these metrics.

Key components of the file include:

1. **Metrics Categories**: Metrics are grouped into categories such as `linkin`, `linkout`, `common`, `net`, `sock`, `quic`, `send`, `bundle`, `verify`, `dedup`, `resolf`, `resolv`, `pack`, `bankf`, `bank`, `poh`, `shred`, `store`, `replay`, `repair`, `gossip`, `gossvf`, `sign`, `netlnk`, `snapct`, `snapld`, `snapdc`, `snapin`, `metric`, `ipecho`, `backt`, and `exec`. Each category contains specific metrics relevant to its function.

2. **Metric Types**:
   - **Counters**: These track the number of occurrences of specific events, such as `ConsumedCount`, `RxPktCnt`, and `TxSubmitCnt`.
   - **Gauges**: These provide a snapshot of a value at a given time, such as `Pid`, `Tid`, and `Status`.
   - **Histograms**: These measure the distribution of values over a range, such as `ServiceDurationSeconds` and `ReceiveDurationSeconds`.

3. **Enumerations**: The file defines several enumerations to categorize and label specific metric values. Examples include `TileRegime`, `SockErr`, `TpuRecvType`, `QuicFrameType`, `TransactionError`, and `GossipMessage`.

4. **Backward Compatibility**: The document emphasizes that metrics must remain backward compatible. Existing metric names should not be changed; instead, they should be deprecated, and new metrics should be introduced.

5. **Metric Descriptions**: Each metric is accompanied by a `summary` attribute that provides a brief description of what the metric measures or represents.

6. **Exclusion from Clickhouse**: Some metrics, such as `Pid` and `Tid`, are marked with `clickhouse_exclude="true"`, indicating they should not be included in Clickhouse database exports.

This configuration file is essential for developers and system administrators to understand and monitor the performance and operational status of the Firedancer software. It provides a structured approach to collecting and reporting metrics, ensuring that the system's behavior can be analyzed and optimized effectively.
