Defines macros and structures for metric types, converters, and metadata in the Firedancer codebase.

# Purpose
The code is a C header file that defines macros and a data structure for managing metrics in a software system. It provides a framework for defining different types of metrics, such as gauges, counters, and histograms, which are commonly used for performance monitoring and data collection. The file includes macros like `DECLARE_METRIC`, `DECLARE_METRIC_ENUM`, and `DECLARE_METRIC_HISTOGRAM_NONE` to facilitate the declaration of metrics with specific attributes such as name, type, description, offset, and conversion type.

The `fd_metrics_meta_t` structure is central to this file, encapsulating metadata for each metric, including its name, type, description, and offset. It also supports different conversion types and histogram configurations through a union. The file includes a static inline function [`fd_metrics_meta_type_str`](<#fd_metrics_meta_type_str>) that returns a string representation of the metric type, aiding in the interpretation of metric data. This header file is intended to be included in other C source files to provide a standardized way to define and manage metrics within the application.

# Data Structures

---
### fd\_metrics\_meta\_t
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `name`: Pointer to a constant character string that holds the name of the metric.
    - `enum_name`: Pointer to a constant character string that holds the name of the enumeration.
    - `enum_variant`: Pointer to a constant character string that holds the variant of the enumeration.
    - `type`: Integer that specifies the type of the metric.
    - `desc`: Pointer to a constant character string that holds the description of the metric.
    - `offset`: Unsigned long integer that specifies the offset of the metric.
    - `converter`: Integer that specifies the converter type for the metric.
    - `histogram`: Union that contains histogram-specific data, including nested unions for different histogram types.
- **Description**: Defines metadata for a metric, including its name, type, description, and offset, as well as specific data for histogram metrics through nested unions.


# Functions

### fd\_metrics\_meta\_type\_str<!-- {{#callable:fd_metrics_meta_type_str}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/disco/metrics/fd_metrics_base.h#L93>)

Returns a string representation of the metric type based on the `type` field of the `fd_metrics_meta_t` structure.
- **Inputs**:
    - `metric`: A pointer to a constant `fd_metrics_meta_t` structure that contains the metric information.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Check the `type` field of the `metric` structure.
    - If `type` is `FD_METRICS_TYPE_GAUGE`, return the string "gauge".
    - If `type` is `FD_METRICS_TYPE_COUNTER`, return the string "counter".
    - If `type` is `FD_METRICS_TYPE_HISTOGRAM`, return the string "histogram".
    - If `type` does not match any known type, return the string "unknown".
- **Output**: A string that represents the type of the metric, such as "gauge", "counter", "histogram", or "unknown".
