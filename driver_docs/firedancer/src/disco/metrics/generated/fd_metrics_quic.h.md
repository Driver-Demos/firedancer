Defines metrics for QUIC transactions, including counters and gauges for various QUIC operations and states.

# Purpose
The file `fd_metrics_quic.h` is a C header file that defines a set of metrics related to QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections) protocol operations. It is generated by a script (`gen_metrics.py`) and should not be manually edited. The file includes definitions for various metrics counters and gauges, which are used to track different aspects of QUIC transactions and connections. These metrics include counts of transactions received, packets sent and received, connection states, and errors encountered during QUIC operations. Each metric is defined with an offset, name, type, description, and a conversion type, which are used to facilitate the monitoring and analysis of QUIC protocol performance.

The file serves as a part of a larger metrics collection framework, as indicated by its inclusion of base metrics headers (`fd_metrics_base.h` and `fd_metrics_enums.h`). The metrics are categorized into counters, gauges, and histograms, each serving a specific purpose in tracking the performance and reliability of QUIC connections. For example, counters track the number of transactions or packets, gauges monitor the current state of connections, and histograms measure the duration of specific operations. The file also defines external interfaces, such as the `FD_METRICS_QUIC` array, which provides metadata for the defined metrics. This header file is intended to be included in other C source files that require access to QUIC metrics for performance monitoring and debugging purposes.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `../fd_metrics_base.h`
- `fd_metrics_enums.h`


# Global Variables

---
### FD\_METRICS\_QUIC
- **Type**: ``fd_metrics_meta_t` array`
- **Description**: An array of `fd_metrics_meta_t` structures that contains metadata for various QUIC metrics. Each element in the array represents a specific metric related to QUIC operations, such as transaction counts, connection states, and packet statistics.
- **Use**: Used to store and access metadata for QUIC-related metrics in the system.
