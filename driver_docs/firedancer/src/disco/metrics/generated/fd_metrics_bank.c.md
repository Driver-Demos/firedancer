Defines a set of metrics for bank transaction processing, including various error and success counters.

# Purpose
The code defines a set of metrics related to bank transactions, which are used for monitoring and analysis purposes. It is a C source file that initializes an array of `fd_metrics_meta_t` structures, named `FD_METRICS_BANK`, with various metrics. These metrics are categorized as counters and are used to track different outcomes and errors that can occur during bank transactions. The metrics include transaction sanitization failures, execution failures, and various specific transaction errors such as insufficient funds, invalid accounts, and signature failures.

The file is generated automatically by a script (`gen_metrics.py`) and should not be manually edited. It includes metrics that are declared using macros like `DECLARE_METRIC` and `DECLARE_METRIC_ENUM`, which likely expand to define the structure and properties of each metric. The metrics cover a wide range of transaction-related events, from successful executions to specific error conditions, providing a comprehensive set of data points for transaction monitoring. The file is intended to be included in other parts of a larger system, where these metrics can be used to track and analyze the performance and issues related to bank transactions.

### FD\_METRICS\_BANK
- **Type**: ``const fd_metrics_meta_t[]``
- **Description**: An array of `fd_metrics_meta_t` structures that defines various metrics related to bank transactions. Each element in the array represents a specific metric, such as transaction failures, execution results, and errors, using the `DECLARE_METRIC` and `DECLARE_METRIC_ENUM` macros.
- **Use**: Used to store and manage metrics for bank transaction processing and error tracking.
