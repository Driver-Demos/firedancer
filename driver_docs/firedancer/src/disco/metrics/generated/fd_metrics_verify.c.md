Defines an array of metrics for transaction verification failures as counters.

# Purpose
This code is a C source file that defines an array of metric metadata for verification processes. The array `FD_METRICS_VERIFY` is of type `fd_metrics_meta_t` and contains a list of metrics related to transaction verification, such as `VERIFY_TRANSACTION_BUNDLE_PEER_FAILURE`, `VERIFY_TRANSACTION_PARSE_FAILURE`, `VERIFY_TRANSACTION_DEDUP_FAILURE`, and `VERIFY_TRANSACTION_VERIFY_FAILURE`. Each metric is declared using the `DECLARE_METRIC` macro with a type of `COUNTER`, indicating that these metrics are intended to count occurrences of specific verification failures. The file includes the header `fd_metrics_verify.h`, which likely contains necessary declarations and definitions for the metrics system. The file is automatically generated by a script named `gen_metrics.py`, and manual edits are not recommended.

### FD\_METRICS\_VERIFY
- **Type**: ``fd_metrics_meta_t` array`
- **Description**: An array of `fd_metrics_meta_t` structures that define metrics related to transaction verification failures. Each element in the array is initialized using the `DECLARE_METRIC` macro with a specific failure type and a `COUNTER` metric type.
- **Use**: Used to store and manage metrics for different types of transaction verification failures.
