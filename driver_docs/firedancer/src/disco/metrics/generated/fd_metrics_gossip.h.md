Defines constants and metadata for gossip-related metrics in the Firedancer codebase.

# Purpose
The code is a C header file that defines a set of metrics related to a gossip protocol. It is generated by a script named `gen_metrics.py` and should not be manually edited. The file includes definitions for various metrics counters and gauges, which are used to track different aspects of the gossip protocol's operation. These metrics include capacities, counts, and results related to ping tracking, CRDS (Conflict-free Replicated Data Structures), peer interactions, and message transmissions.

Each metric is defined with a set of attributes, including an offset, name, type, description, and converter. The metrics are categorized into counters and gauges, with specific metrics tracking events such as ping tracker capacity, CRDS counts, message transmission counts, and peer-related statistics. The file also declares an external array `FD_METRICS_GOSSIP` that holds metadata for these metrics, indicating that this header is part of a larger system where these metrics are used for monitoring and analysis of the gossip protocol's performance.
# Imports and Dependencies

### FD\_METRICS\_GOSSIP
- **Type**: ``fd_metrics_meta_t` array`
- **Description**: An array of `fd_metrics_meta_t` structures, `FD_METRICS_GOSSIP` holds metadata for various gossip-related metrics. The array size is defined by `FD_METRICS_GOSSIP_TOTAL`, which is 118.
- **Use**: Used to store metadata for gossip metrics, facilitating the tracking and management of these metrics.
