Defines metrics for shred operations, including counters and histograms for various processing results.

# Purpose
The code defines a set of metrics related to a process called "shredding" in a system. It is a C source file that is automatically generated by a script named `gen_metrics.py`, and it should not be manually edited. The file includes the header `fd_metrics_shred.h` and defines an array `FD_METRICS_SHRED` of type `fd_metrics_meta_t`. This array contains various metrics, each declared using macros such as `DECLARE_METRIC`, `DECLARE_METRIC_HISTOGRAM_NONE`, `DECLARE_METRIC_HISTOGRAM_SECONDS`, and `DECLARE_METRIC_ENUM`.

The metrics track different aspects of the shredding process, including counters for events like abandoned microblocks, invalid block IDs, and various outcomes of shred processing. Some metrics are histograms that measure durations in seconds, such as `SHRED_SHREDDING_DURATION_SECONDS` and `SHRED_ADD_SHRED_DURATION_SECONDS`. The use of enums in metrics like `SHRED_SHRED_PROCESSED` allows for categorizing processing results into different states such as `BAD_SLOT`, `PARSE_FAILED`, and `OKAY`. This file is part of a broader system for monitoring and analyzing the shredding process, providing detailed insights into its performance and issues.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `fd_metrics_shred.h`


# Global Variables

---
### FD\_METRICS\_SHRED
- **Type**: ``const fd_metrics_meta_t[]``
- **Description**: An array of `fd_metrics_meta_t` structures that define various metrics related to the shredding process. Each element in the array represents a specific metric, such as counters or histograms, for tracking different aspects of shredding operations.
- **Use**: Used to store and organize metrics for monitoring and analyzing shredding processes.
