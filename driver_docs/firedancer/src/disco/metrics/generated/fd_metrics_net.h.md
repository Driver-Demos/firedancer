Defines network-related metrics counters and gauges for packet transmission and reception.

# Purpose
The code is a C header file that defines a set of network-related metrics for monitoring and diagnostics. It includes a series of preprocessor macros that define offsets, names, types, descriptions, and conversion methods for various network metrics. These metrics are categorized into counters and gauges, which are used to track different aspects of network packet transmission and reception. The counters include metrics such as the number of packets received, bytes transmitted, and packets dropped due to various reasons like undersized packets or full rings. Gauges provide information on the current state of network buffers, indicating how many are busy or idle.

The file is generated by a script (`gen_metrics.py`) and should not be manually edited. It includes references to other header files, such as `fd_metrics_base.h` and `fd_metrics_enums.h`, which likely define base types and enumerations used in the metrics definitions. The file also declares an external array `FD_METRICS_NET` of type `fd_metrics_meta_t`, which holds metadata for the defined metrics. This header file is intended to be included in other C source files that require access to these network metrics, providing a standardized way to monitor network performance and diagnose issues.
# Imports and Dependencies

### FD\_METRICS\_NET
- **Type**: ``fd_metrics_meta_t` array`
- **Description**: `FD_METRICS_NET` is an array of `fd_metrics_meta_t` structures. It contains metadata for various network-related metrics, such as packet counts, byte totals, and error counts. The array is defined with a size of `FD_METRICS_NET_TOTAL`, which is 28.
- **Use**: Used to store and access metadata for network metrics in the application.
