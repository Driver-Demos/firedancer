Defines an array of execution metrics as counters for program cache events.

# Purpose
This file is a C source file that defines an array of `fd_metrics_meta_t` structures named `FD_METRICS_EXEC`. The array contains metric declarations related to program cache execution, such as `EXEC_PROGCACHE_MISSES`, `EXEC_PROGCACHE_HITS`, and others, each associated with a `COUNTER` type. The file includes the header `fd_metrics_exec.h`, which likely contains necessary type definitions and macros like `DECLARE_METRIC`. The file is automatically generated by a script named `gen_metrics.py`, and manual edits are not recommended.
# Imports and Dependencies

### FD\_METRICS\_EXEC
- **Type**: ``fd_metrics_meta_t` array`
- **Description**: An array of `fd_metrics_meta_t` structures, each representing a specific execution metric. The array is initialized with metrics related to program cache operations, such as misses, hits, fills, and invalidations.
- **Use**: Used to store and manage execution metrics for program cache operations.
