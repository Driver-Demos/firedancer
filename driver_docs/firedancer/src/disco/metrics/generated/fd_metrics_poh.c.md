Defines an array of histogram metrics for measuring various delays in the POH process.

# Purpose
This C source code file defines an array of type `fd_metrics_meta_t` named `FD_METRICS_POH`, which contains metric histograms related to Proof of History (PoH) delays. The file includes the header `fd_metrics_poh.h` and uses the macro `DECLARE_METRIC_HISTOGRAM_SECONDS` to declare each metric. The metrics include `POH_BEGIN_LEADER_DELAY_SECONDS`, `POH_FIRST_MICROBLOCK_DELAY_SECONDS`, `POH_SLOT_DONE_DELAY_SECONDS`, and `POH_BUNDLE_INITIALIZE_DELAY_SECONDS`. The file is automatically generated by a script named `gen_metrics.py` and should not be manually edited.

### FD\_METRICS\_POH
- **Type**: ``fd_metrics_meta_t` array`
- **Description**: An array of `fd_metrics_meta_t` structures, each initialized with a metric histogram for different delay times in seconds related to POH (Proof of History) operations. The array size is determined by the `FD_METRICS_POH_TOTAL` constant.
- **Use**: Used to store and manage metrics related to various delay times in POH operations.
