Defines metrics for the Firedancer project, including counters for various resolve operations and results.

# Purpose
This C source file defines an array of metric metadata, `FD_METRICS_RESOLF`, which is used to track various operational metrics. The file is automatically generated and should not be manually edited. It includes metrics related to operations such as stash operations and lookup table resolutions, each defined with a `COUNTER` type. The metrics are declared using macros like `DECLARE_METRIC` and `DECLARE_METRIC_ENUM`, which likely expand to structures or functions that facilitate metric tracking. The file includes a header, `fd_metrics_resolf.h`, which presumably contains necessary declarations or definitions for these macros and types.

### FD\_METRICS\_RESOLF
- **Type**: ``const fd_metrics_meta_t[]``
- **Description**: An array of `fd_metrics_meta_t` structures that define various metrics related to the resolution process. Each element in the array is initialized using macros like `DECLARE_METRIC` and `DECLARE_METRIC_ENUM`, which specify the metric type and its associated counter or enumeration values.
- **Use**: Used to store and manage metrics for different resolution operations and outcomes.
