Defines metrics counters for transaction verification failures, including peer, parse, dedup, and verify errors.

# Purpose
This C header file defines a set of constants and metadata related to transaction verification metrics. It is automatically generated by a script named `gen_metrics.py` and should not be manually edited. The file includes definitions for four specific metrics counters, each representing a different type of transaction verification failure: peer failure, parse failure, deduplication failure, and verification failure. Each metric is associated with an offset, a name, a type, a description, and a converter type, which is set to `FD_METRICS_CONVERTER_NONE`. Additionally, the file declares an external array `FD_METRICS_VERIFY` that holds metadata for these metrics, with a total count defined by `FD_METRICS_VERIFY_TOTAL`.

### FD\_METRICS\_VERIFY
- **Type**: ``fd_metrics_meta_t` array`
- **Description**: An array of `fd_metrics_meta_t` structures that contains metadata for various verification metrics. Each element in the array corresponds to a specific metric related to transaction verification failures, such as peer failure, parse failure, deduplication failure, and verification failure.
- **Use**: Used to store and access metadata for transaction verification metrics.
