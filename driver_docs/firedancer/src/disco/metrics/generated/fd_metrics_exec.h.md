Defines constants and metadata for program cache metrics, including hits, misses, and invalidations.

# Purpose
This C header file defines a set of constants and metadata related to execution metrics for program cache operations. It includes definitions for various counters such as program cache misses, hits, fills, total size of fills, fill failures, duplicate insertions, and invalidations. Each metric is associated with an offset, a name, a type, a description, and a conversion type, which are used to track and describe specific events in the program cache. The file is automatically generated by a script (`gen_metrics.py`) and should not be manually edited. It also includes external references to other header files, `fd_metrics_base.h` and `fd_metrics_enums.h`, and declares an external array `FD_METRICS_EXEC` that holds metadata for these metrics.

### FD\_METRICS\_EXEC
- **Type**: ``fd_metrics_meta_t` array`
- **Description**: `FD_METRICS_EXEC` is an array of `fd_metrics_meta_t` structures. It contains metadata for execution-related metrics, such as program cache misses, hits, fills, and other related counters.
- **Use**: Used to store and provide access to metadata for various execution metrics.
