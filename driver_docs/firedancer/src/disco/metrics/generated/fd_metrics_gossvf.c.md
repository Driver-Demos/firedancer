Defines metrics for GOSSVF message and CRDS outcomes with counters for success and drop events.

# Purpose
The code defines a set of metrics related to the GOSSVF (Gossip Subsystem Verification Framework) in a networked system. It is a C source file that is generated automatically by a script named `gen_metrics.py`, and it should not be edited manually. The file includes the header `fd_metrics_gossvf.h` and defines an array `FD_METRICS_GOSSVF` of type `fd_metrics_meta_t`. This array contains various metrics that track the count and byte size of received messages (`GOSSVF_MESSAGE_RX_COUNT` and `GOSSVF_MESSAGE_RX_BYTES`) and CRDS (Contact Record Dissemination System) messages (`GOSSVF_CRDS_RX_COUNT` and `GOSSVF_CRDS_RX_BYTES`).

Each metric is declared using the macro `DECLARE_METRIC_ENUM`, which specifies the type of metric (e.g., `COUNTER`), the outcome of the message (e.g., `SUCCESS_PULL_REQUEST`, `DROPPED_UNPARSEABLE`), and the context (e.g., `GOSSVF_MESSAGE_OUTCOME`, `GOSSVF_CRDS_OUTCOME`). The metrics cover various outcomes such as successful message handling and different reasons for message drops, including signature issues, inactive states, and wallclock discrepancies. This file is part of a broader system for monitoring and analyzing the performance and reliability of the GOSSVF by providing detailed metrics on message handling.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `fd_metrics_gossvf.h`


# Global Variables

---
### FD\_METRICS\_GOSSVF
- **Type**: ``const fd_metrics_meta_t[]``
- **Description**: An array of `fd_metrics_meta_t` structures that defines various metrics related to message and CRDS (Contact Routing Data Structure) reception outcomes. Each element in the array is initialized using the `DECLARE_METRIC_ENUM` macro, which specifies the type of metric, its category, and the outcome it tracks.
- **Use**: Used to store and define metrics for tracking message and CRDS reception outcomes in a system.
