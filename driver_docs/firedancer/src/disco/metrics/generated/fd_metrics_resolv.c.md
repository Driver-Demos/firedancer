Defines metrics for resolution operations with various counters and enumerations.

# Purpose
The code defines a set of metrics for a system, which are used to track various events and states. These metrics are declared as constants in an array named `FD_METRICS_RESOLV`, which is of type `fd_metrics_meta_t`. The array is indexed by `FD_METRICS_RESOLV_TOTAL`, indicating the total number of metrics defined. Each metric is declared using macros such as `DECLARE_METRIC` and `DECLARE_METRIC_ENUM`, which likely expand to structures or functions that initialize the metrics with specific properties, such as type and category.

The metrics cover a range of operations and results, including counters for events like `RESOLV_NO_BANK_DROP`, and enumerated metrics for operations such as `RESOLV_STASH_OPERATION` and `RESOLV_LUT_RESOLVED`. These metrics are used to monitor specific outcomes, such as `INSERTED`, `OVERRUN`, and `SUCCESS`, among others. The file is generated by a script (`gen_metrics.py`), and it is not intended to be manually edited. This suggests that the metrics are part of a larger system where automated generation ensures consistency and accuracy in tracking system performance and behavior.

### FD\_METRICS\_RESOLV
- **Type**: ``const fd_metrics_meta_t[]``
- **Description**: An array of `fd_metrics_meta_t` structures that define various metrics related to resolution operations. Each element in the array represents a specific metric, such as `RESOLV_NO_BANK_DROP` or `RESOLV_LUT_RESOLVED`, and is associated with a counter to track occurrences of specific events or states.
- **Use**: Used to store and manage metrics for resolution operations, allowing for tracking and analysis of different resolution outcomes.
