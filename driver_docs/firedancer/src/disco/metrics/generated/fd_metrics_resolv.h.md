Defines metrics counters for transaction resolution events, including descriptions and types.

# Purpose
This C header file defines a set of metrics counters related to transaction resolution processes. It includes definitions for various metrics, such as the number of transactions dropped due to unavailable banks, operations on transaction stashes, resolved address lookup tables, expired blockhashes, and peer transaction failures. Each metric is associated with a unique offset, name, type, description, and converter type, which are used to track and describe specific events or conditions in the transaction resolution process. The file is automatically generated by a script (`gen_metrics.py`) and should not be manually edited. It also includes external references to other header files, `fd_metrics_base.h` and `fd_metrics_enums.h`, which likely provide foundational types and enumerations for these metrics.
# Imports and Dependencies

### FD\_METRICS\_RESOLV
- **Type**: ``fd_metrics_meta_t` array`
- **Description**: An array of `fd_metrics_meta_t` structures that contains metadata for various resolution metrics. Each element in the array represents a specific metric related to transaction resolution, such as counts of dropped transactions, stash operations, and resolved address lookup tables.
- **Use**: Used to store and access metadata for different resolution metrics in the system.
