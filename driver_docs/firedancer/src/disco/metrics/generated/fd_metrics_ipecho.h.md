Defines metrics for the ipecho service, including gauges and counters for connections and data transfer.

# Purpose
This C header file defines a set of metrics related to the `ipecho` service. It includes definitions for both gauge and counter metrics, which are used to monitor various aspects of the service's performance and usage. The file specifies offsets, names, types, descriptions, and conversion types for each metric. The metrics include `ipecho_shred_version`, `ipecho_connection_count`, `ipecho_connections_closed_ok`, `ipecho_connections_closed_error`, `ipecho_bytes_read`, and `ipecho_bytes_written`. These metrics help track the current shred version, the number of active connections, the number of connections closed normally or with errors, and the total bytes read and written. The file is auto-generated and should not be manually edited.

### FD\_METRICS\_IPECHO
- **Type**: ``fd_metrics_meta_t` array`
- **Description**: An array of `fd_metrics_meta_t` structures that contains metadata for various metrics related to the ipecho service. Each element in the array represents a specific metric, such as the number of active connections or the total bytes read and written.
