Defines metrics for monitoring the state and progress of snapshot loading in the Firedancer system.

# Purpose
This C header file defines a set of macros and an external array related to metrics for a "snapin" component. The file is automatically generated by a script named `gen_metrics.py` and should not be manually edited. It includes definitions for several gauge metrics, such as `FD_METRICS_GAUGE_SNAPIN_STATE`, `FD_METRICS_GAUGE_SNAPIN_FULL_BYTES_READ`, `FD_METRICS_GAUGE_SNAPIN_INCREMENTAL_BYTES_READ`, and `FD_METRICS_GAUGE_SNAPIN_ACCOUNTS_INSERTED`. Each metric is associated with an offset, name, type, description, and converter type. The file also declares an external constant array `FD_METRICS_SNAPIN`, which holds metadata for these metrics, and specifies the total number of metrics as `FD_METRICS_SNAPIN_TOTAL`.
# Imports and Dependencies

### FD\_METRICS\_SNAPIN
- **Type**: ``fd_metrics_meta_t` array`
- **Description**: An array of `fd_metrics_meta_t` structures that contains metadata for different snap-in metrics. Each element in the array represents a specific metric related to the snap-in process, such as state, bytes read, and accounts inserted.
- **Use**: Used to store and access metadata for snap-in metrics in the system.
