Defines metrics for replay operations using histograms and gauges in a generated C file.

# Purpose
This code is a C source file that defines an array of metric metadata structures, `FD_METRICS_REPLAY`, used for performance monitoring. The file is automatically generated by a script named `gen_metrics.py` and should not be manually edited. It includes the header file `fd_metrics_replay.h` and initializes the array with various metrics related to replay operations, such as `REPLAY_STORE_LINK_WAIT` and `REPLAY_TRANSACTIONS_TOTAL`. Each metric is declared using macros like `DECLARE_METRIC_HISTOGRAM_SECONDS` and `DECLARE_METRIC`, which specify the type of metric, such as `GAUGE` or `COUNTER`. The array size is determined by the constant `FD_METRICS_REPLAY_TOTAL`.
# Imports and Dependencies

- `fd_metrics_replay.h`


# Global Variables

### FD\_METRICS\_REPLAY
- **Type**: ``fd_metrics_meta_t` array`
- **Description**: An array of `fd_metrics_meta_t` structures that define various metrics related to replay operations. Each element in the array is initialized using macros that declare either histogram metrics in seconds or gauge and counter metrics.
- **Use**: Used to store and manage metrics for replay operations, including time spent in various states and counts of specific events.
