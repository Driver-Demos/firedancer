Defines constants and metadata for snapld state metrics in the Firedancer codebase.

# Purpose
This C header file defines constants and declarations related to metrics for a component named `snapld`. It includes other header files, `fd_metrics_base.h` and `fd_metrics_enums.h`, which likely provide foundational types and enumerations for metrics handling. The file defines a gauge metric `FD_METRICS_GAUGE_SNAPLD_STATE` with associated properties such as its name, type, description, and conversion method. The description specifies the possible states of a tile, including IDLE, PROCESSING, FINISHING, ERROR, and SHUTDOWN. Additionally, the file declares an external constant array `FD_METRICS_SNAPLD`, which is intended to hold metadata for the defined metrics. The file is auto-generated by a script named `gen_metrics.py`, and manual edits are not recommended.
