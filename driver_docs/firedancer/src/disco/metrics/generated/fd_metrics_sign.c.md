Defines a metrics histogram for sign duration in seconds.

# Purpose
This code is a C source file that defines a constant array `FD_METRICS_SIGN` of type `fd_metrics_meta_t`. The array is initialized with a metric histogram, `SIGN_SIGN_DURATION_SECONDS`, which is declared using the macro `DECLARE_METRIC_HISTOGRAM_SECONDS`. The file includes the header `fd_metrics_sign.h`, which likely contains necessary declarations and definitions related to metrics. The comment at the top indicates that this file is auto-generated by a script named `gen_metrics.py` and should not be manually edited.
