Defines metrics for repair operations, including counters and histograms, in a generated file.

# Purpose
This code is a C source file that defines an array of metrics for a repair system, which is part of a larger software application. The file includes the header `fd_metrics_repair.h` and defines a constant array `FD_METRICS_REPAIR` of type `fd_metrics_meta_t`. This array contains various metrics related to repair operations, such as packet counts, slot information, and latency measurements. Each metric is declared using macros like `DECLARE_METRIC`, `DECLARE_METRIC_ENUM`, and `DECLARE_METRIC_HISTOGRAM_SECONDS`, which specify the type and category of each metric. The file is automatically generated by a script named `gen_metrics.py`, and manual edits are not recommended.
# Imports and Dependencies

### FD\_METRICS\_REPAIR
- **Type**: ``const fd_metrics_meta_t[]``
- **Description**: An array of `fd_metrics_meta_t` structures that define various repair metrics. Each element in the array represents a specific metric related to repair operations, such as packet counts, slot completions, and response latencies.
- **Use**: Used to store and manage repair-related metrics for monitoring and analysis.
