Defines metrics counters and gauges for tracking various QUIC and UDP communication events.

# Purpose
The code is a C header file that defines a set of metrics for monitoring and analyzing network communication activities, specifically focusing on QUIC and UDP protocols. It includes a series of preprocessor directives that define constants for various metrics, such as counters and gauges, which track different aspects of network operations. These metrics include counts of packets sent and received, connection attempts, handshake completions, and errors encountered during communication. Each metric is associated with a unique offset, name, type, description, and conversion type, which are used to categorize and describe the metric's purpose and how it should be interpreted.

The file is generated by a script (`gen_metrics.py`) and is not intended to be manually edited. It includes references to other header files, such as `fd_metrics_base.h` and `fd_metrics_enums.h`, indicating that it is part of a larger system for metrics management. The metrics defined in this file are used to provide detailed insights into the performance and reliability of network communication, helping developers and system administrators to monitor and troubleshoot network-related issues. The file also declares an external array `FD_METRICS_SEND` that holds metadata for all defined metrics, which can be used by other parts of the system to access and utilize these metrics.

### FD\_METRICS\_SEND
- **Type**: ``fd_metrics_meta_t` array`
- **Description**: An array of `fd_metrics_meta_t` structures, `FD_METRICS_SEND` contains metadata for various metrics related to sending operations. Each element in the array represents a specific metric, such as counters for packets sent, connection attempts, and errors encountered during sending operations.
- **Use**: Used to store and access metadata for different sending metrics in the system.
