Defines a generated metrics store with a counter for inserted transactions.

# Purpose
This code is a C source file that defines a constant array `FD_METRICS_STORE` of type `fd_metrics_meta_t`. The array is initialized with metric declarations, specifically `DECLARE_METRIC(STORE_TRANSACTIONS_INSERTED, COUNTER)`, which suggests it is used to track metrics related to transactions. The file includes the header `fd_metrics_store.h`, which likely contains necessary type definitions and declarations for metrics handling. The comment at the top indicates that this file is auto-generated by a script named `gen_metrics.py`, and manual edits are not recommended.
