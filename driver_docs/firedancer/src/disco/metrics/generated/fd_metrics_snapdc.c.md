Defines metrics for SNAPDC using gauge types in a generated C file.

# Purpose
This code is a C source file that defines an array of metric metadata for a system, specifically related to "snapdc" metrics. The file includes the header `fd_metrics_snapdc.h` and declares a constant array `FD_METRICS_SNAPDC` of type `fd_metrics_meta_t`. This array contains metric definitions using the `DECLARE_METRIC` macro, each with a name and type, such as `SNAPDC_STATE` and `SNAPDC_FULL_COMPRESSED_BYTES_READ`, both of which are of type `GAUGE`. The file is automatically generated by a script named `gen_metrics.py`, and manual edits are not recommended.
# Imports and Dependencies

### FD\_METRICS\_SNAPDC
- **Type**: ``const fd_metrics_meta_t[]``
- **Description**: An array of `fd_metrics_meta_t` structures that holds metric metadata for SNAPDC operations. Each element in the array is initialized using the `DECLARE_METRIC` macro with a specific metric name and type, such as `SNAPDC_STATE` and `GAUGE`. The array size is determined by the `FD_METRICS_SNAPDC_TOTAL` constant.
- **Use**: Used to store and access metadata for various SNAPDC metrics in a structured format.
