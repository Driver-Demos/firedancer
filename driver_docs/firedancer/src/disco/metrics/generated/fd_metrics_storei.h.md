Defines constants and metadata for turbine slot metrics in the Firedancer codebase.

# Purpose
This C header file is automatically generated by a script named `gen_metrics.py` and should not be manually edited. It defines constants and metadata for metrics related to turbine slots, specifically for a system that uses gauges to measure these metrics. The file includes two main gauge metrics: `FD_METRICS_GAUGE_STOREI_FIRST_TURBINE_SLOT` and `FD_METRICS_GAUGE_STOREI_CURRENT_TURBINE_SLOT`, each with associated offset, name, type, description, and conversion type. The header also declares an external array `FD_METRICS_STOREI` of type `fd_metrics_meta_t`, which holds metadata for these metrics, and specifies the total number of metrics as `FD_METRICS_STOREI_TOTAL`. The file includes other headers, `fd_metrics_base.h` and `fd_metrics_enums.h`, which likely provide base definitions and enumerations used in this context.

### FD\_METRICS\_STOREI
- **Type**: ``fd_metrics_meta_t` array`
- **Description**: An array of `fd_metrics_meta_t` structures that contains metadata for metrics related to turbine slots. The array is defined with a size of `FD_METRICS_STOREI_TOTAL`, which is 2, indicating it holds metadata for two metrics.
- **Use**: Used to store metadata for metrics related to turbine slots in a constant array.
