Defines network metrics as counters and gauges for monitoring network performance.

# Purpose
This C source file defines an array of network metrics, `FD_METRICS_NET`, which is used to track various network-related statistics. The file is automatically generated and should not be manually edited. Each element in the array is defined using the `DECLARE_METRIC` macro, which specifies the metric's name and type, either `COUNTER` or `GAUGE`. The metrics include counts of received and transmitted packets, bytes, and various error conditions such as route failures and invalid descriptors. The file includes the header `fd_metrics_net.h`, which likely contains necessary declarations and definitions for the metrics system.

### FD\_METRICS\_NET
- **Type**: ``const fd_metrics_meta_t[]``
- **Description**: An array of `fd_metrics_meta_t` structures that define various network metrics. Each element in the array represents a specific network metric, such as packet counts, byte totals, and error counts, categorized as either a counter or a gauge.
- **Use**: Used to store and access network-related metrics for monitoring and analysis.
