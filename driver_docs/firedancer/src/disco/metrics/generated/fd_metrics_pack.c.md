Defines a set of metrics for microblock processing, including histograms, counters, and gauges.

# Purpose
The code defines a set of metrics for a system that processes transactions and microblocks. It is a C source file that is automatically generated by a script named `gen_metrics.py`, and it should not be manually edited. The file includes the header `fd_metrics_pack.h` and defines an array `FD_METRICS_PACK` of type `fd_metrics_meta_t`. This array contains various metrics declarations, which are used to track different aspects of the transaction processing system.

The metrics are categorized into histograms, counters, and gauges, and they cover a wide range of transaction states and events. For example, the code tracks the duration of different phases of microblock processing, the number of transactions per microblock, and various outcomes of transaction insertion attempts. It also includes metrics for transaction scheduling, bundle processing, and resource consumption. The use of macros like `DECLARE_METRIC_HISTOGRAM_SECONDS`, `DECLARE_METRIC`, and `DECLARE_METRIC_ENUM` suggests that these metrics are part of a larger framework for monitoring and analyzing the performance and behavior of the transaction processing system.

### FD\_METRICS\_PACK
- **Type**: ``const fd_metrics_meta_t[]``
- **Description**: An array of `fd_metrics_meta_t` structures that holds various metrics related to microblock processing and transaction handling. Each element in the array is initialized using macros like `DECLARE_METRIC_HISTOGRAM_SECONDS`, `DECLARE_METRIC`, and `DECLARE_METRIC_ENUM`, which define different types of metrics such as histograms and counters. The metrics cover a wide range of operations, including transaction insertion, scheduling, and microblock completion.
- **Use**: Used to store and manage metrics for performance monitoring and analysis of microblock and transaction processing.
