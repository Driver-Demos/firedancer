Defines an array of metrics for snapshot operations, including gauges and counters, in a generated file.

# Purpose
This C source file defines an array of metric metadata, `FD_METRICS_SNAPCT`, which is used to track various metrics related to snapshot operations. The file includes the header `fd_metrics_snapct.h` and contains a constant array of type `fd_metrics_meta_t`. Each element in the array is initialized using the `DECLARE_METRIC` macro, specifying the metric name and its type, such as `GAUGE` or `COUNTER`. The metrics include various states and counts related to full and incremental snapshot operations, such as retries, bytes read and written, and gossip counts. The file is automatically generated by a script named `gen_metrics.py` and should not be manually edited.

### FD\_METRICS\_SNAPCT
- **Type**: ``const fd_metrics_meta_t[]``
- **Description**: An array of `fd_metrics_meta_t` structures that holds metadata for various snapshot metrics. Each element in the array is initialized using the `DECLARE_METRIC` macro, which specifies the metric name and its type (either `GAUGE` or `COUNTER`).
- **Use**: Used to define and initialize a set of metrics related to snapshot operations, such as state, retries, bytes read/written, and gossip counts.
