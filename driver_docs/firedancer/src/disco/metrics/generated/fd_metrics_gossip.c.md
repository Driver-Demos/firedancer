Defines a set of gossip metrics for tracking various states and events in a network system.

# Purpose
The code defines a set of metrics related to a gossip protocol, which is a method used for information dissemination in distributed systems. The file is automatically generated and should not be manually edited. It includes an array of `fd_metrics_meta_t` structures named `FD_METRICS_GOSSIP`, which contains various metrics that are tracked as counters or gauges. These metrics are related to different aspects of the gossip protocol, such as ping tracking, CRDS (Conflict-free Replicated Data Structures) operations, and message transmission.

Each metric is declared using macros like `DECLARE_METRIC` and `DECLARE_METRIC_ENUM`, which specify the type of metric (e.g., `COUNTER` or `GAUGE`) and its associated categories or outcomes. The metrics cover a wide range of activities, including the capacity and count of ping trackers, the results of pong responses, changes in stake or address, and the transmission and reception of gossip messages. This file is intended to be included in other parts of the software to provide a structured way to monitor and analyze the performance and behavior of the gossip protocol.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `fd_metrics_gossip.h`


# Global Variables

---
### FD\_METRICS\_GOSSIP
- **Type**: ``const fd_metrics_meta_t[]``
- **Description**: An array of `fd_metrics_meta_t` structures that define various metrics related to the gossip protocol. Each element in the array represents a specific metric, which can be a counter or a gauge, and may include enumerated types for more detailed categorization.
- **Use**: Used to store and manage metrics for monitoring and analyzing the performance and behavior of the gossip protocol.
