Defines a set of metrics for monitoring send operations, including counters, gauges, and histograms.

# Purpose
The code defines a set of metrics for monitoring and analyzing the performance and behavior of a network communication system. It is a C source file that is automatically generated by a script named `gen_metrics.py`, and it should not be manually edited. The file includes a header file `fd_metrics_send.h` and declares an array `FD_METRICS_SEND` of type `fd_metrics_meta_t`. This array contains various metrics related to sending operations, such as counters and gauges for different events and states in the communication process.

The metrics cover a wide range of aspects, including connection states, packet handling, handshake processes, and frame transmission. They are categorized using macros like `DECLARE_METRIC`, `DECLARE_METRIC_ENUM`, and `DECLARE_METRIC_HISTOGRAM_SECONDS`, which define counters, enumerated metrics, and histograms, respectively. These metrics are used to track occurrences of specific events, such as successful or failed transmissions, connection errors, and packet size issues. The metrics are intended to provide detailed insights into the system's operation, helping to identify and diagnose issues in the network communication process.

### FD\_METRICS\_SEND
- **Type**: ``const fd_metrics_meta_t``
- **Description**: An array of `fd_metrics_meta_t` structures that define various metrics related to sending operations. Each element in the array represents a specific metric, which can be a counter, gauge, or histogram, and may include enumerated outcomes or states.
- **Use**: Used to track and record metrics for different sending operations and their outcomes in the system.
