Defines constants and metadata for various transaction and operation metrics in the Firedancer codebase.

# Purpose
This C header file defines a set of metrics counters related to transaction processing and resolution. It includes constants for each metric, such as offsets, names, types, descriptions, and conversion types. The metrics track various events, including transactions dropped due to unavailable banks, operations on transaction stashes, resolved address lookup tables, expired blockhashes, peer transaction failures, and database races. The file is auto-generated and should not be manually edited. It also declares an external array `FD_METRICS_RESOLF` that holds metadata for these metrics, with a total count defined by `FD_METRICS_RESOLF_TOTAL`.

### FD\_METRICS\_RESOLF
- **Type**: ``fd_metrics_meta_t` array`
- **Description**: An array of `fd_metrics_meta_t` structures, each representing metadata for different metrics related to transaction resolution failures. The array is defined with a size of `FD_METRICS_RESOLF_TOTAL`, which is 14.
- **Use**: Used to store metadata for various transaction resolution failure metrics, such as counts of specific failure types.
