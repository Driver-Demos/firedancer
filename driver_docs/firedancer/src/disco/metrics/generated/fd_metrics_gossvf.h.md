Defines constants and metadata for GOSSVF message and CRDS metrics in the Firedancer codebase.

# Purpose
The code is a C header file that defines a set of constants and metadata for tracking metrics related to message reception in a system. It is generated by a script named `gen_metrics.py` and should not be manually edited. The file includes other header files, `fd_metrics_base.h` and `fd_metrics_enums.h`, which likely provide base definitions and enumerations used in the metrics system.

The file defines several metrics counters and their associated properties, such as offsets, names, types, descriptions, and converters. These metrics are related to the reception of messages and bytes, including successful and dropped messages, across various categories like pull requests, push operations, and CRDS (Contact Record Dissemination System) messages. Each metric is associated with a unique offset and is categorized by the type of message or error condition it tracks. The file also declares an external array `FD_METRICS_GOSSVF`, which holds metadata for these metrics, and specifies the total number of metrics with `FD_METRICS_GOSSVF_TOTAL`. This header file is intended to be included in other C source files that need to access or manipulate these metrics.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `../fd_metrics_base.h`
- `fd_metrics_enums.h`


# Global Variables

---
### FD\_METRICS\_GOSSVF
- **Type**: ``fd_metrics_meta_t` array`
- **Description**: `FD_METRICS_GOSSVF` is an array of `fd_metrics_meta_t` structures. It is defined as a constant and external variable, indicating that it is used across multiple files. The array size is determined by the `FD_METRICS_GOSSVF_TOTAL` macro, which is set to 72.
- **Use**: Stores metadata for various GOSSVF metrics, including message and CRDS counts and bytes, for use in performance monitoring.
