Defines metrics counters for bank transaction processing, including failures and execution results.

# Purpose
This C header file defines a set of constants and metadata for tracking various metrics related to bank transactions. It includes definitions for different types of transaction outcomes, such as failures in sanitization, execution, and address table loading, as well as successful and failed executions. Each metric is associated with an offset, a name, a type, a description, and a converter type, which are used to categorize and describe the specific transaction events being monitored. The file is automatically generated by a script (`gen_metrics.py`) and should not be manually edited. It also includes an external declaration of an array `FD_METRICS_BANK`, which holds metadata for all defined metrics, and references other header files for base metrics and enumerations.
