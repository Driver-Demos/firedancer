Defines a set of QUIC-related metrics using counters, gauges, and histograms for performance monitoring.

# Purpose
The code defines a set of metrics related to QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections) protocol operations. It is a C source file that is automatically generated and should not be manually edited. The file includes an array of `fd_metrics_meta_t` structures named `FD_METRICS_QUIC`, which contains various metrics that are used to monitor and analyze the performance and behavior of QUIC connections. These metrics are declared using macros such as `DECLARE_METRIC`, `DECLARE_METRIC_ENUM`, and `DECLARE_METRIC_HISTOGRAM_SECONDS`, which categorize the metrics as counters, gauges, or histograms.

The metrics cover a wide range of QUIC-related activities, including transaction overrun, packet handling, connection states, handshake processes, and frame reception. Each metric is associated with a specific aspect of the QUIC protocol, such as the number of transactions received, packets sent and received, connection errors, and frame types processed. The use of enumerations allows for detailed categorization of certain metrics, such as connection states and packet handling types. This file is intended to be included in other parts of a larger system to provide detailed telemetry and monitoring capabilities for QUIC protocol operations.

### FD\_METRICS\_QUIC
- **Type**: ``const fd_metrics_meta_t``
- **Description**: An array of `fd_metrics_meta_t` structures that define various metrics related to QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections) operations. Each element in the array represents a specific metric, such as transaction overrun, packet reception, connection states, and more, using counters, gauges, and enumerations to track different aspects of QUIC performance and events.
- **Use**: Used to store and manage metrics for monitoring and analyzing QUIC protocol activities.
