Defines network link metrics as counters and gauges for monitoring purposes.

# Purpose
The code defines a set of network-related metrics using the `fd_metrics_meta_t` data structure. These metrics are part of a generated file, as indicated by the comment at the top, and should not be manually edited. The metrics are declared using macros such as `DECLARE_METRIC` and `DECLARE_METRIC_ENUM`, which likely expand to define specific properties of each metric, such as its type (e.g., `COUNTER` or `GAUGE`) and any associated enumeration values.

The metrics cover various aspects of network link operations, including event counts (`NETLNK_DROP_EVENTS`), synchronization events (`NETLNK_LINK_FULL_SYNCS`, `NETLNK_ROUTE_FULL_SYNCS`), and updates (`NETLNK_UPDATES`). Additionally, the code tracks interface and route counts (`NETLNK_INTERFACE_COUNT`, `NETLNK_ROUTE_COUNT`) and neighbor probe statistics (`NETLNK_NEIGH_PROBE_SENT`, `NETLNK_NEIGH_PROBE_FAILS`). The use of enumerations in some metrics suggests that these metrics can be further categorized, such as by message type or route table. This file is likely part of a larger system that monitors and reports on network performance and status.

### FD\_METRICS\_NETLNK
- **Type**: ``fd_metrics_meta_t` array`
- **Description**: An array of `fd_metrics_meta_t` structures that define various network link metrics. Each element in the array is initialized using macros like `DECLARE_METRIC` and `DECLARE_METRIC_ENUM`, which specify the type of metric (e.g., `COUNTER`, `GAUGE`) and its specific category or enumeration (e.g., `NETLINK_MSG`, `ROUTE_TABLE`).
- **Use**: Used to store and manage metadata for network link metrics in the application.
