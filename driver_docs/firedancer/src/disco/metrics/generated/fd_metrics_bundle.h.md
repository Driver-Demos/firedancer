Defines metrics counters, gauges, and histograms for tracking various bundle-related events and states.

# Purpose
The code is a C header file that defines a set of metrics for monitoring and tracking various performance and operational parameters related to a system that processes bundles, transactions, and network communications. The file is automatically generated by a script named `gen_metrics.py`, and it should not be manually edited. It includes definitions for counters, gauges, and histograms, which are used to measure different aspects of the system's performance, such as the number of transactions and packets received, errors encountered, heap size, and network-related metrics like round-trip time (RTT) and message receive delay.

Each metric is defined with a set of macros that specify its offset, name, type, description, and any conversion factors. The metrics cover a range of functionalities, including transaction and packet processing, error tracking, memory usage, connectivity status, and network performance. The file also declares an external array `FD_METRICS_BUNDLE` that holds metadata for all the defined metrics, which can be used by other parts of the system to access and utilize these metrics for monitoring and analysis purposes.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `../fd_metrics_base.h`
- `fd_metrics_enums.h`


# Global Variables

### FD\_METRICS\_BUNDLE
- **Type**: ``fd_metrics_meta_t` array`
- **Description**: An array of `fd_metrics_meta_t` structures that contains metadata for various metrics related to bundles. Each element in the array represents a specific metric, such as transaction counts, packet counts, error counts, and other performance indicators.
- **Use**: Used to store and access metadata for different metrics in the system.
