Defines metrics for BACKT_FINAL_SLOT and BACKT_START_SLOT as gauge types.

# Purpose
This C source code file defines an array of metric metadata, `FD_METRICS_BACKT`, which is used to store information about specific metrics. The file includes a header file, `fd_metrics_backt.h`, which likely contains necessary declarations and definitions related to these metrics. The array `FD_METRICS_BACKT` is initialized with two metrics, `BACKT_FINAL_SLOT` and `BACKT_START_SLOT`, both of which are declared as type `GAUGE` using the `DECLARE_METRIC` macro. The file is automatically generated by a script named `gen_metrics.py`, and manual edits are not recommended.
# Imports and Dependencies

### FD\_METRICS\_BACKT
- **Type**: ``const fd_metrics_meta_t[]``
- **Description**: An array of `fd_metrics_meta_t` structures that holds metric definitions for backtracking metrics. Each element in the array is initialized using the `DECLARE_METRIC` macro with specific metric identifiers and types.
- **Use**: Used to define and store metadata for backtracking metrics in a constant array.
