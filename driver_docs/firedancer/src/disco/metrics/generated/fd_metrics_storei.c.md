Defines a generated array of metric metadata for turbine slots using gauge metrics.

# Purpose
This code is a C source file that defines an array of metric metadata. The array `FD_METRICS_STOREI` is of type `fd_metrics_meta_t` and contains metric declarations using the `DECLARE_METRIC` macro. Each metric is associated with a name and a type, such as `STOREI_FIRST_TURBINE_SLOT` and `STOREI_CURRENT_TURBINE_SLOT`, both of which are of type `GAUGE`. The file includes the header `fd_metrics_storei.h`, which likely contains necessary type definitions and macro declarations. The comment at the top indicates that this file is auto-generated by a script named `gen_metrics.py` and should not be manually edited.
# Imports and Dependencies

### FD\_METRICS\_STOREI
- **Type**: ``const fd_metrics_meta_t[]``
- **Description**: An array of `fd_metrics_meta_t` structures that holds metric definitions for turbine slots. Each element in the array is initialized using the `DECLARE_METRIC` macro with a specific metric name and type.
- **Use**: Used to store and define metrics related to turbine slots in a constant array.
