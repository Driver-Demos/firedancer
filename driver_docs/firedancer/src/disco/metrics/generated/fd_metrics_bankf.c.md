Defines transaction result metrics as enumerated constants for the Firedancer codebase.

# Purpose
The code defines a set of metrics related to bank transactions, specifically for tracking various transaction results. It is part of a generated file, as indicated by the comment at the top, and should not be manually edited. The file includes the header `fd_metrics_bankf.h` and defines an array `FD_METRICS_BANKF` of type `fd_metrics_meta_t`. This array contains multiple entries created using the `DECLARE_METRIC_ENUM` macro, each representing a different transaction result metric.

Each metric in the array is categorized under `BANKF_TRANSACTION_RESULT` and is of type `COUNTER`, which suggests that these metrics are intended to count occurrences of specific transaction outcomes. The metrics cover a range of transaction results, such as `SUCCESS`, `INSTRUCTION_ERROR`, `ACCOUNT_NOT_FOUND`, and `INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS_FOR_FEE`, among others. This setup is likely used to monitor and analyze the performance and issues related to bank transactions by providing a structured way to count and categorize different transaction outcomes.

### FD\_METRICS\_BANKF
- **Type**: ``const fd_metrics_meta_t[]``
- **Description**: An array of `fd_metrics_meta_t` structures that define various transaction result metrics for the BANKF system. Each element in the array is initialized using the `DECLARE_METRIC_ENUM` macro, which specifies the type of transaction result and its associated counter metric.
- **Use**: Used to store and manage metrics related to transaction results in the BANKF system.
