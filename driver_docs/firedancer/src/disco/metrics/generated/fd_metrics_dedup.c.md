Defines metrics for deduplication processes with counters for transaction and gossip events.

# Purpose
This code is a C source file that defines an array of metric metadata for deduplication processes. The file includes the header `fd_metrics_dedup.h`, which likely contains necessary declarations and definitions related to the metrics. The array `FD_METRICS_DEDUP` is of type `fd_metrics_meta_t` and has a size defined by `FD_METRICS_DEDUP_TOTAL`. It initializes three metrics using the `DECLARE_METRIC` macro: `DEDUP_TRANSACTION_BUNDLE_PEER_FAILURE`, `DEDUP_TRANSACTION_DEDUP_FAILURE`, and `DEDUP_GOSSIPED_VOTES_RECEIVED`, each categorized as a `COUNTER`. The file is auto-generated by a script named `gen_metrics.py`, and manual edits are not recommended.
# Imports and Dependencies

### FD\_METRICS\_DEDUP
- **Type**: ``const fd_metrics_meta_t[]``
- **Description**: An array of `fd_metrics_meta_t` structures that holds metric declarations for deduplication processes. Each element in the array is initialized using the `DECLARE_METRIC` macro with a specific metric name and type, such as `COUNTER`. The array size is determined by the `FD_METRICS_DEDUP_TOTAL` constant.
- **Use**: Used to store and initialize deduplication-related metrics for monitoring purposes.
