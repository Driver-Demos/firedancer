Defines histogram metrics for measuring various delays in the Proof of History (PoH) process.

# Purpose
This C header file defines a set of metrics related to Proof of History (PoH) operations, specifically focusing on various delay times during slot leadership in a distributed system. The file includes definitions for histograms that measure delays such as the time between becoming a leader and receiving the bank, the first microblock, and completing the slot. Each metric is characterized by an offset, name, type, description, conversion factor, and minimum and maximum values. The file is automatically generated and should not be manually edited. It includes necessary dependencies from `fd_metrics_base.h` and `fd_metrics_enums.h`, and declares an external array `FD_METRICS_POH` to store metadata for these metrics.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `../fd_metrics_base.h`
- `fd_metrics_enums.h`


# Global Variables

---
### FD\_METRICS\_POH
- **Type**: ``fd_metrics_meta_t` array`
- **Description**: An array of `fd_metrics_meta_t` structures that contains metadata for various metrics related to Proof of History (PoH) delays. Each element in the array represents a specific metric, such as delays in leader slot initiation, microblock reception, slot completion, and bundle initialization.
- **Use**: Used to store and access metadata for PoH-related metrics in a structured format.
