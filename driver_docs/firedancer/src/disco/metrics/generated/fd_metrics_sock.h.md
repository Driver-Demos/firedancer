Defines socket-related metrics counters for tracking syscalls, packets, and bytes in the Firedancer codebase.

# Purpose
This C header file defines a set of constants and metadata for tracking socket-related metrics. It is automatically generated by a script named `gen_metrics.py` and should not be manually edited. The file includes definitions for various metrics counters, such as the number of `sendmmsg` and `recvmmsg` system calls, packets sent and received, and total bytes transmitted and received. Each metric is associated with an offset, a name, a type, a description, and a converter type, which are used to facilitate the collection and reporting of network socket performance data. The file also declares an external array `FD_METRICS_SOCK` that holds metadata for these metrics.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `../fd_metrics_base.h`
- `fd_metrics_enums.h`


# Global Variables

### FD\_METRICS\_SOCK
- **Type**: ``fd_metrics_meta_t` array`
- **Description**: An array of `fd_metrics_meta_t` structures that contains metadata for socket-related metrics. Each element in the array represents a specific metric, such as the number of packets sent or received, and includes details like the metric's name, type, description, and conversion method.
- **Use**: Used to store and access metadata for various socket-related metrics in the application.
