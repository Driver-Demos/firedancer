Defines constants and metadata for snapshot metrics, including gauges and counters for tracking snapshot states and retries.

# Purpose
The code is a C header file that defines a set of metrics related to snapshot operations, specifically for monitoring the state and performance of full and incremental snapshot downloads. It includes definitions for various metrics such as gauges and counters, which track different aspects of the snapshot process. These metrics include the state of the tile, the number of retries for full and incremental snapshot downloads, the number of bytes read and written, and the total size of the snapshot files. Additionally, it tracks the number of gossip peers encountered during the process.

Each metric is defined with a unique offset, name, type, description, and converter type. The file includes references to other header files, `fd_metrics_base.h` and `fd_metrics_enums.h`, which likely provide base definitions and enumerations used in the metrics. The file is generated by a script (`gen_metrics.py`), indicating that it is part of an automated system for managing metrics. The `FD_METRICS_SNAPCT` array, declared as an external constant, holds metadata for these metrics, and its size is defined by `FD_METRICS_SNAPCT_TOTAL`. This header file is intended to be included in other C source files that need to access or manipulate these snapshot metrics.

### FD\_METRICS\_SNAPCT
- **Type**: ``fd_metrics_meta_t` array`
- **Description**: `FD_METRICS_SNAPCT` is an array of `fd_metrics_meta_t` structures. It contains metadata for various metrics related to snapshot operations, such as state, retries, bytes read and written, and gossip peer counts.
- **Use**: Used to store and access metadata for snapshot-related metrics.
