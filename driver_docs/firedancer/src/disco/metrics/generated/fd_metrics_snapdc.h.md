Defines gauge metrics for monitoring the state and byte counts of snapshot files in the SnapDC system.

# Purpose
This C header file defines a set of metrics related to the state and data processing of a system component referred to as "snapdc." The file is automatically generated and should not be manually edited. It includes definitions for several gauge metrics, each with an associated offset, name, type, description, and conversion type. These metrics track various states and data read operations, such as the state of a tile and the number of bytes read from compressed and decompressed snapshot files. The file also declares an external array `FD_METRICS_SNAPDC` that holds metadata for these metrics, with a total count defined by `FD_METRICS_SNAPDC_TOTAL`. The header includes other necessary headers, `fd_metrics_base.h` and `fd_metrics_enums.h`, to support these definitions.

### FD\_METRICS\_SNAPDC
- **Type**: ``fd_metrics_meta_t[]``
- **Description**: An array of `fd_metrics_meta_t` structures that contains metadata for various metrics related to the snapshot decompression process. Each element in the array corresponds to a specific metric, such as the state of the tile or the number of bytes read from snapshot files.
- **Use**: Used to store and provide access to metadata for snapshot decompression metrics.
