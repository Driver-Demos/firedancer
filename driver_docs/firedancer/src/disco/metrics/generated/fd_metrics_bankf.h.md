Defines constants and metadata for tracking transaction result metrics in the Firedancer codebase.

# Purpose
This C header file defines a set of constants and an external array related to transaction result metrics for a system. It includes definitions for various transaction result types, such as success, instruction error, and account-related errors, each associated with a unique offset value. The file is automatically generated by a script (`gen_metrics.py`) and should not be manually edited. It includes necessary headers, `fd_metrics_base.h` and `fd_metrics_enums.h`, to provide foundational types and enumerations. The file declares an external array `FD_METRICS_BANKF` of type `fd_metrics_meta_t`, which holds metadata for these transaction result metrics, and specifies the total number of metrics as `FD_METRICS_BANKF_TOTAL`.
# Imports and Dependencies

### FD\_METRICS\_BANKF
- **Type**: ``fd_metrics_meta_t[]``
- **Description**: An array of `fd_metrics_meta_t` structures that contains metadata for various transaction result metrics in the BankF system. Each element in the array corresponds to a specific transaction result metric, such as success, instruction error, or insufficient funds for fee.
- **Use**: Used to store and access metadata for transaction result metrics in the BankF system.
