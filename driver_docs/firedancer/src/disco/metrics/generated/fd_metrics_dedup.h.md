Defines metrics counters for deduplication failures and gossiped votes in the Firedancer codebase.

# Purpose
This C header file defines a set of metrics related to transaction deduplication processes. It includes constants for three specific metrics: `FD_METRICS_COUNTER_DEDUP_TRANSACTION_BUNDLE_PEER_FAILURE`, `FD_METRICS_COUNTER_DEDUP_TRANSACTION_DEDUP_FAILURE`, and `FD_METRICS_COUNTER_DEDUP_GOSSIPED_VOTES_RECEIVED`. Each metric is associated with an offset, a name, a type, a description, and a converter type, which are used to track and describe various deduplication failures and events. The file is automatically generated by a script (`gen_metrics.py`) and should not be manually edited. It also includes references to other header files, `fd_metrics_base.h` and `fd_metrics_enums.h`, which likely provide base definitions and enumerations for the metrics system.
# Imports and Dependencies

### FD\_METRICS\_DEDUP
- **Type**: ``fd_metrics_meta_t` array`
- **Description**: An array of `fd_metrics_meta_t` structures that contains metadata for deduplication metrics. The array is defined with a size of `FD_METRICS_DEDUP_TOTAL`, which is 3.
- **Use**: Used to store metadata for deduplication-related metrics in the system.
