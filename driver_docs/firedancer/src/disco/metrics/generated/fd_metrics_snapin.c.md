Defines an array of metrics for the snap-in component, generated by a Python script.

# Purpose
This code is a C source file that defines an array of metric metadata for a software component, specifically a "snap-in" module. The file includes the header `fd_metrics_snapin.h` and declares a constant array `FD_METRICS_SNAPIN` of type `fd_metrics_meta_t`. This array contains metric definitions using the `DECLARE_METRIC` macro, which specifies the metric name and type, such as `SNAPIN_STATE` and `SNAPIN_FULL_BYTES_READ`, both of which are of type `GAUGE`. The file is auto-generated by a script named `gen_metrics.py`, and manual edits are not recommended.
# Imports and Dependencies

### FD\_METRICS\_SNAPIN
- **Type**: ``const fd_metrics_meta_t[]``
- **Description**: An array of `fd_metrics_meta_t` structures that holds metric definitions for a snap-in component. Each element in the array is initialized using the `DECLARE_METRIC` macro with a specific metric name and type, such as `SNAPIN_STATE` and `GAUGE`. The array size is determined by the `FD_METRICS_SNAPIN_TOTAL` constant.
- **Use**: Used to define and store metrics related to the snap-in component for monitoring purposes.
