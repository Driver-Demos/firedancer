Defines metrics for netlink events, including counters and gauges for network interfaces and routes.

# Purpose
This C header file defines a set of constants and macros related to network link metrics. It is automatically generated by a script named `gen_metrics.py` and should not be manually edited. The file includes definitions for various metrics counters and gauges, such as `FD_METRICS_COUNTER_NETLNK_DROP_EVENTS` and `FD_METRICS_GAUGE_NETLNK_INTERFACE_COUNT`, which track network-related events like drop events, full syncs, and interface counts. Each metric is associated with an offset, name, type, description, and conversion type, which are used to monitor and report network performance and status. The file also declares an external array `FD_METRICS_NETLNK` that holds metadata for these metrics.
# Imports and Dependencies

### FD\_METRICS\_NETLNK
- **Type**: ``fd_metrics_meta_t` array`
- **Description**: An array of `fd_metrics_meta_t` structures that contains metadata for various network link metrics. Each element in the array represents a specific metric related to network link operations, such as drop events, full syncs, updates, interface counts, and neighbor probe statistics.
- **Use**: Used to store and access metadata for network link metrics in the application.
