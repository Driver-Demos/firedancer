Defines a set of metrics for monitoring bundle transactions, errors, and performance in Firedancer.

# Purpose
This C source code file defines an array of metrics metadata, `FD_METRICS_BUNDLE`, which is used for monitoring and tracking various performance and error metrics in a system. The file includes the header `fd_metrics_bundle.h` and initializes the array with a series of metrics using macros such as `DECLARE_METRIC`, `DECLARE_METRIC_ENUM`, and `DECLARE_METRIC_HISTOGRAM_NONE`. These macros define different types of metrics, including counters and gauges, for events like transactions received, packets received, and various error types. The file is automatically generated by a script (`gen_metrics.py`) and should not be manually edited.

### FD\_METRICS\_BUNDLE
- **Type**: ``fd_metrics_meta_t` array`
- **Description**: An array of `fd_metrics_meta_t` structures that defines various metrics related to bundle operations. Each element in the array represents a specific metric, such as transaction counts, error types, heap sizes, and round-trip times, using different metric types like `COUNTER`, `GAUGE`, and `HISTOGRAM`. The array is initialized with predefined metrics using macros like `DECLARE_METRIC`, `DECLARE_METRIC_ENUM`, and `DECLARE_METRIC_HISTOGRAM_NONE`. The total number of metrics is determined by `FD_METRICS_BUNDLE_TOTAL`. 
- **Use**: Used to store and manage metrics for monitoring and analyzing bundle operations.
