Defines socket-related metrics as enumerations and counters for system call tracking.

# Purpose
This C source file defines an array of `fd_metrics_meta_t` structures named `FD_METRICS_SOCK`, which is used to store metadata for various socket-related metrics. The file is automatically generated by a script named `gen_metrics.py` and should not be manually edited. The metrics include counters for different socket system call errors and packet counts, such as `SOCK_SYSCALLS_SENDMMSG` with various error types, and general metrics like `SOCK_RX_PKT_CNT` and `SOCK_TX_BYTES_TOTAL`. The file includes the header `fd_metrics_sock.h`, which likely contains necessary declarations and definitions for the metrics and related functions.

### FD\_METRICS\_SOCK
- **Type**: ``fd_metrics_meta_t` array`
- **Description**: An array of `fd_metrics_meta_t` structures that define various socket-related metrics. Each element in the array is initialized using the `DECLARE_METRIC_ENUM` or `DECLARE_METRIC` macros, which specify the type of metric and its associated error or counter type.
- **Use**: Used to store and manage metrics related to socket system calls and data transmission.
