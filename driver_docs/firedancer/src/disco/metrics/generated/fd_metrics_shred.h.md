Defines metrics for monitoring shred operations, including histograms and counters for various shred-related events.

# Purpose
The code is a C header file that defines a set of metrics related to the "shred" process in a system. It is generated by a script named `gen_metrics.py` and should not be manually edited. The file includes definitions for various metrics, which are categorized as either histograms or counters. Each metric is associated with a name, type, description, and other attributes such as offset, conversion type, and range (for histograms). These metrics are used to monitor and record different aspects of the shred process, such as the number of microblocks abandoned, the size of microblock batches, the duration of shredding operations, and the number of shreds processed or rejected.

The file includes references to other header files, `fd_metrics_base.h` and `fd_metrics_enums.h`, which likely provide base definitions and enumerations used in the metrics. The metrics are defined using preprocessor macros, which assign specific offsets and names to each metric, facilitating their use in the system. The file also declares an external array `FD_METRICS_SHRED`, which holds metadata for all defined metrics, and specifies the total number of metrics with `FD_METRICS_SHRED_TOTAL`. This header file is intended to be included in other C source files that require access to these shred-related metrics for monitoring or logging purposes.

### FD\_METRICS\_SHRED
- **Type**: ``fd_metrics_meta_t` array`
- **Description**: `FD_METRICS_SHRED` is an array of `fd_metrics_meta_t` structures, which are used to store metadata for various metrics related to the shredding process. The array contains a total of 24 elements, each representing a specific metric such as counters and histograms for different shredding operations.
- **Use**: Used to define and access metadata for shredding-related metrics in the system.
