Defines various enumerations for metrics in the Firedancer codebase, generated by `gen_metrics.py`.

# Purpose
The code is a C header file that defines a series of enumerations for various metrics used in a software system. These enumerations are represented as preprocessor macros, which include names and indices for different metric categories. Each category has a defined count of possible values, and each value is associated with a specific index and name. The file is generated automatically by a script (`gen_metrics.py`), and it is not intended to be edited manually.

The enumerations cover a wide range of metrics, including network errors, transaction results, and various states related to QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections) protocol operations. Each metric category is defined with a name, a count of possible values, and individual value definitions that include an index and a descriptive name. This structure allows for consistent and efficient tracking and reporting of metrics within the system. The header file is intended to be included in other C source files where these metrics are needed, providing a standardized way to reference and use these enumerations across the codebase.
