Makefile rules to add header and object files for the `fd_disco` component.

# Purpose
The `Makefile` content uses the `add-hdrs` and `add-objs` functions to manage header and object files in a build process. The first line adds header files with the `.h` extension from the directory specified by `MKPATH`. The second line adds object files by transforming source files with the `.c` extension into object files, excluding the extension, and associates them with the `fd_disco` target.
