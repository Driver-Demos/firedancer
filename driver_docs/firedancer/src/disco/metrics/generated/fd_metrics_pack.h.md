Defines metrics for tracking transaction processing and microblock scheduling in the Firedancer system.

# Purpose
The file `fd_metrics_pack.h` is a C header file that defines a set of metrics for monitoring and analyzing the performance of a transaction processing system. This file is automatically generated by a script (`gen_metrics.py`) and should not be manually edited. It includes definitions for various metrics related to the scheduling, insertion, and processing of transactions within a system referred to as "pack." The metrics are categorized into histograms, counters, and gauges, each serving a specific purpose in tracking different aspects of transaction handling.

The metrics defined in this file include histograms for measuring the duration of various operations, such as scheduling microblocks and inserting transactions, as well as counters for tracking the number of transactions received, inserted, or dropped. Gauges are used to monitor the number of available transactions and the size of the transaction pool. Each metric is associated with a unique offset, name, type, description, and conversion factor, which are used to facilitate the collection and interpretation of performance data. The file also declares an external array `FD_METRICS_PACK` that holds metadata for all defined metrics, allowing other parts of the system to access and utilize this information for performance monitoring and analysis.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `../fd_metrics_base.h`
- `fd_metrics_enums.h`

### FD\_METRICS\_PACK
- **Type**: ``fd_metrics_meta_t[]``
- **Description**: An array of `fd_metrics_meta_t` structures, each representing metadata for a specific metric in the Firedancer system. The array is indexed by metric identifiers and contains information such as metric type, description, and conversion details.
- **Use**: Used to store and access metadata for various metrics in the Firedancer system.
