Makefile for adding headers and objects related to Prometheus and metrics if FD_HAS_ALLOCA is defined.

# Purpose
The `Makefile` configuration uses conditional directives to manage the inclusion of headers and object files based on the presence of the `FD_HAS_ALLOCA` macro. If `FD_HAS_ALLOCA` is defined, it adds the headers `fd_prometheus.h` and `fd_metrics.h` and the object files `fd_prometheus`, `fd_metrics`, and `fd_metric_tile` to the build process, associating them with the `fd_disco` target. This setup allows for conditional compilation and linking of specific components depending on the system's capabilities.
