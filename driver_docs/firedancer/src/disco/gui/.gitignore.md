Specifies files and directories to ignore in version control for the GUI component.

# Purpose
The file lists directories that likely represent different distribution channels or stages for software components. The directories `dist_stable_cmp`, `dist_alpha_cmp`, and `dist_dev_cmp` suggest stable, alpha, and development versions, respectively. This structure can help organize and manage different versions of software components during the development and release process.
