Defines static file arrays for different environments with binary data and compressed versions.

# Purpose
The code is a C source file that is automatically generated and should not be edited manually. It includes the header file `http_import_dist.h` and uses the macro `FD_IMPORT_BINARY` to import various binary assets into the program. These assets include SVG images, JavaScript files, CSS files, font files, and HTML files. Each asset is imported in three formats: the original, a Zstandard-compressed version, and a gzip-compressed version. The assets are organized into three categories: stable, alpha, and dev, which likely correspond to different stages or versions of the software.

The file defines three arrays of type `fd_http_static_file_t`: `STATIC_FILES_STABLE`, `STATIC_FILES_ALPHA`, and `STATIC_FILES_DEV`. Each array contains entries that map asset names to their corresponding data and compressed versions. Each entry includes pointers to the data, the data length, and the compressed data and their lengths. The arrays are terminated with a zeroed entry. This setup is used to manage static files for an HTTP server, allowing the server to serve these files in different formats based on client requests.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `http_import_dist.h`


# Global Variables

---
### STATIC\_FILES\_STABLE
- **Type**: ``fd_http_static_file_t[]``
- **Description**: Contains an array of static file metadata for HTTP serving. Each element in the array represents a file with its name, raw data, and compressed data in Zstandard and Gzip formats.
- **Use**: Used to serve static files in an HTTP server environment.


---
### STATIC\_FILES\_ALPHA
- **Type**: ``fd_http_static_file_t[]``
- **Description**: Contains an array of `fd_http_static_file_t` structures, each representing a static file with its name, raw data, and compressed data in Zstandard and Gzip formats. Each entry includes pointers to the data and its length for both compressed and uncompressed versions.
- **Use**: Used to store and manage static files for HTTP serving, providing access to both compressed and uncompressed data.


---
### STATIC\_FILES\_DEV
- **Type**: ``fd_http_static_file_t[]``
- **Description**: Contains an array of static file metadata for development assets. Each element in the array represents a file with its name, raw data, and compressed data in Zstandard and Gzip formats.
- **Use**: Used to store and access metadata for static files in a development environment.
