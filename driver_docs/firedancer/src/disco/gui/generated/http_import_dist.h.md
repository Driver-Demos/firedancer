Defines a structure and arrays for handling static HTTP files with compression data.

# Purpose
This C header file defines a structure and declares external arrays for managing static HTTP files. The `fd_http_static_file` structure contains metadata for a static file, including its name, raw data, and compressed data in Zstandard and Gzip formats, along with their respective lengths. The typedef `fd_http_static_file_t` provides an alias for the structure. The file declares three external arrays: `STATIC_FILES_STABLE`, `STATIC_FILES_ALPHA`, and `STATIC_FILES_DEV`, which are null-terminated and store collections of `fd_http_static_file_t` structures. These arrays categorize static files into different environments or stages, such as stable, alpha, and development.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `../../../util/fd_util.h`


# Global Variables

---
### STATIC\_FILES\_STABLE
- **Type**: ``fd_http_static_file_t[]``
- **Description**: An array of `fd_http_static_file_t` structures that is null-terminated. Each element in the array represents a static file with its name, data, and compressed data in different formats (Zstandard and Gzip).
- **Use**: Used to store and manage stable static files for HTTP operations.


---
### STATIC\_FILES\_ALPHA
- **Type**: ``fd_http_static_file_t[]``
- **Description**: An array of `fd_http_static_file_t` structures that is null-terminated. Each element in the array represents a static file with its name, data, and compressed data in different formats (Zstandard and Gzip).
- **Use**: Used to store and manage static files for the alpha version of the software.


---
### STATIC\_FILES\_DEV
- **Type**: ``fd_http_static_file_t[]``
- **Description**: An array of `fd_http_static_file_t` structures, where each structure represents a static file with its name, data, and compressed data in different formats (Zstandard and Gzip). The array is null-terminated, indicating the end of the list of static files.
- **Use**: Used to store and manage static files for the development environment, allowing access to their data and compressed forms.


# Data Structures

---
### fd\_http\_static\_file
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `name`: Pointer to a constant character string that represents the name of the static file.
    - `data`: Pointer to constant unsigned character data of the static file.
    - `data_len`: Pointer to a constant unsigned long integer that represents the length of the `data`.
    - `zstd_data`: Pointer to constant unsigned character data that represents the Zstandard compressed version of the static file.
    - `zstd_data_len`: Pointer to a constant unsigned long integer that represents the length of the `zstd_data`.
    - `gzip_data`: Pointer to constant unsigned character data that represents the Gzip compressed version of the static file.
    - `gzip_data_len`: Pointer to a constant unsigned long integer that represents the length of the `gzip_data`.
- **Description**: Represents a static file with its name, raw data, and compressed data in both Zstandard and Gzip formats, along with their respective lengths.
