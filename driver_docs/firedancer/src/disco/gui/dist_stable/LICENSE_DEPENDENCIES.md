A list of software dependencies with their licenses, versions, and descriptions.

# Purpose
This file contains metadata for various software packages used in a codebase. Each entry provides details about a specific package, including its name, version, license type, and whether it is private. The metadata also includes a description of the package's functionality, the repository URL, and the homepage for further information. The file serves as a comprehensive list of dependencies, which is crucial for managing software versions, ensuring license compliance, and facilitating updates. The consistent use of the MIT License across most packages indicates a permissive licensing model, allowing for wide usage and modification. This metadata is essential for developers to understand the components integrated into their projects and to maintain the software effectively.
# Content Summary
The provided content is a list of metadata for various software packages, primarily JavaScript libraries and tools. Each entry includes details such as the package name, version, license type, privacy status, description, repository URL, homepage, author, and license information. The packages are used for a variety of purposes, including building user interfaces, managing state, handling animations, and more.

Key details for developers include:

1. **React and Related Packages**: 
   - `react` and `react-dom` are core libraries for building user interfaces in JavaScript. They are both licensed under the MIT License and are publicly accessible.
   - `scheduler` is a cooperative scheduler for the browser environment, also under the MIT License.

2. **Radix UI Packages**: 
   - A series of packages prefixed with `@radix-ui` provide components and utilities for building user interfaces. These include components for dialogs, menus, popovers, and more. All are licensed under the MIT License.

3. **Floating UI Packages**: 
   - Packages like `@floating-ui/core` and `@floating-ui/react-dom` offer utilities for positioning floating elements such as tooltips and dropdowns. They are licensed under the MIT License.

4. **TanStack Packages**: 
   - Packages such as `@tanstack/store` and `@tanstack/react-router` provide tools for state management and routing in React applications. They are licensed under the MIT License.

5. **D3 Packages**: 
   - D3 packages like `d3-color`, `d3-array`, and `d3-scale` provide utilities for data visualization, including color manipulation and data scaling. They are licensed under the ISC License.

6. **AG Grid Packages**: 
   - Packages like `@ag-grid-community/core` and `@ag-grid-community/react` provide advanced data grid components for various frameworks. They are licensed under the MIT License.

7. **Miscellaneous Packages**: 
   - Other packages include `lodash` for utility functions, `immer` for immutable state management, and `react-use` for React hooks. Most of these are licensed under the MIT License, with some exceptions like `react-use` which is under the Unlicense.

The consistent use of the MIT License across most packages indicates a permissive licensing model, allowing for wide usage and modification. Developers should note the repository URLs and homepages for accessing source code and documentation.
