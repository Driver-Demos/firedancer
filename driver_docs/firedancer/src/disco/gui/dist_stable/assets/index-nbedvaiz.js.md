Integrates with AG Grid to manage data grids, including drag-and-drop, filtering, pagination, and event handling.

# Purpose
The code is a JavaScript module that integrates with the AG Grid library to provide a comprehensive grid system for managing and displaying data. It includes functionalities for drag-and-drop interactions, filter and column management, row rendering, pagination, and event handling. The module manages drag sources and drop targets within the grid, creating visual representations of drag operations and supporting external drop zones. It also handles various types of filters, floating filters, and quick filters, allowing users to apply and manage filters across grid columns. Column management features include visibility, movement, pinning, and hierarchical structures, while row management covers rendering, selection, and expansion. The module supports pagination for efficient data handling and includes an event service for managing grid-related events. Additionally, it provides a React component for rendering a grid with validator data, using AG Grid's features like sorting, filtering, and custom styling. The module is designed to be part of a larger framework, offering a set of tools for building interactive and configurable grid-based applications.
