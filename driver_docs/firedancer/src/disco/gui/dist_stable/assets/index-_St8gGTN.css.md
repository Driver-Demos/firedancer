Defines styles for AG Grid components using CSS variables for themes, layout, and responsive design.

# Purpose
The CSS stylesheet defines the styles for a grid component, focusing on the `ag-theme-quartz`, `ag-theme-quartz-dark`, and `ag-theme-quartz-auto-dark` themes. It includes CSS classes and variables that manage the appearance and behavior of UI elements such as icons, buttons, headers, panels, filter tool panels, and input fields. The stylesheet uses CSS variables like `--ag-grid-size`, `--ag-control-panel-background-color`, and `--ag-active-color` to facilitate easy customization and consistent theming. Media queries are included to adjust styles based on user system preferences, such as dark mode. This stylesheet is essential for ensuring the grid component renders correctly and consistently across different environments and themes, providing a uniform user interface.
# Content Summary
The CSS stylesheet is designed for a grid component within a web application, specifically tailored for the "ag-theme-quartz" theme and its variations, including "ag-theme-quartz-dark" and "ag-theme-quartz-auto-dark". This stylesheet is integral to styling components of the AG Grid, a data grid component used in JavaScript frameworks.

The stylesheet defines styles for various elements and components within the grid, such as icons, headers, cells, tool panels, and menus. It uses CSS variables extensively to manage colors, sizes, and other style properties, facilitating easy customization and theming. Key technical aspects include:

1. **Icon Styles**: The stylesheet specifies styles for different icons used in the grid, including aggregation, arrows, and sorting icons. CSS variables control font family, weight, color, size, and image properties, ensuring consistent iconography.

2. **Color and Theme Management**: CSS variables define colors for different themes, supporting light and dark modes. Variables like `--ag-background-color`, `--ag-foreground-color`, and `--ag-active-color` manage the color scheme, allowing for seamless theme transitions.

3. **Layout and Sizing**: The stylesheet outlines layout properties for grid components, such as row height, header height, and padding. Variables like `--ag-row-height` and `--ag-header-height` ensure uniform sizing across the grid.

4. **Responsive Design**: Media queries are included to adjust styles based on screen resolution and user preferences, such as dark mode, enhancing the grid's adaptability to various devices.

5. **Component Styles**: Styles are defined for grid components, including headers, cells, tool panels, and menus. These styles manage component appearance and behavior, incorporating hover effects, focus states, and transitions.

6. **Accessibility and User Interaction**: The stylesheet enhances accessibility and user interaction through styles for focus states and hover effects. Properties like `outline`, `box-shadow`, and `transition` provide visual feedback.

7. **Padding and Margins**: CSS variables like `--ag-grid-size` and `--ag-icon-size` calculate padding and margins, ensuring consistent spacing across components such as filter tool panels, headers, and input fields.

8. **Background and Border Styles**: Background colors are set using variables like `--ag-control-panel-background-color`, with borders often set to none for a minimalist design.

9. **Opacity and Cursor Styles**: Opacity indicates disabled states for icons and buttons, with specific values like 0.6 and 0.35. The cursor style is set to `pointer` for interactive elements and `not-allowed` for disabled elements.

10. **RTL and LTR Support**: The stylesheet includes styles for both left-to-right (LTR) and right-to-left (RTL) text directions, adjusting padding and margin to support different languages and layouts.

11. **SVG Icons**: SVG data URLs are used for icons, ensuring scalability and clarity across different screen resolutions.

This stylesheet is crucial for developers using AG Grid, providing a structured approach to styling that leverages CSS variables for flexibility and maintainability, ensuring consistent and accessible user interfaces across the "quartz" theme and its variations.
