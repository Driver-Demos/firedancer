# Content Summary
The CSS file is a configuration document that defines a comprehensive set of styles and variables for a web application's theme system. It manages the visual presentation, layout, and responsiveness of the application across different devices and screen sizes. The file uses CSS custom properties (variables) to allow for flexible theming and styling across various components.

Key technical details include:

1. **Font Definitions and Typography**: The file includes `@font-face` rules to define custom fonts such as "Inter Tight" and "Roboto Mono," specifying styles, weights, and source URLs. It also defines typography-related variables, including font sizes, weights, line heights, and letter spacing for different text elements like headings, code, strong, and emphasized text.

2. **Color Variables and Theming**: The file defines a wide range of color variables for different themes and color schemes, including base colors and their variations (e.g., `--gray-1` to `--gray-12`). It supports both light and dark themes, using media queries and feature queries to adjust colors based on the user's display capabilities. Accent colors can be dynamically set using data attributes.

3. **Responsive Design and Layout**: The stylesheet uses media queries to apply different styles based on screen width, ensuring the application is responsive. It defines breakpoints for various screen sizes and includes variables for spacing and container widths to ensure consistent layout and responsive design.

4. **Component Styles and State Management**: Styles are defined for various UI components such as buttons, cards, checkboxes, and menus. Each component has size variants and state-based styles (e.g., hover, active, disabled). The file uses pseudo-classes to manage component states, ensuring visual feedback on user interactions.

5. **Animations and Transitions**: Keyframe animations are defined for transitions such as fade-in, fade-out, and sliding effects, enhancing the user experience with smooth visual transitions.

6. **Accessibility and Interaction**: The file includes cursor styles for interactive elements and outlines for focus states to enhance accessibility. It uses properties like `user-select` to control text selection behavior.

7. **Grid and Flexbox Layouts**: The stylesheet defines classes for grid and flexbox layouts, allowing elements to be placed and aligned within their containers. This includes positioning elements and aligning content using flexbox and grid properties.

8. **Shadow and Effects**: Shadow definitions are included for various UI components to provide depth and visual hierarchy.

Overall, this CSS file is essential for maintaining a consistent and adaptable design system across a web application, allowing developers to easily manage and update the visual appearance of the application.
