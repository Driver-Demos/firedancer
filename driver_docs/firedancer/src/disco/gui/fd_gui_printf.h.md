Functions to format GUI state as JSON messages for WebSocket communication.

# Purpose
This C header file defines a collection of function prototypes for formatting and sending various types of data related to a graphical user interface (GUI) as JSON messages. These functions are designed to format the current state of the GUI and related data structures into JSON messages that can be sent to WebSocket clients. The functions cover a wide range of data points, including version information, cluster status, identity keys, vote states, slot information, and performance metrics such as transactions per second (TPS). Additionally, the file includes functions for handling peer-related updates and requests, such as node information, gossip updates, and viewport changes. The header file ensures that these functions are available for use in other parts of the program by including necessary dependencies like `fd_gui.h`.
