Defines seccomp policy rules for logging and HTTP server operations using file descriptors.

# Purpose
This configuration file defines the behavior of a system that manages logging and HTTP server operations. It specifies file descriptors for logging (`logfile_fd`) and GUI socket operations (`gui_socket_fd`). The file outlines rules for writing log messages, where messages of 'WARNING' level and above are directed to STDERR, and all messages are written to a log file. It also details the conditions under which the log file is synchronized to disk using `fsync`. For HTTP server operations, the file describes how connections are accepted, read from, written to, and closed, using the `accept4`, `read`, `sendto`, and `close` operations. These operations are restricted to specific file descriptors, ensuring that only valid client connections are processed, while excluding the log file, STDOUT, and the listening socket. The `ppoll` operation is also mentioned, indicating the need to monitor multiple file descriptors for events.
# Content Summary
This configuration file defines the handling of file descriptors for logging and HTTP server operations. It specifies two main file descriptors: `logfile_fd` for logging and `gui_socket_fd` for the HTTP GUI server. 

Logging operations are detailed as follows:
- All log messages are written to a file and/or pipe. Messages with a severity of 'WARNING' and above are directed to STDERR (file descriptor 2) and are also written to the log file (file descriptor 4).
- The `fsync` operation ensures that 'WARNING' and above messages are immediately synchronized to disk for the log file.

For the HTTP server operations:
- The `accept4` function is used to accept connections on the `gui_socket_fd` with specific flags (`SOCK_CLOEXEC|SOCK_NONBLOCK`).
- The `read`, `sendto`, and `close` operations are allowed on any file descriptor that is not the log file, STDOUT, or the listening socket (`gui_socket_fd`). This ensures that these operations are performed only on connected client sockets.
- The `ppoll` function is mentioned for polling connections, though specific details are not provided.

This configuration ensures that logging and server operations are correctly managed through designated file descriptors, maintaining separation between logging and HTTP server functionalities.
