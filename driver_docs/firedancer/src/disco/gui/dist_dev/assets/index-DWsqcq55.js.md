Provides components and utilities for rendering and managing a tree map visualization in a React app.

# Purpose
This JavaScript module provides components and utilities for rendering and managing a tree map visualization within a React application. It includes components such as `S0` and `E0` for rendering individual nodes with specific styles and interactions, and the `Qr` function for computing the tree map layout based on data and configuration options. The module supports customization options like color schemes, padding adjustments, and label management, and it handles interactions such as mouse events. It uses React hooks like `useMemo`, `useCallback`, and `useEffect` to optimize performance and manage state and effects, ensuring dynamic updates in response to data changes. The module is designed to be flexible and extensible, allowing developers to integrate it into applications and customize it to meet specific needs, with utility functions supporting data manipulation and rendering logic.

- **Members**:
    - `state`: Holds the current height and width of the component.
    - `_autoSizer`: Stores a reference to the auto sizer element.
    - `_detectElementResize`: Stores a reference to the element resize detection utility.
    - `_didLogDeprecationWarning`: Indicates if the deprecation warning has been logged.
    - `_parentNode`: Stores a reference to the parent node of the component.
    - `_resizeObserver`: Stores a reference to the ResizeObserver instance.
    - `_timeoutId`: Stores the ID of the timeout for resize handling.
    - `_onResize`: Handles the resize event for the component.
    - `_setRef`: Sets the reference to the auto sizer element.
- **Description**: Extends the `m.Component` class to manage the size of a component by observing its parent node's dimensions and updating its state accordingly. It uses `ResizeObserver` or a custom resize detection utility to handle changes in size and triggers a resize event. The class also manages deprecation warnings for certain properties and provides a render method to display its children with updated dimensions.
