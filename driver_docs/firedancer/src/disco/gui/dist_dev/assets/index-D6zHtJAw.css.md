# Content Summary
The CSS file is a comprehensive stylesheet that defines a structured set of design tokens and styles for a web application. It includes variables and styles for colors, typography, spacing, and component-specific styles, supporting both light and dark themes. The file specifies custom fonts using the `@font-face` rule, including "Inter Tight" and "Roboto Mono," with URLs for WOFF and WOFF2 formats. It also defines custom font faces for "Segoe UI" and "Open Sans."

Color variables are extensively used, covering a wide range of themes and UI elements, with multiple shades and alpha variations for colors like gray, mauve, slate, and others. The file supports theme customization through data attributes, allowing dynamic theming based on user preferences or application requirements.

Typography settings include default font families, sizes, weights, line heights, and letter spacing for text elements such as headings, code, strong, emphasis, and quotes. Spacing and sizing variables ensure consistent layout across the UI, with defined container sizes and scaling options for responsive design.

The stylesheet includes styles for various UI components, such as buttons, cards, sliders, switches, and spinners, with specific styles for different states and variants. It uses media queries and feature queries to apply styles based on screen size and display capabilities, ensuring responsiveness across devices.

Animations and transitions are defined using keyframes, enhancing user interaction with smooth visual feedback. The file also includes styles for accessibility, such as focus-visible states, and uses CSS Grid and Flexbox for layout management.

Overall, this CSS file provides a structured approach to theming and styling, allowing for easy customization and consistent design across the application. Developers should be aware of the defined breakpoints, CSS variables, and specific component classes to efficiently maintain and extend the application's styling.
