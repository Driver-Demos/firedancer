Lists dependencies with their licenses, versions, authors, and repository information.

# Purpose
This document contains metadata for various software packages used in a codebase. Each entry provides essential information about a package, including its name, version, license type, and repository details. The metadata also includes author information and a brief description of the package's functionality. The licenses, such as MIT, BSD-3-Clause, and ISC, outline the terms under which the software can be used, modified, and distributed. This information is crucial for developers to understand the legal and functional aspects of the software components they are integrating into their projects. The document serves as a reference for managing dependencies and ensuring compliance with licensing requirements.
