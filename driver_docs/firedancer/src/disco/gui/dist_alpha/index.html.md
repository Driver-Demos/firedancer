HTML document for the Firedancer GUI with preloaded assets and a root div for content rendering.

# Purpose
The HTML document defines the structure and resources for a web page titled "Firedancer." It specifies the document type and language, and includes metadata such as character encoding and viewport settings for responsive design. The document preloads several assets, including fonts and SVG images, to optimize loading performance. It links to a JavaScript module and a CSS stylesheet, both of which are essential for the page's functionality and styling. The `body` contains a `div` with the `id` of `root`, which serves as a container for dynamically rendered content.
