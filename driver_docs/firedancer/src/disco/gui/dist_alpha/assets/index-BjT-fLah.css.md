Defines styles for AG Grid themes, managing layout, colors, responsiveness, and accessibility features.

# Purpose
The CSS stylesheet defines the styles for a grid component, focusing on the `ag-theme-quartz`, `ag-theme-quartz-dark`, and `ag-theme-quartz-auto-dark` themes. It includes CSS classes and variables that manage the appearance and layout of grid elements such as icons, headers, cells, tool panels, filter panels, and input fields. The stylesheet uses CSS variables to define colors, sizes, and other style properties, facilitating easy customization and theming. Media queries are included to adjust styles based on user system preferences, such as dark mode, and the styles support both left-to-right (LTR) and right-to-left (RTL) text directions for language compatibility. This file is essential for ensuring the grid component renders correctly and consistently across different environments and themes, influencing user interaction and data presentation.
