# Purpose
The CSS file defines a comprehensive set of custom properties and styles for a web application's design system, ensuring a consistent look and feel across the user interface. It includes variables for colors, fonts, spacing, and other design tokens, supporting both light and dark themes for dynamic theme switching. The file organizes styles by color themes and UI components, such as buttons, cards, and navigation elements, with different states and variants. Media queries are used to ensure responsive design across various devices, and animations and transitions enhance user interaction. The use of CSS classes with prefixes like `rt-` suggests a structured, modular approach, centralizing styling logic for easy maintenance and customization.
# Content Summary
The CSS file is a comprehensive stylesheet that defines styles and variables for a web application, ensuring a consistent and responsive user interface. It includes configurations for fonts, colors, themes, and various UI components, supporting both light and dark modes.

**Font and Typography**: The file specifies custom fonts using the `@font-face` rule, including "Inter Tight" and "Roboto Mono" with a weight of 400. It sets default font families, sizes, weights, line heights, and letter spacing for text elements like headings, code, and emphasized text.

**Color and Theme Management**: The stylesheet defines a wide range of color variables for different themes, such as gray, mauve, slate, and olive. These colors are specified in both hexadecimal and `color(display-p3)` formats. CSS custom properties are used to support light and dark themes, allowing easy theme switching with selectors like `:root`, `.light`, and `.dark`.

**Component Styles and Customization**: The file includes styles for UI components such as buttons, cards, sliders, and switches, with variables controlling aspects like box shadows and blend modes. It also defines accent colors for detailed UI customization and includes state-based styles for interactive elements.

**Responsive Design**: Media queries and scaling variables are used to ensure the UI adapts to different screen sizes. Classes like `.xs`, `.sm`, `.md`, `.lg`, and `.xl` apply styles at various breakpoints, while scaling factors adjust element sizes for responsive design.

**Layout and Positioning**: The stylesheet uses CSS Grid and Flexbox for layout management, with classes for grid columns, rows, and flex alignment. Positioning classes manage element placement, and utility classes provide additional layout control.

**Animations and Transitions**: Keyframes and transitions are defined for animations like fade-in, fade-out, and sliding effects, enhancing user interactions with smooth visual transitions.

**Accessibility and User Experience**: The file includes styles for focus states and cursor styles to improve accessibility. Utility classes for overflow, table layout, and text wrapping enhance content display and layout management.

Overall, this CSS file provides a structured approach to styling a web application, with extensive support for theming, responsive design, and UI component customization, ensuring a consistent and flexible design system.
