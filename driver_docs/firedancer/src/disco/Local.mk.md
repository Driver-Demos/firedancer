Makefile for building and testing the `fd_disco` library and its unit tests.

# Purpose
The `Makefile` content defines build and test instructions for the `fd_disco` library. It uses a macro `make-lib` to create the library and `add-hdrs` to include the headers `fd_disco_base.h` and `fd_disco.h`. It also specifies a unit test `test_disco_base` using the `make-unit-test` macro, which depends on the `fd_disco`, `fd_tango`, and `fd_util` libraries. Finally, it runs the unit test `test_disco_base` with the `run-unit-test` macro.
