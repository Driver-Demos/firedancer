Defines the `fd_shred_dest_wire` structure with network-related fields and includes related headers.

# Purpose
This C header file defines the structure `fd_shred_dest_wire` and includes several other header files that are necessary for its functionality. The `fd_shred_dest_wire` structure is packed and contains a public key, a versioning union, an IPv4 address, and a UDP port. The versioning union allows access to version information either as a single `ulong` or as a set of four `ushort` components: `version_patch`, `version_minor`, `version_major`, and `version_client_id`. The file also includes headers from different directories, which provide additional dependencies and functionalities, such as `fd_stem.h`, `fd_metrics.h`, `fd_pcap_replay.h`, and `fd_types_custom.h`. The comment in the structure indicates that the `ip4_addr` is stored in network byte order.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `stem/fd_stem.h`
- `metrics/fd_metrics.h`
- `pcap/fd_pcap_replay.h`
- `../flamenco/types/fd_types_custom.h`


# Data Structures

---
### fd\_shred\_dest\_wire
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - ``pubkey``: An array of `fd_pubkey_t` that holds a single public key.
    - ``version``: A union that can store a `ulong` version number or a structured version with patch, minor, major, and client ID components.
    - ``version_patch``: A `ushort` representing the patch version number.
    - ``version_minor``: A `ushort` representing the minor version number.
    - ``version_major``: A `ushort` representing the major version number.
    - ``version_client_id``: A `ushort` representing the client ID version number.
    - ``ip4_addr``: A `uint` representing an IPv4 address in network byte order.
    - ``udp_port``: A `ushort` representing a UDP port number.
- **Description**: Defines a packed data structure for network communication, containing a public key, version information (either as a single `ulong` or detailed components), an IPv4 address, and a UDP port, with the `ip4_addr` stored in network byte order.

### fd\_shred\_dest\_wire\_t
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - ``pubkey``: An array of `fd_pubkey_t` with a single element.
    - ``version``: A union member that can be accessed as a single `ulong` or as a structured set of `ushort` values.
    - ``version_patch``: A `ushort` representing the patch version.
    - ``version_minor``: A `ushort` representing the minor version.
    - ``version_major``: A `ushort` representing the major version.
    - ``version_client_id``: A `ushort` representing the client ID version.
    - ``ip4_addr``: A `uint` representing an IPv4 address in network byte order.
    - ``udp_port``: A `ushort` representing a UDP port number.
- **Description**: Defines a packed structure for wire format data that includes a public key, versioning information, an IPv4 address, and a UDP port. The versioning information can be accessed as a single `ulong` or as individual components for patch, minor, major, and client ID versions. The structure is designed for network communication, with the IPv4 address stored in network byte order.
