Makefile logic to conditionally add objects for `fd_sign_tile` and `fd_disco` if `FD_HAS_ALLOCA` is defined.

# Purpose
The `Makefile` snippet conditionally adds object files to the build process. If the macro `FD_HAS_ALLOCA` is defined, the `add-objs` function is called with the arguments `fd_sign_tile` and `fd_disco`, which adds these object files to the build targets. This conditional inclusion allows for flexibility in the build process based on the presence of the `FD_HAS_ALLOCA` definition.
