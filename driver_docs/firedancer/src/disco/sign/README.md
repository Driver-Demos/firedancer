Signing tile implementation, seccomp filter policy, security policies, and Makefile logic for SSE support.

## Folders
- **[generated](generated/README.md)**: Defines a seccomp filter policy for syscall control based on architecture and specific syscalls.

## Files
- **[fd_sign_tile.c](fd_sign_tile.c.md)**: Implements a signing tile for Firedancer, handling key management, signing operations, and security checks.
- **[fd_sign_tile.seccomppolicy](fd_sign_tile.seccomppolicy.md)**: Defines security policies for logging, including file descriptor management and log message handling.
- **[Local.mk](Local.mk.md)**: Makefile logic to conditionally add objects for `fd_sign_tile` and `fd_disco` if `FD_HAS_ALLOCA` is defined.
