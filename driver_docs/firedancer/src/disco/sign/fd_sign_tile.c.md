Implements a signing tile for Firedancer, handling key management, signing operations, and security checks.

# Purpose
The code is a C module that implements a signing tile for a distributed system. It is designed to handle cryptographic signing operations using the Ed25519 algorithm. The module defines several structures, such as `fd_sign_ctx_t`, which holds the context for signing operations, including public and private keys, signing contexts, and metrics for signing duration. The code includes functions for initializing the signing context, handling incoming fragments, and performing signing operations based on different signing types. It also manages key switching and ensures that the public key matches the derived key from the private key to prevent potential security issues.

The module is part of a larger system and interacts with other components through defined interfaces. It includes functions for both privileged and unprivileged initialization, which set up the necessary context and resources for signing operations. The code also defines callback functions for housekeeping, metrics writing, and fragment processing, which are integrated into a larger framework using the `fd_stem.c` library. The module is configured to run as a tile in a distributed topology, with specific functions to populate allowed system calls and file descriptors for security purposes.
