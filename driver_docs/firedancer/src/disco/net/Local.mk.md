Makefile logic for adding headers and objects if `FD_HAS_ALLOCA` is defined.

# Purpose
The `Makefile` snippet uses conditional directives to manage the inclusion of headers and object files based on the presence of the `FD_HAS_ALLOCA` macro. If `FD_HAS_ALLOCA` is defined, it adds `fd_net_tile.h` to the list of headers and includes `fd_net_tile_topo` and `fd_disco` in the list of object files. This configuration helps in controlling the build process by conditionally compiling specific components.
