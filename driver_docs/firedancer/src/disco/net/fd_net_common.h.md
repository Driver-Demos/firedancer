Common definitions for network tile implementations, including the size of a repair protocol ping packet.

# Purpose
The `fd_net_common.h` file is a C header file that provides common definitions for network tile implementations. It defines a constant, `REPAIR_PING_SZ`, which specifies the size of a ping packet used in the repair protocol. This size is important because ping packets are routed to the same port as shreds, and the packet size is used to interpret the payload. The definition ensures that the size of a ping packet does not conflict with the sizes of valid shreds, which are defined elsewhere as `FD_SHRED_MAX_SZ` and `FD_SHRED_MIN_SZ`.
