Defines seccomp policy rules for logging and XDP socket operations in a network application.

# Purpose
This configuration file defines the handling of file descriptors and logging mechanisms for a system that uses eXpress Data Path (XDP) sockets. It specifies file descriptors for logging and XDP sockets, including `logfile_fd`, `xsk_fd`, and `lo_xsk_fd`, which are used for logging and network communication. The file outlines the conditions under which log messages are written to STDERR or a log file, and when the log file is synchronized to disk. It also details the use of system calls like `sendto` and `recvmsg` to notify the kernel about new entries in the TX and fill rings of XDP sockets, which is necessary for efficient packet processing. Additionally, it describes the use of `getsockopt` to retrieve packet drop statistics from the XDP socket, ensuring that the system can monitor and manage network performance effectively.
# Content Summary
The provided content describes configuration and operational details for handling logging and network communication using XDP (eXpress Data Path) sockets in a software system. Here are the key functional details:

1. **File Descriptors**: 
   - `logfile_fd`, `xsk_fd`, and `lo_xsk_fd` are unsigned integer file descriptors. `logfile_fd` is used for logging purposes, while `xsk_fd` and `lo_xsk_fd` are associated with XDP sockets for the primary network device and the loopback device, respectively.

2. **Logging Configuration**:
   - All log messages are written to a file and/or a pipe. Messages with a severity of 'WARNING' and above are directed to the STDERR pipe (file descriptor 2), while all messages are logged to the file (file descriptor 4).
   - For messages of 'WARNING' level and above, the log file is immediately synchronized to disk using the `fsync` operation on file descriptor 3.

3. **XDP Socket Operations**:
   - **Sendto**: The `sendto` syscall is used to notify the kernel of new entries in the TX ring. This is necessary because the kernel does not automatically poll the TX queue. The syscall is configured to operate on either `xsk_fd` or `lo_xsk_fd` with specific arguments to ensure non-blocking operation (`MSG_DONTWAIT`).
   - **Recvmsg**: The `recvmsg` syscall is used to notify the kernel when the fill ring is replenished, as the kernel does not poll the fill ring when `XDP_USE_NEED_WAKEUP` is used. This operation also targets either `xsk_fd` or `lo_xsk_fd` with non-blocking settings.
   - **Getsockopt**: The `getsockopt` syscall is used to retrieve packet drop statistics from the XDP socket. It operates on either `xsk_fd` or `lo_xsk_fd` with specific options (`SOL_XDP` and `XDP_STATISTICS`).

These configurations ensure efficient logging and network packet handling by leveraging XDP sockets and specific system calls to manage data flow and system notifications.
