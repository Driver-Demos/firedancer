Makefile for building and testing XDP tile components with conditional sandbox support.

# Purpose
This Makefile script conditionally adds object files and defines unit tests based on the presence of certain features. If `FD_HAS_ALLOCA` is defined, it adds the object files `fd_xdp_tile` and `fd_disco`. If `FD_ARCH_SUPPORTS_SANDBOX` is also defined, it creates and runs unit tests `test_xdp_tile` and `test_xdp_tile1`, which depend on various components such as `fd_disco`, `fd_tango`, `fd_waltz`, and others. The script ensures that these tests are only executed when the necessary architecture and feature support are available.
