Defines seccomp policy rules for logging and network packet transmission and reception.

# Purpose
The content defines a set of rules and configurations for handling network communication and logging within a software system. It specifies file descriptors for logging (`logfile_fd`), transmission (`tx_fd`), and reception (`rx_fd0`, `rx_fd1`) of data. The `ppoll` function is used to check for network completions, while `recvmmsg` and `sendmmsg` functions manage the receipt and transmission of network packets, respectively, with specific conditions on arguments such as file descriptors and message flags. Logging is configured to write all messages to a log file, with messages of 'WARNING' level and above also directed to the STDERR pipe. The `write` function ensures that log messages are written to the correct file descriptors, and the `fsync` function is used to immediately synchronize 'WARNING' level messages and above to disk, ensuring data integrity.
