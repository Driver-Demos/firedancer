Tests for memory protection and fork behavior in the `fd_keyload` module.

# Purpose
The code is a C program designed to test memory protection mechanisms, specifically focusing on the behavior of protected memory pages. It includes the header `fd_keyload.h` and uses system calls and macros to manage processes and handle signals. The program defines a macro `TEST_FORK_OK` to facilitate the creation of child processes using `fork()`, and it checks the exit status of these processes to ensure they terminate correctly without errors or signals.

The function `test_protected_pages` is the core component of the program. It tests the allocation and protection of memory pages using the function `fd_keyload_alloc_protected_pages`. The function verifies that accessing memory outside the allocated range triggers a segmentation fault, as expected. It also checks that memory is correctly initialized to zero and that changes to memory in a child process do not affect the parent process due to memory protection. The `main` function initializes logging, calls `test_protected_pages`, and logs the test results. This program is intended to be executed as a standalone test suite to validate the behavior of memory protection features.
