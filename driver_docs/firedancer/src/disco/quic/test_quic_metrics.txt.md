Metrics for tracking QUIC transactions, connections, packets, and performance in the Firedancer codebase.

# Purpose
The file contains metrics definitions for monitoring QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections) protocol operations. Each metric is defined with a `# HELP` comment that describes the purpose of the metric, followed by a `# TYPE` line that specifies the metric type, such as `counter` or `gauge`. The metrics track various aspects of QUIC operations, including transaction counts, connection states, packet handling, and error occurrences. These metrics are essential for performance monitoring and troubleshooting in systems that use the QUIC protocol. The metrics are categorized by their function, such as transaction handling, connection management, packet processing, and error tracking, providing a comprehensive view of the QUIC protocol's performance and reliability within the application.
# Content Summary
The provided content is a configuration file that defines various metrics related to QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections) protocol operations. These metrics are used for monitoring and analyzing the performance and behavior of QUIC connections. Each metric is associated with a specific type, such as a counter, gauge, or histogram, and is identified by a unique name and a set of labels.

Key metrics include:

1. **Transaction Metrics**: These metrics track the number of transactions (txns) that are overrun, started, active, received, abandoned, undersized, and oversized. They provide insights into the transaction handling and potential issues like data gaps or duplicate fragments.

2. **Fragment Metrics**: Metrics such as `quic_frags_ok`, `quic_frags_gap`, and `quic_frags_dup` count the number of transaction fragments received, dropped due to data gaps, and dropped due to duplication, respectively.

3. **Connection Metrics**: These metrics include the number of connections allocated, created, closed, aborted, timed out, and retried. They also track connection errors, such as those due to lack of slots or retry failures.

4. **Packet Metrics**: Metrics like `quic_received_packets`, `quic_sent_packets`, `quic_pkt_no_conn`, and `quic_pkt_crypto_failed` provide information on packet handling, including the number of packets received, sent, and those with unknown connection IDs or failed decryption.

5. **Frame and Stream Metrics**: These metrics track the number of QUIC frames received, failed to parse, and stream events, as well as the total stream payload bytes received.

6. **Duration Metrics**: Histograms such as `quic_service_duration_seconds` and `quic_receive_duration_seconds` measure the time spent in service and processing packets, respectively.

7. **Error Metrics**: Metrics like `quic_pkt_net_header_invalid` and `quic_pkt_quic_header_invalid` count packets dropped due to invalid headers, while `quic_pkt_undersz` and `quic_pkt_oversz` track packets dropped due to size issues.

Each metric is labeled with attributes such as `kind`, `kind_id`, and other specific identifiers to categorize and differentiate the data. This configuration is essential for developers and system administrators to monitor QUIC protocol performance and diagnose issues effectively.
