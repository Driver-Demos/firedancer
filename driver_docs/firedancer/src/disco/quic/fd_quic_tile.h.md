Defines the `fd_quic_ctx_t` structure and related constants for QUIC tile operations in Firedancer.

# Purpose
This C header file defines the structure and components necessary for managing a QUIC tile in a networked environment. It includes several header files that provide necessary types and functions, such as `fd_tpu.h`, `fd_stem.h`, `fd_topo.h`, `fd_net_tile.h`, `fd_quic.h`, and `fd_io.h`. The file defines a constant `FD_QUIC_TILE_IN_MAX` to specify the maximum number of input bounds for the QUIC tile. It declares an external variable `fd_tile_quic` of type `fd_topo_run_tile_t`, which likely represents a runnable tile in the network topology. The `fd_quic_ctx_t` structure encapsulates various components required for QUIC operations, including pointers to reassembly and stem contexts, timing and clock information, cryptographic keys, network buffers, and metrics for tracking network transactions and reassembly statistics. This structure is designed to facilitate the handling of QUIC protocol operations, including transaction reception and processing, within a network tile.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `fd_tpu.h`
- `../stem/fd_stem.h`
- `../topo/fd_topo.h`
- `../net/fd_net_tile.h`
- `../../waltz/quic/fd_quic.h`

# Global Variables

---
### fd\_tile\_quic
- **Type**: ``fd_topo_run_tile_t``
- **Description**: `fd_tile_quic` is a global variable of type `fd_topo_run_tile_t`. It is declared as an external variable, indicating that it is defined elsewhere in the program.
- **Use**: Used to represent a QUIC tile in the topology, facilitating QUIC protocol operations.
