Tests QUIC metrics rendering and validation using a mock HTTP server and Prometheus integration.

# Purpose
The code is an executable C program designed to test the functionality of a QUIC metrics system. It imports several header files related to metrics and HTTP server operations, indicating its focus on network performance monitoring and data handling. The program initializes a deterministic test environment by setting a specific tick rate and configuring HTTP server parameters, such as maximum connection counts and buffer sizes. It then allocates memory for both the HTTP server and metrics, joining them to their respective structures.

The program writes fake metric values to simulate real-world data and uses these metrics to render a Prometheus-compatible output. It stages an HTTP response and compares the generated metrics data against a fixture file to verify correctness. If the data does not match, it updates the fixture file and logs an error. The program concludes by cleaning up allocated resources and halting execution. This code is primarily used for testing and validating the accuracy of metrics generation and rendering in a controlled environment.

Initializes and runs an HTTP server to render and verify metrics, then outputs the results.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments.
    - `argv`: An array of command-line argument strings.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Calls `fd_boot` to initialize the environment with command-line arguments.
    - Sets the tempo tick rate to make the test deterministic using `fd_tempo_set_tick_per_ns`.
    - Defines HTTP server parameters in `fd_http_server_params_t` with specific limits for connections and buffer sizes.
    - Initializes HTTP server callbacks with `fd_http_server_callbacks_t`.
    - Allocates memory for the HTTP server using `aligned_alloc` and initializes it with `fd_http_server_new` and `fd_http_server_join`.
    - Allocates memory for metrics and initializes them with `fd_metrics_new` and `fd_metrics_join`.
    - Writes fake metric values into the metrics memory.
    - Creates a `fd_topo_tile_t` structure with the name 'quic' and the metrics data.
    - Renders the metrics into the HTTP server using `fd_prometheus_render_tile`.
    - Prepares the HTTP server response body with `fd_http_server_stage_body`.
    - Extracts the response body and its length from the HTTP server response.
    - Outputs the response body to the standard output using `puts` and `fwrite`.
    - Checks if the response body matches the expected metrics fixture; if not, writes the body to a file and logs an error.
    - Frees the allocated memory for metrics and HTTP server using `fd_metrics_delete`, `fd_metrics_leave`, `fd_http_server_delete`, and `fd_http_server_leave`.
    - Calls `fd_halt` to terminate the program.
- **Output**: Returns 0 to indicate successful execution.
