Makefile for adding headers, objects, and unit tests for QUIC-related components in the Firedancer project.

# Purpose
The Makefile content defines build and test instructions for a software project. It uses the `add-hdrs` and `add-objs` functions to include header files and object files, such as `fd_tpu.h` and `fd_tpu_reasm`, into the build process. The `make-unit-test` and `run-unit-test` functions are used to create and execute unit tests, specifically `test_tpu_reasm` and `test_quic_metrics`, with dependencies on various modules like `fd_disco` and `fd_util`. Conditional directives, such as `ifdef FD_HAS_DOUBLE` and `ifdef FD_HAS_ALLOCA`, control the inclusion of additional tests and files based on the presence of specific features or configurations. The file also specifies a dependency rule for the object file `test_quic_metrics.o`, indicating it depends on the source file `test_quic_metrics.txt`.
