A program to replay PCAP files using shared memory and command-line configurations.

# Purpose
The code is an executable C program designed to replay packets from a PCAP file. It uses several command-line arguments to configure its operation, such as `--cnc`, `--pcap`, `--pkt-max`, `--orig`, `--mcache`, `--dcache`, `--out-fseqs`, `--cr-max`, `--lazy`, and `--seed`. These arguments specify the paths to various resources and parameters that control the packet replay process. The program initializes by joining shared memory regions and setting up necessary resources like caches and sequence files. It then creates a random number generator and allocates memory for scratch space required for the replay operation.

The main functionality is executed by calling the `fd_pcap_replay_tile` function, which handles the actual packet replay using the provided configurations. The program logs its progress and checks for errors at each step, ensuring that all resources are correctly joined and released. If any step fails, it logs an error and halts execution. The program concludes by releasing all acquired resources and halting the system. The code is structured to support different build targets, but currently, it only implements functionality for hosted environments, as indicated by the `#if FD_HAS_HOSTED` preprocessor directive.

Initializes the environment and logs a warning for unsupported build targets before halting execution.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The count of command-line arguments.
    - `argv`: The array of command-line arguments.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Call `fd_boot` to initialize the environment with `argc` and `argv`.
    - Log a warning message indicating that support for the current build target is not implemented.
    - Call `fd_halt` to stop the program execution.
    - Return 1 to indicate unsuccessful execution.
- **Output**: Returns an integer value of 1, indicating unsuccessful execution.
