Defines a seccomp filter policy for syscall control based on architecture and specific syscalls.

# Purpose
The code is a C header file that defines a seccomp (secure computing mode) filter policy for a specific architecture. It includes necessary headers for seccomp and BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter) operations and defines architecture-specific constants to ensure compatibility with the target system architecture. The file contains a function, [`populate_sock_filter_policy_fd_plugin_tile`](<#populate_sock_filter_policy_fd_plugin_tile>), which initializes a BPF filter array with specific rules to control system call access. The filter checks the architecture and allows or denies specific system calls, such as `SYS_write` and `SYS_fsync`, based on predefined conditions. If the conditions are not met, the process is terminated using `SECCOMP_RET_KILL_PROCESS`.

The header file is generated automatically and should not be edited manually. It is intended to be included in other C source files that require seccomp filtering functionality. The filter policy is designed to enhance security by restricting the system calls that a process can make, thus reducing the attack surface. The file uses macros and conditional compilation to support multiple architectures, such as `i386`, `x86_64`, and `aarch64`, and it defines a static constant for the number of instructions in the filter.

### sock\_filter\_policy\_fd\_plugin\_tile\_instr\_cnt
- **Type**: ``unsigned int``
- **Description**: A static constant variable that holds the number of instructions in a socket filter policy for a plugin tile.
- **Use**: Used to define the size of the `filter` array in the `populate_sock_filter_policy_fd_plugin_tile` function.

Populates a `sock_filter` array with a seccomp filter policy to control system call permissions based on architecture and specific file descriptors.
- **Inputs**:
    - `out_cnt`: The number of elements in the `out` array, expected to be at least 14.
    - `out`: A pointer to an array of `sock_filter` structures where the filter policy will be stored.
    - `logfile_fd`: The file descriptor to be allowed for certain system calls like `write` and `fsync`.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Check if `out_cnt` is at least 14 using `FD_TEST` macro.
    - Define a `sock_filter` array `filter` with 14 elements to specify the seccomp filter policy.
    - Load the architecture from `seccomp_data` and compare it with `ARCH_NR`; if not equal, jump to `RET_KILL_PROCESS`.
    - Load the syscall number and check if it is `SYS_write` or `SYS_fsync`; if not, jump to `RET_KILL_PROCESS`.
    - For `SYS_write`, load the first syscall argument and check if it is 2 or `logfile_fd`; if not, jump to `RET_KILL_PROCESS`.
    - For `SYS_fsync`, load the first syscall argument and check if it is `logfile_fd`; if not, jump to `RET_KILL_PROCESS`.
    - If none of the conditions are met, execute `RET_KILL_PROCESS`.
    - Copy the `filter` array to the `out` array using `fd_memcpy`.
- **Output**: The `out` array is populated with a seccomp filter policy that allows or kills processes based on the specified conditions.
