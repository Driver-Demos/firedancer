Makefile logic to conditionally add objects based on the presence of 128-bit integer support.

# Purpose
The `Makefile` snippet conditionally adds object files to the build process. If the macro `FD_HAS_INT128` is defined, it invokes the `add-objs` function to include the object files `fd_plugin_tile`, `fd_disco`, and `fd_flamenco` in the build. This ensures that these components are only compiled when the system supports 128-bit integers.
