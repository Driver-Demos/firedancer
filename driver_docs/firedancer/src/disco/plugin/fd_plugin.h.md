Defines message types and structures for plugin communication in the Firedancer codebase.

# Purpose
The code is a C header file that defines a set of constants, data structures, and types for a plugin system. It provides message type identifiers, such as `FD_PLUGIN_MSG_SLOT_ROOTED` and `FD_PLUGIN_MSG_GOSSIP_UPDATE`, which are used to categorize different types of messages within the plugin framework. These identifiers are represented as macros with unique unsigned long values. The file also defines several data structures, such as `fd_plugin_msg_slot_start_t`, `fd_plugin_msg_slot_end_t`, `fd_replay_complete_msg_t`, `fd_gossip_update_msg_t`, and `fd_vote_update_msg_t`, which are used to encapsulate data related to various message types. These structures are packed and aligned to ensure efficient memory usage and data access.

The header file also includes static assertions to verify the size of certain structures, ensuring they conform to expected sizes. Additionally, it defines constants related to the configuration of the system, such as `FD_CLUSTER_NODE_CNT` and `FD_GOSSIP_UPDATE_MSG_NUM_SOCKETS`. The file is intended to be included in other C source files that require access to these message types and structures, facilitating communication and data exchange within a distributed system or network. The use of macros and packed structures suggests a focus on performance and interoperability in a networked environment.
