Makefile logic for adding headers and objects based on platform and threading conditions.

# Purpose
The `Makefile` content uses conditional directives to manage the inclusion of headers and object files based on specific conditions. If the macros `FD_HAS_HOSTED`, `FD_HAS_THREADS`, and `FD_HAS_LINUX` are defined, it calls the `add-hdrs` function to include the `fd_topo.h` header file and the `add-objs` function to include the object files `fd_topo`, `fd_topob`, `fd_cpu_topo`, and `fd_topo_run` in the `fd_disco` target. This setup ensures that the build process only includes these files when the specified conditions are met.
