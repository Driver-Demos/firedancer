Defines the `fd_netlink_tile_ctx` structure for managing network link, route, and neighbor updates.

# Purpose
This C header file defines a private context structure, `fd_netlink_tile_ctx_t`, used for managing network link and route updates in a system. It includes several header files that provide necessary types and functions for network operations, such as `fd_netlink1.h`, `fd_metrics_netlnk.h`, and others related to network devices, routing, and neighbor management. The structure contains fields for managing netlink monitors, pending actions, rate limiting of updates, and tables for network devices, routes, and neighbors. It also includes a set of metrics to track synchronization and update activities. The `FD_NETLINK_TILE_CTX_MAGIC` macro is used to uniquely identify instances of this context structure, ensuring integrity and version control.
