Defines file descriptors and seccomp policies for logging, ARP probes, and rtnetlink socket operations.

# Purpose
The configuration file defines several file descriptors and their associated operations for logging and network communication. The `logfile_fd` is used to write log messages to a file, while `nl_mon_fd` and `nl_req_fd` are rtnetlink sockets for monitoring updates and handling request-reply communication, respectively. The `arp_probe_fd` is a UDP socket for generating ARP probes. Logging operations ensure that messages of 'WARNING' level and above are written to STDERR and the log file, with immediate disk synchronization for critical messages. Network operations include sending and receiving data through the defined sockets, with specific conditions for each operation to ensure proper communication and monitoring.
