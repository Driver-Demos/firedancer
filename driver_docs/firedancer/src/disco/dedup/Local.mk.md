Makefile configuration for conditional object addition and unit test setup in the deduplication module.

# Purpose
The `Makefile` snippet conditionally adds object files to the build process if the `FD_HAS_ALLOCA` macro is defined. It uses the `add-objs` function to include `fd_dedup_tile` and `fd_disco` in the build. The commented line suggests a unit test target `test_dedup` that would depend on `fd_disco`, `fd_tango`, and `fd_util`, but it is not active in the current configuration.
