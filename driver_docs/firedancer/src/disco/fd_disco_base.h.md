Defines constants, functions, and macros for network packet handling and signature generation in the Firedancer codebase.

# Purpose
The code is a C header file that defines constants, macros, and inline functions related to network packet processing and signature generation for a system. It includes several other header files, indicating dependencies on modules such as `fd_tango`, `fd_shred`, `fd_txn`, `fd_types_custom`, and `fd_wksp_private`. The file defines various maximum transmission unit (MTU) sizes for different types of network packets, such as `FD_NET_MTU`, `FD_TPU_MTU`, and `FD_GOSSIP_MTU`, which are used to manage packet sizes in the network.

The file also provides a set of inline functions for creating and extracting information from different types of signatures used in the system. These signatures are used to encode and decode metadata about network packets, such as protocol type, slot numbers, and packet types. Functions like [`fd_disco_netmux_sig`](<#fd_disco_netmux_sig>), [`fd_disco_poh_sig`](<#fd_disco_poh_sig>), and [`fd_disco_shred_out_shred_sig`](<#fd_disco_shred_out_shred_sig>) are examples of how the code handles signature creation and extraction. The file uses static assertions to ensure that certain constants and calculations are correct, preventing circular dependencies and ensuring consistency across the system. Overall, the header file serves as a utility for managing network packet metadata and ensuring efficient packet processing within the system.

    - Returns the casted result.
- **Output**: Returns a `ushort` representing the `parent_off` field extracted from the `sig`.

### fd\_disco\_repair\_replay\_sig\_data\_cnt<!-- {{#callable:fd_disco_repair_replay_sig_data_cnt}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../src/disco/fd_disco_base.h#L259>)

Extracts the data count from a signature by extracting bits 1 to 15.
- **Inputs**:
    - `sig`: An unsigned long integer representing the signature from which to extract the data count.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Calls the function `fd_ulong_extract` with parameters `sig`, `1`, and `15` to extract bits 1 to 15 from the signature.
    - Casts the result of `fd_ulong_extract` to an unsigned integer.
- **Output**: Returns an unsigned integer representing the extracted data count from the signature.

### fd\_disco\_repair\_replay\_sig\_slot\_complete<!-- {{#callable:fd_disco_repair_replay_sig_slot_complete}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../src/disco/fd_disco_base.h#L260>)

Extracts the least significant bit from the given `sig` value to determine if a slot is complete.
- **Inputs**:
    - `sig`: An unsigned long integer representing a signature from which the function extracts a specific bit.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Calls the function `fd_ulong_extract_bit` with `sig` and `0` as arguments to extract the least significant bit.
    - Returns the result of the `fd_ulong_extract_bit` function call.
- **Output**: An integer representing the least significant bit of `sig`, indicating the completion status of a slot.

### fd\_disco\_compact\_chunk0<!-- {{#callable:fd_disco_compact_chunk0}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../src/disco/fd_disco_base.h#L262>)

Calculates the compacted chunk index from a workspace pointer.
- **Inputs**:
    - `wksp`: A pointer to a `struct fd_wksp_private` which contains the `gaddr_lo` field.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Cast the `wksp` pointer to a `struct fd_wksp_private` pointer.
    - Access the `gaddr_lo` field from the casted structure.
    - Right shift the `gaddr_lo` value by `FD_CHUNK_LG_SZ` bits.
- **Output**: Returns an `ulong` representing the compacted chunk index.

### fd\_disco\_compact\_wmark<!-- {{#callable:fd_disco_compact_wmark}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../src/disco/fd_disco_base.h#L267>)

Calculates a watermark for a workspace based on the given maximum transmission unit (MTU).
- **Inputs**:
    - ``wksp``: A pointer to a `fd_wksp_private` structure representing the workspace.
    - ``mtu``: An unsigned long integer representing the maximum transmission unit.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Calculate `chunk_mtu` by adjusting `mtu` with `FD_CHUNK_SZ` and `FD_CHUNK_LG_SZ` constants.
    - Retrieve the high address (`gaddr_hi`) from the `wksp` structure.
    - Shift `wksp_hi` right by `FD_CHUNK_LG_SZ` bits.
    - Subtract `chunk_mtu` from the shifted `wksp_hi` to get the watermark.
- **Output**: Returns an unsigned long integer representing the calculated watermark.
