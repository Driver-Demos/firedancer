Defines a perfect hash table for special addresses that cannot be written to, ensuring transaction rejection.

# Purpose
The code defines a header file that specifies a perfect hash table for managing a list of special addresses that are not allowed to be written to. This functionality is crucial for ensuring that any transaction attempting to write to these specified accounts is immediately rejected. The header file uses a perfect hash function to efficiently map these addresses, ensuring that the hash table is compact and fits within the specified constraints. The hash function is defined with two terms to accommodate the table's fullness, and it uses specific constants for hashing operations.

The header file includes a list of system variables and program identifiers that are considered unwritable. These identifiers are defined as macros, such as `SYSVAR_CLOCK_ID` and `BPF_LOADER_2_PROG_ID`, and are used to populate the hash table. The file also includes a template from `fd_map_perfect.c` to implement the perfect hash table logic. This header file is intended to be included in other C source files that require the functionality of checking and rejecting transactions based on unwritable addresses. It does not define public APIs or external interfaces but provides internal mechanisms for address validation within a larger system.
