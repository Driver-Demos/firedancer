Tests for the `fd_pack_rebate_sum` functionality, including transaction creation and rebate calculations.

# Purpose
The code is an executable C program that tests the functionality of a transaction rebate system. It includes the headers `fd_pack_rebate_sum.h` and `fd_pack.h`, which suggest that it relies on external definitions for handling transaction rebates and packing operations. The program defines several macros for transaction flags, such as `VOTE`, `BUNDLE`, `IB`, `SANITIZE`, and `EXECUTE`, which are used to control the behavior of transactions within the test cases.

The main components of the code include the [`fake_transaction`](<#fake_transaction>) function, which simulates transactions by setting various transaction parameters, and the [`check_writer`](<#check_writer>) function, which verifies the correctness of writer rebates. The [`main`](<#main>) function initializes the system, creates and processes multiple fake transactions, and checks the results using assertions (`FD_TEST`). The program uses a structure `fd_pack_rebate_sum_t` to accumulate and report rebate summaries, and it tests different scenarios by adding transactions to this structure and verifying the expected outcomes. The code is structured to validate the transaction processing logic, including handling of different transaction flags and ensuring correct rebate calculations.

### fake\_transaction<!-- {{#callable:fake_transaction}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/disco/pack/test_pack_rebate_sum.c#L10>)

Initializes a transaction structure with specified parameters and populates payloads based on input strings.
- **Inputs**:
    - `txnp`: Pointer to a `fd_txn_p_t` structure that represents the transaction.
    - `alt`: Pointer to a `fd_acct_addr_t` structure used for alternative writable data.
    - `rebate_cus`: Unsigned long integer representing the rebate customer units.
    - `flags`: Unsigned integer representing transaction flags.
    - `writable`: Constant character pointer to a string representing writable data.
    - `alt_writable`: Constant character pointer to a string representing alternative writable data.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Retrieve the transaction object from `txnp` using the `TXN` macro.
    - Set `acct_addr_cnt` in the transaction to the length of the `writable` string.
    - Initialize several transaction counters (`signature_cnt`, `readonly_signed_cnt`, `readonly_unsigned_cnt`, `acct_addr_off`) to zero.
    - Set `addr_table_adtl_cnt`, `addr_table_adtl_writable_cnt`, and `addr_table_lookup_cnt` based on the length of `alt_writable`.
    - Iterate over each character in `writable`, filling the `payload` with 32 copies of each character, and advance the `payload` pointer.
    - Iterate over each character in `alt_writable`, filling `alt` with 32 copies of each character, and advance the `alt` pointer.
    - Set `payload_sz` in `txnp` to 111.
    - Assign `flags` to `txnp->flags`.
    - Set `rebated_cus` in `txnp->bank_cu` to `rebate_cus`.
- **Output**: No return value; modifies the transaction structure pointed to by `txnp` and the alternative writable data pointed to by `alt`.

### check\_writer<!-- {{#callable:check_writer}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/disco/pack/test_pack_rebate_sum.c#L43>)

Validates that each account in the `accts` string has a corresponding writer rebate in `r` with the specified `cus` value.
- **Inputs**:
    - `r`: A pointer to a `fd_pack_rebate_t` structure containing writer rebate information.
    - `accts`: A pointer to a null-terminated string of account identifiers to check.
    - `cus`: An unsigned long integer representing the expected rebate customer value for each account.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Iterates over each character in the `accts` string until the null terminator is reached.
    - For each account character, initializes a `found` flag to 0.
    - Iterates over the `writer_rebates` array in `r` to find a matching account key.
    - If a match is found, checks that `found` is 0 using `FD_TEST`, sets `found` to 1, and verifies that the `rebate_cus` matches `cus` using `FD_TEST`.
    - After checking all writer rebates, uses `FD_TEST` to ensure that `found` is 1, indicating a match was found for the account.
    - Increments the `accts` pointer to check the next account.
- **Output**: No return value; uses `FD_TEST` to assert conditions, which may terminate the program if assertions fail.

### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/disco/pack/test_pack_rebate_sum.c#L61>)

Initializes and tests a series of fake transactions to verify the functionality of the rebate sum calculation and reporting system.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments.
    - `argv`: An array of command-line argument strings.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Calls `fd_boot` to initialize the system with command-line arguments.
    - Initializes a rebate sum structure using [`fd_pack_rebate_sum_new`](<fd_pack_rebate_sum.c.md#fd_pack_rebate_sum_new>) and `fd_pack_rebate_sum_join`.
    - Defines a union `report` to store rebate data and a `microblock` array to store transaction data.
    - Initializes an array of account addresses `alt` and a pointer array `_alt` to these addresses.
    - Creates several fake transactions using [`fake_transaction`](<#fake_transaction>) with different parameters and flags.
    - Adds transactions to the rebate sum using [`fd_pack_rebate_sum_add_txn`](<fd_pack_rebate_sum.c.md#fd_pack_rebate_sum_add_txn>) and checks the results with `FD_TEST`.
    - Reports the rebate sum using [`fd_pack_rebate_sum_report`](<fd_pack_rebate_sum.c.md#fd_pack_rebate_sum_report>) and verifies the results with `FD_TEST`.
    - Checks the writer rebates using [`check_writer`](<#check_writer>) to ensure correct rebate calculations.
    - Logs a success message with `FD_LOG_NOTICE` and halts the system with `fd_halt`.
- **Output**: Returns 0 to indicate successful execution.
- **Functions Called**:
    - [`fd_pack_rebate_sum_new`](<fd_pack_rebate_sum.c.md#fd_pack_rebate_sum_new>)
    - [`fake_transaction`](<#fake_transaction>)
    - [`fd_pack_rebate_sum_add_txn`](<fd_pack_rebate_sum.c.md#fd_pack_rebate_sum_add_txn>)
    - [`fd_pack_rebate_sum_report`](<fd_pack_rebate_sum.c.md#fd_pack_rebate_sum_report>)
    - [`check_writer`](<#check_writer>)
