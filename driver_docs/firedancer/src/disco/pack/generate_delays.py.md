Generates and writes microblock execution delay data to a binary file using Poisson process modeling.

# Purpose
This code models and calculates the optimal delay for scheduling microblocks in a transaction processing system. It uses the SageMath library to perform symbolic mathematics and numerical computations. The code defines a mathematical model where microblock execution times are a linear function of the number of transactions, with parameters `a` and `b` representing the per-microblock overhead and the marginal per-transaction cost, respectively. The transaction arrival process is modeled as a Poisson process with an expected rate `r`. The code calculates the expected throughput of transactions executed per unit time and determines the optimal waiting time `t` that maximizes this throughput.

The code iterates over possible numbers of transactions in a microblock, computes the expected throughput, and finds the optimal delay for each case using the derivative of the expected throughput function. The results are stored in a list `ns_delay`, which represents the delay in nanoseconds for each possible number of transactions. Finally, the code writes these delay values to a binary file named `pack_delay.bin` using the `struct` module. This file can be used by other components of the system to optimize microblock scheduling based on the precomputed delays.

- `struct`


# Global Variables

---
### MAX\_TXN\_PER\_MICROBLOCK
- **Type**: ``Integer``
- **Description**: Defines the maximum number of transactions that can be included in a microblock. It is set to an integer value of 31.
- **Use**: Used to limit the number of transactions processed in a microblock and in calculations related to microblock execution times.


---
### ex\_expr
- **Type**: ``Expression``
- **Description**: Represents a mathematical expression that calculates the expected value of the throughput of transactions executed over time. It uses a combination of sums and Poisson distribution to model the transaction arrival and execution times.
- **Use**: Used to compute the expected throughput of transactions in a microblock, which is then used to determine the optimal scheduling delay.


---
### a
- **Type**: `int`
- **Description**: The variable `a` is an integer that represents the per-microblock overhead in microseconds. It is used in the calculation of microblock execution times.
- **Use**: Used to model microblock execution times as part of a linear function, where it contributes to the calculation of the total time required for microblock processing.


---
### b
- **Type**: ``int``
- **Description**: The variable `b` is an integer that represents the marginal per-transaction cost in microseconds. It is used in the calculation of microblock execution times as part of a linear function.
- **Use**: Used to calculate the execution time of microblocks by adding the cost per transaction to the overhead.


---
### r
- **Type**: ``int``
- **Description**: Represents the expected rate of transaction arrival in a Poisson process, measured in transactions per microsecond. It is used to model the transaction arrival rate in the system.
- **Use**: Used in the calculation of expected throughput and microblock execution times in the `ex_expr` expression.


---
### ns\_delay
- **Type**: ``list``
- **Description**: A list that stores delay values in nanoseconds for different numbers of transactions in a microblock. The list is initialized with zeros and has a length of `MAX_TXN_PER_MICROBLOCK + 1`. The first element is set to `ULONG_MAX`, and the rest are calculated based on a Poisson distribution model.
- **Use**: Used to store and calculate the delay in nanoseconds for microblock execution times based on the number of transactions.
