Defines a blacklist for transaction tip payment programs with hash-based checks for bundle and non-bundle transactions.

# Purpose
The code is a C header file that defines a blacklist mechanism for transaction account addresses in a blockchain context. It includes definitions and macros to manage a perfect hash map, which is used to quickly determine if a given account address is blacklisted. The blacklist is divided into two categories: transactions from bundles and transactions not from bundles. The code prevents certain transactions from using the tip payment program to avoid potential attacks, such as changing the tip receiver to an unauthorized account. The blacklist includes specific account addresses for both mainnet and testnet environments, and it uses a perfect hash function to map these addresses to specific keys for efficient lookup.

The file defines a function, [`fd_pack_tip_prog_check_blacklist`](<#fd_pack_tip_prog_check_blacklist>), which checks if a transaction using a specified account address should be allowed. The function returns different values based on whether the account is allowed in any transaction, forbidden for non-bundle transactions, or forbidden for both bundle and non-bundle transactions. The return values are designed to facilitate aggregation using bitwise operations. The file also includes several macros that define the structure and behavior of the perfect hash map, including the hash function and key comparison logic. The header file is intended to be included in other C source files that require access to the blacklist functionality.

Determines if a transaction using a specified account address is allowed based on a blacklist check.
- **Inputs**:
    - `acct`: A pointer to a `fd_acct_addr_t` structure representing the account address to check.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Calculate the hash of the account address using `fd_pack_tip_prog_blacklist_hash_or_default` function.
    - Check if the hash is not equal to `UINT_MAX` and assign a value of 1 if true.
    - Check if the hash is less than or equal to 1 and assign a value of 2 if true.
    - Return the sum of the two checks, resulting in a value of 0, 1, or 3.
- **Output**: An integer value indicating the blacklist status: 0 (allowed in any transaction), 1 (forbidden for non-bundle transactions), or 3 (forbidden for both bundle and non-bundle transactions).
