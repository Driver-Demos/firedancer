Defines structures and constants for managing microblocks, including metadata and transaction limits.

# Purpose
This C header file defines structures and constants related to microblocks in a transaction processing system. It includes the `fd_entry_batch_meta` and `fd_entry_batch_header` structures, which store metadata and header information for entry batches, such as the number of skipped slots, reference ticks, and proof of history hashes. The file also defines constants like `MAX_MICROBLOCK_SZ` and `FD_POH_SHRED_MTU`, which specify size limits for microblocks and their components. These definitions are used to manage the size and structure of microblocks, ensuring they fit within specified constraints and are compatible with the system's proof of history mechanism. The file includes a static assertion to verify that the maximum transmission unit (`FD_POH_SHRED_MTU`) does not exceed the maximum allowable size (`USHORT_MAX`).

# Data Structures

---
### fd\_entry\_batch\_meta
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `parent_offset`: Indicates the number of skipped slots on which the current slot builds.
    - `reference_tick`: Represents the tick index within a slot, ranging from 0 to 64.
    - `block_complete`: Indicates if the current microblock is the last in the slot.
    - `parent_block_id`: Stores the Merkle root of the last FEC set of the parent block.
    - `parent_block_id_valid`: Indicates if the `parent_block_id` is valid.
- **Description**: Defines metadata for a batch of entries in a microblock, including information about slot continuity, tick indexing, and Merkle root chaining for data integrity.


---
### fd\_entry\_batch\_meta\_t
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - ``parent_offset``: Indicates the number of skipped slots being built upon.
    - ``reference_tick``: Represents the tick in the slot indexed from [0, ticks_per_slot].
    - ``block_complete``: Indicates whether this is the last microblock in the slot.
    - ``parent_block_id``: Stores the chained Merkle root needed by the shred tile.
    - ``parent_block_id_valid``: Indicates the validity of the `parent_block_id`.
- **Description**: The `fd_entry_batch_meta_t` structure contains metadata for a batch of entries in a microblock, including information about skipped slots, tick references, and the completion status of the block. It also includes a Merkle root for chaining purposes, although this design is noted as suboptimal. The structure is used to manage and track the state and integrity of microblocks within a blockchain system.


---
### fd\_entry\_batch\_header
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - ``hashcnt_delta``: Number of hashes since the last entry batch that was published.
    - ``hash``: Proof of history stamped hash of the entry batch.
    - ``txn_cnt``: Number of hashes in the entry batch.
- **Description**: Represents the header for an entry batch in a proof of history system, containing information about the number of hashes since the last batch, the stamped hash, and the count of transactions in the batch.

### fd\_entry\_batch\_header\_t
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `hashcnt_delta`: Number of hashes since the last entry batch that was published.
    - `hash`: Proof of history stamped hash of the entry batch.
    - `txn_cnt`: Number of hashes in the entry batch.
- **Description**: Defines the header for an entry batch in a microblock, containing information about the number of hashes since the last entry batch, the proof of history hash, and the count of transactions in the entry batch.
