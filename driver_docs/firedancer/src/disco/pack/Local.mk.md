Defines build rules and unit tests for the `firedancer` project's `disco/pack` module.

# Purpose
The content defines a set of build instructions using conditional compilation in a Makefile. It checks for the presence of certain features or architectures, such as `FD_HAS_DOUBLE`, `FD_HAS_HOSTED`, and `FD_ARCH_SUPPORTS_SANDBOX`, to conditionally include headers and object files, and to create and run unit tests and fuzz tests. The `add-hdrs` and `add-objs` functions are used to specify header files and object files that are necessary for the build process. The `make-unit-test` and `run-unit-test` functions are used to define and execute unit tests for various components, ensuring that the software behaves as expected. Additionally, `make-fuzz-test` is used to create fuzz tests, which help identify potential vulnerabilities or unexpected behavior in the code.
