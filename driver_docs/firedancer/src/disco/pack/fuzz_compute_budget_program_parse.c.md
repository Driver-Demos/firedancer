Fuzz testing for the `fd_compute_budget_program_parse` function in the Firedancer codebase.

# Purpose
The code is a fuzz testing suite designed to test the `fd_compute_budget_program` functionality. It uses the LLVM libFuzzer framework to initialize and execute tests on input data. The [`LLVMFuzzerInitialize`](<#llvmfuzzerinitialize>) function sets up the environment by configuring logging and initializing the system without signal handlers. It also registers a cleanup function to be called upon program exit. The [`LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`](<#llvmfuzzertestoneinput>) function is the core of the fuzz testing process. It takes input data and its size, checks if the data size is less than 16 bytes, and then attempts to parse the data into a `fd_compute_budget_program_state_t` structure. The function includes assertions to verify that the parsed state meets specific conditions, such as having a positive instruction count and ensuring that compute units and heap size are within defined limits.

The code includes several important components and dependencies. It relies on external utilities and headers, such as `fd_util.h` and `fd_fuzz.h`, which provide necessary functions and macros for logging, error handling, and fuzzing operations. The code also checks for the `FD_HAS_HOSTED` macro to ensure it is running in a suitable environment. The primary purpose of this code is to validate the robustness and correctness of the `fd_compute_budget_program` by subjecting it to a variety of input scenarios, ensuring that it handles them without crashing and adheres to expected constraints.

# Functions

---
### LLVMFuzzerInitialize<!-- {{#callable:LLVMFuzzerInitialize}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/disco/pack/fuzz_compute_budget_program_parse.c#L13>)

Initializes the fuzzer environment by setting environment variables, booting the system, registering an exit function, and setting the log level.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: A pointer to the argument count, typically from the command line.
    - `argv`: A pointer to the argument vector, typically from the command line.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Set the environment variable `FD_LOG_BACKTRACE` to `0` to disable backtraces in logs.
    - Call `fd_boot` with `argc` and `argv` to initialize the system.
    - Register `fd_halt` to be called on program exit using `atexit`.
    - Set the core log level to `3` using `fd_log_level_core_set`, which causes the program to crash on warning logs.
    - Return `0` to indicate successful initialization.
- **Output**: Returns `0` to indicate successful initialization.

### LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput<!-- {{#callable:LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/disco/pack/fuzz_compute_budget_program_parse.c#L24>)

Processes input data to validate and assert conditions on a compute budget program state.
- **Inputs**:
    - `data`: A pointer to an array of unsigned characters representing the input data.
    - `data_sz`: An unsigned long integer representing the size of the input data array.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Check if `data_sz` is greater than or equal to 16; if true, return -1.
    - Initialize a `fd_compute_budget_program_state_t` structure named `state` with zero values.
    - Call `fd_compute_budget_program_parse` with `data`, `data_sz`, and `state` to parse the input data into the state structure.
    - If parsing fails (indicated by `ok` being false), execute `FD_FUZZ_MUST_BE_COVERED` and return 0.
    - Execute `FD_FUZZ_MUST_BE_COVERED` again after parsing.
    - Assert that `state->compute_budget_instr_cnt` is greater than 0.
    - Assert that `state->compute_units` is less than or equal to `FD_COMPUTE_BUDGET_MAX_CU_LIMIT`.
    - Assert that `state->heap_size` is a multiple of `FD_COMPUTE_BUDGET_HEAP_FRAME_GRANULARITY`.
    - Return 0 after all assertions.
- **Output**: Returns -1 if `data_sz` is 16 or more; otherwise, returns 0 after processing and assertions.
