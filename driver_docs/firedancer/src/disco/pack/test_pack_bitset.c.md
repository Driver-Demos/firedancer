Tests for the functionality of packed bitsets, including set, clear, copy, and intersection operations.

# Purpose
The code is a C program that tests the functionality of a bitset implementation. It includes the header files `fd_ballet_base.h` and `fd_pack_bitset.h`, which likely define the necessary macros and functions for bitset operations. The program initializes the environment using `fd_boot`, logs the current bitset mode, and then performs a series of tests on bitset operations such as setting, clearing, and checking bits. The main operations tested include `FD_PACK_BITSET_SETN`, `FD_PACK_BITSET_CLEARN`, `FD_PACK_BITSET_ISNULL`, `FD_PACK_BITSET_OR`, `FD_PACK_BITSET_COPY`, and `FD_PACK_BITSET_INTERSECT4_EMPTY`.

The program declares multiple bitsets (`x`, `y`, `z`, and `w`) and performs operations to verify their behavior. It tests setting and clearing individual bits, as well as more complex operations like bitwise OR and intersection checks. The tests ensure that the bitsets behave as expected, including handling out-of-bounds operations as no-ops. The program uses `FD_TEST` to assert the correctness of each operation, and it logs a notice when all tests pass. Finally, it calls `fd_halt` to clean up before exiting. This code serves as a test suite to validate the correctness and reliability of the bitset implementation.

[View Source →](<../../../../../src/disco/pack/test_pack_bitset.c#L4>)

Tests various operations on packed bitsets, including setting, clearing, copying, and checking for intersections.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments.
    - `argv`: An array of command-line argument strings.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Calls `fd_boot` to initialize the environment with command-line arguments.
    - Logs the current bitset mode using `FD_LOG_NOTICE`.
    - Declares and clears a bitset `x`, then tests setting and clearing each bit within the range of `FD_PACK_BITSET_MAX`.
    - Attempts to set out-of-bounds bits and verifies that these operations do not affect the bitset state.
    - Declares and clears another bitset `y`, then performs bitwise OR operations with `x` and tests the results.
    - Copies bitset `y` to `x` and tests clearing operations to ensure `x` becomes null.
    - Declares additional bitsets `z` and `w`, tests intersection operations among four bitsets, and verifies the results.
    - Logs a success message and calls `fd_halt` to terminate the program.
- **Output**: Returns 0 to indicate successful execution.
