Defines security policies for logging, metrics, and CPU usage management in a tile environment.

# Purpose
The configuration file defines logging and metrics operations for a software system. It specifies that log messages are written to a file or pipe, with messages of 'WARNING' level and above also sent to STDERR. The file descriptor for logging is identified by `logfile_fd`, and the system ensures that STDERR is always descriptor 2. The configuration also includes conditions for synchronizing the log file to disk immediately for 'WARNING' level messages and above. Additionally, it outlines how to retrieve metrics, such as the number of context switches, by reading from `/proc/status` file descriptors, excluding those for the log file and STDOUT. The file also includes a condition to reduce CPU usage by sleeping, using `clock_nanosleep` with specific arguments.
