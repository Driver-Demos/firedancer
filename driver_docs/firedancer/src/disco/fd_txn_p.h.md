Defines structures and macros for handling transactions with attributes for execution and account data.

# Purpose
The code defines a C header file that provides data structures and macros for handling transactions in a system. The primary structure, `fd_txn_p`, is designed to store transaction data, including payload, size, and various computational units (CUs) related to transaction execution and accounting. The structure uses a union to manage different sets of CUs, which are populated by different components of the system, such as `pack` and `bank`. The structure also includes fields for tracking the transaction's arrival time, source information, and flags that indicate transaction status and results.

Additionally, the code defines another structure, `fd_txn_e`, which extends `fd_txn_p` by including an array for expanded address lookup tables, allowing for more detailed account management. The macro `TXN` is provided to facilitate access to the transaction data within the `fd_txn_p` structure. This header file is intended to be included in other parts of the system, providing a standardized way to manage and process transaction data across different modules.

# Data Structures

---
### fd\_txn\_p
- **Type**: ``struct fd_txn_p``
- **Members**:
    - ``payload``: An array of unsigned characters with a size defined by `FD_TPU_MTU`.
    - ``payload_sz``: An unsigned long integer representing the size of the payload.
    - ``pack_cu``: A struct containing `non_execution_cus` and `requested_exec_plus_acct_data_cus` for pack operations.
    - ``bank_cu``: A struct containing `rebated_cus` and `actual_consumed_cus` for bank operations.
    - ``blockhash_slot``: An unsigned long integer representing the slot provided by the resolv tile.
    - ``scheduler_arrival_time_nanos``: A long integer representing the time the transaction arrived at the pack tile in nanoseconds.
    - ``source_tpu``: An unsigned character representing the source TPU.
    - ``source_ipv4``: An unsigned integer representing the source IPv4 address.
    - ``flags``: An unsigned integer representing a combination of bitfields and transaction result code.
    - ``_``: An array of unsigned characters with a size defined by `FD_TXN_MAX_SZ`, aligned to `fd_txn_t`.
- **Description**: Represents a transaction structure aligned to 64 bytes, containing payload data, execution and account data usage metrics, source information, and flags for transaction processing. It includes a union for different execution contexts and a flexible array for transaction data access.

### fd\_txn\_p\_t
- **Type**: ``struct fd_txn_p``
- **Members**:
    - ``payload``: An array of unsigned characters with a size defined by `FD_TPU_MTU`.
    - ``payload_sz``: An unsigned long integer representing the size of the payload.
    - ``pack_cu``: A struct containing `non_execution_cus` and `requested_exec_plus_acct_data_cus` for pack operations.
    - ``bank_cu``: A struct containing `rebated_cus` and `actual_consumed_cus` for bank operations.
    - ``blockhash_slot``: An unsigned long integer used when the transaction is in extra storage in pack.
    - ``scheduler_arrival_time_nanos``: A long integer representing the time the transaction arrived at the pack tile in nanoseconds.
    - ``source_tpu``: An unsigned character indicating the source TPU pipeline for the transaction.
    - ``source_ipv4``: An unsigned integer representing the source IPv4 address.
    - ``flags``: An unsigned integer populated by pack and bank, combining bitfields and transaction result code.
    - ``_``: An array of unsigned characters aligned to `fd_txn_t`, accessed with the `TXN` macro.
- **Description**: `fd_txn_p_t` is a structure aligned to 64 bytes that represents a transaction with various attributes such as payload, size, and source information. It includes a union for handling different computational units (`pack_cu` and `bank_cu`) and a blockhash slot for extra storage. The structure also records the transaction's arrival time and source details, and it uses a flexible array member for transaction data, accessed via a macro.


---
### fd\_txn\_e
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - ``txnp``: An array of one `fd_txn_p_t` element, representing a transaction payload.
    - ``alt_accts``: An array of alternative account addresses with a maximum size defined by `FD_TXN_ACCT_ADDR_MAX`.
- **Description**: Aligns to 64 bytes and extends `fd_txn_p_t` by including an array of alternative account addresses, which are used in conjunction with the main account in `fd_txn_t`.


---
### fd\_txn\_e\_t
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - ``txnp``: An array of one `fd_txn_p_t` structure.
    - ``alt_accts``: An array of `fd_acct_addr_t` for expanded address lookup tables.
- **Description**: `fd_txn_e_t` is a structure that extends `fd_txn_p_t` by including an array for expanded address lookup tables, allowing for additional account address management beyond what is stored in the `fd_txn_t`.
