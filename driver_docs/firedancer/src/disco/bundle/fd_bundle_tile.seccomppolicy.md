Defines a seccomp policy for managing file descriptors and network operations in a bundle application.

# Purpose
This configuration file defines various file descriptors and system call behaviors for managing network connections, logging, and DNS resolution within a software application. It specifies file descriptors such as `logfile_fd` for logging messages, `keylog_fd` for logging HTTPS session keys, and others for DNS configuration files. The file outlines the use of system calls like `read`, `write`, `sendmsg`, and `recvmsg` to handle TCP and UDP connections, including specific conditions for non-blocking operations and error handling. It also includes configurations for socket options and behaviors, such as `setsockopt` for configuring TCP and UDP sockets, and `fcntl` for making TCP connections non-blocking. Additionally, it addresses the use of OpenSSL functions for randomness generation, which involves system calls like `getpid` and `getrandom`. The file is integral to the codebase as it provides detailed instructions for network communication and logging, ensuring the application operates correctly in handling network protocols and data logging.
# Content Summary
This configuration file outlines the handling of various file descriptors and network operations within a software system. It specifies the use of file descriptors for logging and DNS resolution, and details the operations for managing TCP and UDP connections, particularly in the context of HTTPS and DNS activities.

1. **File Descriptors**: 
   - `logfile_fd` is used for logging messages to a file, which can be disabled by configuration. 
   - `keylog_fd` is for logging HTTPS session keys, primarily for development purposes.
   - `etc_hosts_fd` and `etc_resolv_conf` are used for DNS record resolution.

2. **Network Operations**:
   - **Reading and Writing**: The system reads from TCP connections for HTTPS and HTTP (`read`), and writes log messages to files or pipes (`write`). It also writes HTTPS session keys using `writev`.
   - **Message Sending and Receiving**: DNS queries and responses are managed using `sendmsg`, `sendto`, and `recvmsg`, with specific flags to control message behavior.
   - **Socket Management**: The system establishes and manages TCP connections using `socket`, `connect`, and `shutdown`. It also closes connections with `close` and makes them non-blocking with `fcntl`.
   - **Configuration and Polling**: Socket options are configured using `setsockopt`, and the system waits for connections or DNS responses with `ppoll`.

3. **DNS and Logging**:
   - DNS configurations are read using `lseek`, and DNS queries are sent via UDP or TCP. The system binds DNS request sockets with `bind`.
   - Log messages of 'WARNING' level and above are immediately synchronized to disk using `fsync`.

4. **OpenSSL and Randomness**:
   - The system uses OpenSSL's `RAND_bytes` for generating randomness, which involves `getpid` and `getrandom` for process identification and random number generation.

5. **Miscellaneous**:
   - The system includes operations for yielding to the scheduler (`sched_yield`) and managing sleep intervals (`clock_nanosleep`) to optimize power usage.

This configuration file is crucial for developers to understand how the system handles logging, network communication, and DNS resolution, ensuring efficient and secure operations.
