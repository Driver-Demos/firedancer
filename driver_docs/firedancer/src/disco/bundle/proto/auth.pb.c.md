Nanopb constant definitions for authentication protocol buffer messages.

# Purpose
This code is a C source file that contains automatically generated constant definitions for Protocol Buffers (protobuf) using the nanopb library. It includes the header file `auth.pb.h`, which likely contains the protobuf message definitions related to authentication processes. The file uses the `PB_BIND` macro to bind various authentication-related protobuf message types, such as `auth_GenerateAuthChallengeRequest`, `auth_GenerateAuthChallengeResponse`, `auth_GenerateAuthTokensRequest`, `auth_Token`, `auth_GenerateAuthTokensResponse`, `auth_RefreshAccessTokenRequest`, and `auth_RefreshAccessTokenResponse`. These bindings facilitate the serialization and deserialization of these message types for communication between systems.

The file includes a version check for the protobuf header version, ensuring compatibility with the nanopb generator version used to create the file. If the version does not match, it triggers a compilation error, prompting the user to regenerate the file with the current version of the nanopb generator. This ensures that the generated code remains consistent with the expected protobuf definitions and the nanopb library's capabilities.
