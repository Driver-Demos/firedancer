Automatically generated nanopb constant definitions for `google_protobuf_Timestamp`.

# Purpose
This code is a C header file that contains automatically generated constant definitions for use with the nanopb library, version 0.4.9.1. It includes the header file `timestamp.pb.h`, which is likely related to Protocol Buffers (protobuf) definitions for a `google_protobuf_Timestamp` structure. The code checks if the `PB_PROTO_HEADER_VERSION` is equal to 40, and if not, it triggers a compilation error instructing the user to regenerate the file with the current version of the nanopb generator. The `PB_BIND` macro is used to bind the `google_protobuf_Timestamp` structure for automatic handling by nanopb.
