Defines protobuf messages and services for generating and refreshing authentication tokens.

# Purpose
The `proto3` syntax file defines the `AuthService`, which is responsible for issuing authentication tokens to clients for API access. It includes an enumeration `Role` that specifies different client roles such as `RELAYER`, `SEARCHER`, `VALIDATOR`, and `SHREDSTREAM_SUBSCRIBER`. The file defines several messages, including `GenerateAuthChallengeRequest` and `GenerateAuthChallengeResponse`, which handle the initial challenge-response mechanism for token generation. The `GenerateAuthTokensRequest` and `GenerateAuthTokensResponse` messages manage the issuance of access and refresh tokens, while the `RefreshAccessTokenRequest` and `RefreshAccessTokenResponse` messages facilitate the renewal of access tokens using a valid refresh token. The `AuthService` provides three remote procedure calls (RPCs): `GenerateAuthChallenge`, `GenerateAuthTokens`, and `RefreshAccessToken`, each corresponding to the defined messages to manage the authentication process.
