Defines the maximum length of the pubkey in BlockBuilderFeeInfoResponse as 44.

# Purpose
The metadata specifies that the `pubkey` field in the `BlockBuilderFeeInfoResponse` class of the `block_engine` module has a maximum length of 44 characters. This constraint ensures that any public key assigned to this field does not exceed the defined character limit.
