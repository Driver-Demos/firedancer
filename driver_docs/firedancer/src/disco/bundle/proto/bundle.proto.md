Defines protobuf messages for a bundle with a header, packets, and a UUID.

# Purpose
The code defines a Protocol Buffers (`proto3`) schema for a package named `bundle`. It imports definitions from `packet.proto` and `shared.proto` to use in its own message structures. The `Bundle` message includes a `header` field of type `shared.Header` and a `packets` field, which is a repeated list of `packet.Packet` messages. Additionally, the `BundleUuid` message contains a `bundle` field of type `bundle.Bundle` and a `uuid` field of type `bytes`. This code provides a narrow functionality focused on defining data structures for bundling packets with associated metadata and unique identifiers.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `packet.proto`
- `shared.proto`


# Data Structures

---
### Bundle
- **Type**: ``message``
- **Members**:
    - ``header``: A `shared.Header` object that contains metadata for the `Bundle`.
    - ``packets``: A list of `packet.Packet` objects that the `Bundle` contains.
- **Description**: Represents a collection of packets with a header, where `header` provides metadata and `packets` is a list of `packet.Packet` objects. The `Bundle` is part of the `bundle` package and is defined using Protocol Buffers syntax.


---
### BundleUuid
- **Type**: ``message``
- **Members**:
    - ``bundle``: A `Bundle` message that contains a header and repeated packets.
    - ``uuid``: A byte array that represents a universally unique identifier (UUID).
- **Description**: The `BundleUuid` message is a data structure that contains a `Bundle` and a `uuid`. The `Bundle` includes a header and a list of packets, while the `uuid` is a byte array that uniquely identifies the `BundleUuid` instance.
