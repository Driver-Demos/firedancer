Nanopb-generated header file defining protocol buffer message structures and encoding specifications for block engine operations.

# Purpose
The code is a C header file generated by the nanopb library, version 0.4.9.1. It defines data structures and associated metadata for Protocol Buffers (protobuf) messages used in a block engine system. The file includes several message types, such as `block_engine_SubscribePacketsRequest`, `block_engine_SubscribePacketsResponse`, `block_engine_SubscribeBundlesRequest`, `block_engine_SubscribeBundlesResponse`, `block_engine_BlockBuilderFeeInfoRequest`, and `block_engine_BlockBuilderFeeInfoResponse`. These structures are used to represent requests and responses for subscribing to packets and bundles, as well as for retrieving block builder fee information.

The header file includes necessary imports from other protobuf files, such as `packet.pb.h`, `shared.pb.h`, and `bundle.pb.h`, which define additional message types used within the structures. It also provides initializer macros for each message type, ensuring that the structures can be initialized with default or zero values. The file specifies field tags for manual encoding and decoding, and it includes field encoding specifications for nanopb. The header ensures compatibility with the nanopb library by checking the `PB_PROTO_HEADER_VERSION` and provides backward compatibility with code written before nanopb version 0.4.0.

# Data Structures

---
### block\_engine\_SubscribePacketsRequest
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `dummy_field`: A placeholder character field.
- **Description**: Defines a structure with a single character field named `dummy_field`, which serves as a placeholder and does not hold meaningful data.


---
### block\_engine\_SubscribePacketsResponse
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `has_header`: Indicates if the `header` field is present.
    - `header`: Stores a `shared_Header` structure.
    - `has_batch`: Indicates if the `batch` field is present.
    - `batch`: Stores a `packet_PacketBatch` structure.
- **Description**: The `block_engine_SubscribePacketsResponse` structure is used to represent a response that may include a header and a batch of packets. The presence of these fields is indicated by the `has_header` and `has_batch` boolean flags, respectively. This structure is part of a protocol buffer definition generated by nanopb, which is a small code-size Protocol Buffers implementation in C.


---
### block\_engine\_SubscribeBundlesRequest
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `dummy_field`: A placeholder character field.
- **Description**: The `block_engine_SubscribeBundlesRequest` struct is a data structure with a single member, `dummy_field`, which serves as a placeholder. This struct is part of a larger system generated by nanopb, a protocol buffer library, and is likely used as a request message in a communication protocol, although it currently does not contain meaningful data fields.


---
### block\_engine\_SubscribeBundlesResponse
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `bundles`: A callback field for repeated message handling.
- **Description**: The `block_engine_SubscribeBundlesResponse` structure is part of a protocol buffer implementation using nanopb. It contains a single member, `bundles`, which is a callback type used to handle repeated messages, specifically for managing bundles in the context of the block engine.


---
### block\_engine\_BlockBuilderFeeInfoRequest
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - ``dummy_field``: A placeholder field of type `char`.
- **Description**: Contains a single `char` field named `dummy_field`, which serves as a placeholder or filler in the structure. This structure is likely used as a part of a protocol buffer message definition, but currently does not hold any meaningful data.


---
### block\_engine\_BlockBuilderFeeInfoResponse
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `pubkey`: A character array of size 45 that stores a public key.
    - `commission`: A 64-bit unsigned integer that represents the commission percentage (0-100).
- **Description**: Stores information about a block builder's fee, including a public key and a commission percentage.
