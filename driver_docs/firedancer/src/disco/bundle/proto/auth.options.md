Defines maximum sizes for authentication-related request and token fields.

# Purpose
The file defines the maximum size constraints for various fields in authentication-related requests and responses. The `auth.GenerateAuthChallengeRequest.pubkey` field has a maximum size of 32 bytes. The `auth.GenerateAuthChallengeResponse.challenge` field is limited to 9 bytes. The `auth.GenerateAuthTokensRequest` includes three fields: `challenge` with a maximum size of 55 bytes, `client_pubkey` with a maximum size of 32 bytes, and `signed_challenge` with a maximum size of 64 bytes. The `auth.RefreshAccessTokenRequest.refresh_token` and `auth.Token.value` fields both have a maximum size of 1024 bytes. These constraints ensure that the data transmitted in these fields does not exceed the specified byte limits.
