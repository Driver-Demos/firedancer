Defines gRPC services for validators to subscribe to packet and bundle streams and retrieve fee info.

# Purpose
The file defines a Protocol Buffers (`proto3`) schema for a service named `BlockEngineValidator` within the `block_engine` package. It specifies messages and remote procedure calls (RPCs) that facilitate communication between validators and block engines. The `SubscribePacketsRequest` and `SubscribePacketsResponse` messages enable validators to subscribe to a stream of packets, while the `SubscribeBundlesRequest` and `SubscribeBundlesResponse` messages allow subscription to a stream of simulated and profitable bundles. Additionally, the `BlockBuilderFeeInfoRequest` and `BlockBuilderFeeInfoResponse` messages provide a mechanism for block builders to retrieve fee information, including a public key and commission rate. The service includes three RPC methods: `SubscribePackets`, `SubscribeBundles`, and `GetBlockBuilderFeeInfo`, each designed to handle specific interactions between validators and the block engine.
