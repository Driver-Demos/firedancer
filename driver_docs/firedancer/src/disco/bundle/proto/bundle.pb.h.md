Nanopb-generated header for defining and initializing `bundle_Bundle` and `bundle_BundleUuid` structures.

# Purpose
This code is a C header file generated by the nanopb library, version 0.4.9.1, for Protocol Buffers (protobuf) serialization. It defines data structures and associated metadata for two protobuf message types: `bundle_Bundle` and `bundle_BundleUuid`. The `bundle_Bundle` structure includes a boolean `has_header`, a `shared_Header` type `header`, and a callback for `packets`. The `bundle_BundleUuid` structure contains a boolean `has_bundle`, a `bundle_Bundle` type `bundle`, and a `bundle_BundleUuid_uuid_t` type `uuid`. The file includes macros for initializing these structures with default and zero values, field tags for encoding/decoding, and field lists for nanopb's encoding specifications. It also ensures compatibility with previous nanopb versions and includes necessary external references for message descriptions.

- `packet.pb.h`
- `shared.pb.h`


# Data Structures

---
### bundle\_Bundle
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `has_header`: Indicates if the `header` field is present.
    - `header`: Stores a `shared_Header` structure.
    - `packets`: Holds a `pb_callback_t` for repeated packet messages.
- **Description**: Represents a data structure that contains a header and a collection of packets, with a boolean flag to indicate the presence of the header. The `header` is a `shared_Header` type, and `packets` is a callback type used for handling repeated packet messages.


---
### bundle\_BundleUuid
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `has_bundle`: Indicates if the `bundle` field is present.
    - `bundle`: Contains a `bundle_Bundle` structure.
    - `uuid`: Stores a UUID as a byte array with a maximum size of 128 bytes.
- **Description**: Encapsulates a bundle and its associated UUID, with a flag to indicate the presence of the bundle.
