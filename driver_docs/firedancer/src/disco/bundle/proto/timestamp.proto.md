Defines a protobuf message for a timestamp with seconds and nanoseconds fields.

# Purpose
The `proto3` syntax defines a protocol buffer message named `Timestamp` within the `google.protobuf` package. This message contains two fields: `seconds`, which is a 64-bit integer representing the number of seconds since the Unix epoch, and `nanos`, which is a 32-bit integer representing the fractional seconds in nanoseconds. This structure is used to represent precise time points.
