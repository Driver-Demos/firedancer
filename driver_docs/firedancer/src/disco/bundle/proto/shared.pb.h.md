Defines nanopb-generated structures and encoding specifications for shared message types like Header, Heartbeat, and Socket.

# Purpose
This code is a C header file generated by the nanopb library, version 0.4.9.1, which is used for encoding and decoding Protocol Buffers (protobuf) in C. The file defines data structures and associated metadata for three protobuf messages: `shared_Header`, `shared_Heartbeat`, and `shared_Socket`. These structures are used to represent serialized data in a compact binary format, suitable for communication between systems or storage.

The `shared_Header` structure includes a boolean field `has_ts` and a `google_protobuf_Timestamp` field `ts`, indicating the presence and value of a timestamp. The `shared_Heartbeat` structure contains a single field, `count`, which is a 64-bit unsigned integer. The `shared_Socket` structure includes an IP address represented as a byte array (`shared_Socket_ip_t`) and a 64-bit integer `port`. The file also provides default and zero-initializer macros for these structures, field tags for manual encoding/decoding, and message descriptors for use with nanopb's encoding and decoding functions. The header ensures compatibility with the nanopb version used to generate it and includes conditional compilation to enforce this.

# Data Structures

---
### shared\_Header
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `has_ts`: Indicates if the `ts` field contains a valid timestamp.
    - `ts`: Stores a timestamp using the `google_protobuf_Timestamp` type.
- **Description**: Represents a header structure that includes a timestamp field and a boolean flag to indicate the presence of a valid timestamp.


---
### shared\_Heartbeat
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - ``count``: A 64-bit unsigned integer that stores the heartbeat count.
- **Description**: The `shared_Heartbeat` struct is a simple data structure that contains a single member, `count`, which is used to store a 64-bit unsigned integer representing the heartbeat count. This struct is part of a larger system that likely uses the heartbeat count for monitoring or synchronization purposes.


---
### shared\_Socket
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - ``ip``: A byte array representing the IP address as a string.
    - ``port``: An integer representing the port number.
- **Description**: Defines a network socket with an IP address and a port number, where the IP address is stored as a byte array and the port is a 64-bit integer.
