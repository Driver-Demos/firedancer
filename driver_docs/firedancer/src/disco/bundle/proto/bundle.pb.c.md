Automatically generated nanopb constant definitions for bundle_Bundle and bundle_BundleUuid.

# Purpose
This code is an automatically generated C source file containing constant definitions for Protocol Buffers using the nanopb library. It includes the header file `bundle.pb.h`, which is expected to define the structures and functions related to Protocol Buffers for a bundle. The code checks if the `PB_PROTO_HEADER_VERSION` is equal to 40, and if not, it triggers a compilation error instructing the user to regenerate the file with the current version of the nanopb generator. The `PB_BIND` macro is used to bind the Protocol Buffer message types `bundle_Bundle` and `bundle_BundleUuid` with their respective structures, using the `AUTO` option to automatically handle field encoding and decoding.
