Automatically generated nanopb constant definitions for packet-related structures.

# Purpose
This code is an automatically generated C source file for defining protocol buffer constants using the nanopb library. It includes the header file `packet.pb.h` and checks if the `PB_PROTO_HEADER_VERSION` is 40, issuing an error if not, to ensure compatibility with the nanopb generator version used. The file uses the `PB_BIND` macro to bind protocol buffer message types such as `packet_PacketBatch`, `packet_Packet`, `packet_Meta`, and `packet_PacketFlags` to their respective structures, with some bindings using the `AUTO` option and others specifying a version number of 2. This setup facilitates the serialization and deserialization of protocol buffer messages in C applications.
