Automatically generated nanopb constant definitions for shared_Header, shared_Heartbeat, and shared_Socket.

# Purpose
This code is a C source file that contains automatically generated constant definitions for Protocol Buffers using the nanopb library, version 0.4.9.1. It includes the header file `shared.pb.h` and checks if the `PB_PROTO_HEADER_VERSION` is 40, issuing an error if it is not, to ensure compatibility with the current nanopb generator version. The file uses the `PB_BIND` macro to bind Protocol Buffer message types `shared_Header`, `shared_Heartbeat`, and `shared_Socket` with automatic field handling. This setup facilitates the serialization and deserialization of these message types in a C environment.
