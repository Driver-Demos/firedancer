Nanopb-generated header file defining structures and encoding specifications for packet data.

# Purpose
The code is a C header file generated by the nanopb library, which is a small code generator and runtime library for encoding and decoding Protocol Buffers data. This file defines data structures and associated metadata for handling packets in a networked environment. The primary structures defined are `packet_PacketBatch`, `packet_Packet`, `packet_Meta`, and `packet_PacketFlags`. These structures are used to represent batches of packets, individual packets, metadata associated with packets, and flags indicating the status or properties of packets, respectively.

The file includes initializers for these structures, field tags for encoding and decoding, and field lists that specify the data types and properties of each field within the structures. The header also contains compatibility definitions for older versions of nanopb and specifies maximum encoded sizes for the messages. The inclusion of `extern "C"` indicates that the file is compatible with C++ compilers, allowing the defined structures and functions to be used in C++ projects. The file is intended to be included in other C source files that require the defined data structures and nanopb encoding/decoding functionality.

# Data Structures

---
### packet\_PacketBatch
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `packets`: A callback field of type `pb_callback_t` for handling repeated message packets.
- **Description**: Represents a batch of packets using a callback mechanism to handle repeated packet messages. The `packet_PacketBatch` structure is part of a nanopb-generated codebase, which is used for encoding and decoding Protocol Buffers in C. The `packets` member is a callback that facilitates the processing of multiple packet messages within the batch.


---
### packet\_PacketFlags
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `discard`: Indicates if the packet should be discarded.
    - `forwarded`: Indicates if the packet has been forwarded.
    - `repair`: Indicates if the packet requires repair.
    - `simple_vote_tx`: Indicates if the packet is a simple vote transaction.
    - `tracer_packet`: Indicates if the packet is a tracer packet.
    - `from_staked_node`: Indicates if the packet originates from a staked node.
- **Description**: `packet_PacketFlags` is a structure that contains boolean flags to represent various states or attributes of a packet, such as whether it should be discarded, has been forwarded, requires repair, is a simple vote transaction, is a tracer packet, or originates from a staked node.


---
### packet\_Meta
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - ``size``: Specifies the size of the packet.
    - ``addr``: Stores the address as a string with a maximum length of 256 characters.
    - ``port``: Indicates the port number associated with the packet.
    - ``has_flags``: Indicates if the packet has associated flags.
    - ``flags``: Holds the flags of type `packet_PacketFlags` that provide additional packet information.
    - ``sender_stake``: Represents the stake of the sender in the packet.
- **Description**: Contains metadata for a packet, including its size, address, port, flags, and sender's stake. The `flags` field is of type `packet_PacketFlags`, which provides additional information about the packet's status and origin.


---
### packet\_Packet
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `data`: Contains the packet data as a byte array with a maximum size of 2048 bytes.
    - `has_meta`: Indicates if the packet has associated metadata.
    - `meta`: Holds metadata information about the packet, including size, address, port, flags, and sender stake.
- **Description**: Represents a packet structure that includes the packet data and optional metadata. The `data` field stores the actual packet content, while the `meta` field provides additional information about the packet, such as its size, address, and other attributes. The `has_meta` boolean indicates whether the `meta` field contains valid metadata.
