Defines protocol buffer structures and enums for authentication challenges and token generation using nanopb.

# Purpose
The code is a C header file generated by the nanopb library, which is used for encoding and decoding Protocol Buffers (protobuf) in C. This file defines data structures and constants for an authentication protocol. It includes definitions for several message types related to authentication, such as `auth_GenerateAuthChallengeRequest`, `auth_GenerateAuthChallengeResponse`, `auth_GenerateAuthTokensRequest`, `auth_GenerateAuthTokensResponse`, `auth_RefreshAccessTokenRequest`, and `auth_RefreshAccessTokenResponse`. These structures are used to handle requests and responses for generating authentication challenges, tokens, and refreshing access tokens.

The file also defines an enumeration `auth_Role` to specify different roles a client can assume, such as `RELAYER`, `SEARCHER`, `VALIDATOR`, and `SHREDSTREAM_SUBSCRIBER`. Each message structure is associated with specific fields, such as public keys, challenges, and tokens, which are represented as byte arrays. The file includes macros for initializing these structures and specifies field tags for manual encoding and decoding. Additionally, it provides message descriptors for use with nanopb's encoding and decoding functions. The header ensures compatibility with a specific version of the nanopb generator and includes checks to enforce this.

# Data Structures

---
### auth\_Role
- **Type**: ``enum``
- **Members**:
    - ``auth_Role_RELAYER``: Represents the role of a relayer with a value of 0.
    - ``auth_Role_SEARCHER``: Represents the role of a searcher with a value of 1.
    - ``auth_Role_VALIDATOR``: Represents the role of a validator with a value of 2.
    - ``auth_Role_SHREDSTREAM_SUBSCRIBER``: Represents the role of a shredstream subscriber with a value of 3.
- **Description**: Defines different roles within an authentication system, each represented by a unique integer value.


---
### auth\_GenerateAuthChallengeRequest
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `role`: Specifies the role for which the client wants to generate tokens.
    - `pubkey`: Holds the client's 32-byte public key.
- **Description**: Defines a request structure for generating an authentication challenge, containing the client's role and public key.


---
### auth\_GenerateAuthChallengeResponse
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `challenge`: A byte array representing a challenge string.
- **Description**: Encapsulates a challenge string used in the authentication process, represented as a byte array of fixed size.


---
### auth\_GenerateAuthTokensRequest
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `challenge`: The pre-signed challenge as a byte array.
    - `client_pubkey`: The 32-byte public key corresponding to the signing keypair.
    - `signed_challenge`: The 64-byte signature of the challenge signed by the client's private key.
- **Description**: Facilitates the generation of authentication tokens by holding the necessary cryptographic elements, including a pre-signed challenge, a client's public key, and a signed challenge.


---
### auth\_Token
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - ``value``: Contains the token as a string.
    - ``has_expires_at_utc``: Indicates if the token has an expiration time.
    - ``expires_at_utc``: Stores the expiration time of the token as a `google_protobuf_Timestamp`.
- **Description**: Represents an authentication token with a value and optional expiration time. The `value` field holds the token itself, while `has_expires_at_utc` is a boolean flag indicating whether the `expires_at_utc` field is set, which specifies when the token will expire.


---
### auth\_GenerateAuthTokensResponse
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `has_access_token`: Indicates if the `access_token` is present.
    - `access_token`: Holds the token that grants access to resources.
    - `has_refresh_token`: Indicates if the `refresh_token` is present.
    - `refresh_token`: Holds the token used to refresh the `access_token`.
- **Description**: Manages the response for generating authentication tokens, including both access and refresh tokens, with flags indicating their presence.


---
### auth\_RefreshAccessTokenRequest
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `refresh_token`: Non-expired refresh token obtained from the `GenerateAuthTokens` method.
- **Description**: Holds a non-expired refresh token used to request a new access token. The `refresh_token` is a string that must be obtained from the `GenerateAuthTokens` method and is used to maintain access without re-authentication.


---
### auth\_RefreshAccessTokenResponse
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `has_access_token`: Indicates if the `access_token` is present.
    - `access_token`: Holds the fresh access token of type `auth_Token`.
- **Description**: Manages the response for refreshing an access token, containing a boolean to indicate the presence of a new access token and the token itself.
