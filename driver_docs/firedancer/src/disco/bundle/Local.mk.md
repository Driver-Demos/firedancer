Makefile for adding headers, objects, and unit tests for the `firedancer` codebase components.

# Purpose
The content is a Makefile script that manages the build process for a software project. It uses conditional statements to check for the presence of certain features, such as `FD_HAS_INT128`, `FD_HAS_HOSTED`, and `FD_HAS_DOUBLE`, to determine which headers and object files to include in the build. The script defines targets for unit tests and fuzz tests, such as `test_bundle_crank` and `fuzz_bundle_client`, and specifies dependencies for these tests. It also includes calls to execute these tests, ensuring that the software components are verified during the build process. The use of `$(OPENSSL_LIBS)` indicates that some tests require OpenSSL libraries, which are included when the `FD_HAS_HOSTED` condition is met.
