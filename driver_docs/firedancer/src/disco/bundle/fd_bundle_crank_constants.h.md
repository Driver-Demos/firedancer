Defines constants for the keyguard tile in the Firedancer codebase to minimize its attack surface.

# Purpose
This code is a C header file that defines several constants using the `#define` preprocessor directive. These constants are related to the configuration of a "keyguard tile," which is likely a component of a larger system. The file includes size definitions (`FD_BUNDLE_CRANK_2_SZ`, `FD_BUNDLE_CRANK_3_SZ`) and offset definitions (`FD_BUNDLE_CRANK_2_IX1_DISC_OFF`, etc.) for different crank bundles, as well as byte sequences for initialization and change operations (`FD_BUNDLE_CRANK_DISC_INIT_TIP_DISTR`, etc.). The file does not include an include guard, as it only contains `#define` statements, which aligns with the goal of minimizing the attack surface of the keyguard tile.
