Feature checklist for the rewrite of the "bundle" tile, comparing versions 1.0 and 2.0.

# Purpose
The document outlines the features of the "bundle" tile, comparing the capabilities of version 1.0 with the planned features for version 2.0. It lists the features supported by the old bundle tile, such as packet delivery, gRPC over HTTP/2 connections with and without TLS, and seccomp sandboxing. The document also specifies the features intended for the new bundle tile, including TCP performance metrics and SSL key log file support. Additionally, it identifies features that are uncertain for inclusion, such as power saving through yielding to the OS scheduler when I/O is inactive. This checklist helps track the development progress and feature parity between the two versions.
