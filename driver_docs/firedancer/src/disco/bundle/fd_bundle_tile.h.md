Provides a bundle client tile using HTTP/2 over TLS with TCP sockets and OpenSSL for I/O and security.

# Purpose
The `fd_bundle_tile.h` file is a C header file that defines a bundle client tile for network communication. It specifies the use of HTTP/2 over TLS connections, utilizing TCP sockets and OpenSSL for secure socket I/O, including handshake and record layers. The file includes the `fd_topo.h` header, indicating a dependency on the topology-related functionalities. It declares a structure `fd_bundle_tile` and its corresponding typedef `fd_bundle_tile_t`, as well as an external variable `fd_tile_bundle` of type `fd_topo_run_tile_t`. The header is part of a system that uses Firedancer's `fd_h2` and `fd_grpc` for handling HTTP/2 and gRPC logic, and it operates with busy polling, which does not include power-saving features.
# Imports and Dependencies

### fd\_bundle\_tile\_t
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - ``fd_bundle_tile``: A forward declaration of the `fd_bundle_tile` structure.
- **Description**: The `fd_bundle_tile_t` is a typedef for the `fd_bundle_tile` structure, which is forward declared in the provided code. This structure is part of a system that requires HTTP/2 over TLS connections, uses TCP sockets, and employs OpenSSL for socket I/O and security layers. It integrates with Firedancer's `fd_h2` and `fd_grpc` for HTTP/2 and gRPC logic, and operates with busy polling, indicating no power-saving features.
