Makefile for adding headers and object files related to the archiver in the firedancer project.

# Purpose
The `Makefile` snippet conditionally includes headers and object files based on the presence of the `FD_HAS_ALLOCA` macro. If `FD_HAS_ALLOCA` is defined, it adds the header file `fd_archiver.h` and the object files `fd_archiver_feeder`, `fd_archiver_writer`, and `fd_archiver_playback` to the build process, associating them with `fd_disco`. This setup is used to manage dependencies and compile the necessary components when the `alloca` function is available.
