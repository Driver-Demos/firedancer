Defines seccomp policy for logging and file operations in the archiver playback process.

# Purpose
The configuration file defines the behavior of logging and archiving processes in the software. It specifies that log messages are written to a designated log file and/or a pipe, with messages of 'WARNING' level and above also directed to the standard error (STDERR) pipe. The file descriptor for logging is identified as `logfile_fd`, and the archiving process reads from a file identified by `archive_fd`. The configuration ensures that all log messages are written to the log file, while 'WARNING' and higher severity messages are immediately synchronized to disk using `fsync` on the `logfile_fd`. Additionally, the archiving process reads data from the file associated with `archive_fd`.
