Seccomp filter policies, security policies, archiver tile implementations, and a Makefile for fd_archiver.

## Folders
- **[generated](generated/README.md)**: Seccomp filter policies for syscall restrictions in archiver feeder, playback, and writer components.

## Files
- **[archiver_feeder.seccomppolicy](archiver_feeder.seccomppolicy.md)**: Defines security policies for logging behavior, including file descriptor management and log synchronization.
- **[archiver_playback.seccomppolicy](archiver_playback.seccomppolicy.md)**: Defines seccomp policy for logging and file operations in the archiver playback process.
- **[archiver_writer.seccomppolicy](archiver_writer.seccomppolicy.md)**: Defines security policies for logging and file writing in the archiver writer component.
- **[fd_archiver.h](fd_archiver.h.md)**: Defines constants, macros, and a structure for managing fragment headers in the Firedancer archiver.
- **[fd_archiver_feeder.c](fd_archiver_feeder.c.md)**: Implements an archiver feeder tile system for capturing and forwarding data fragments to a writer tile.
- **[fd_archiver_playback.c](fd_archiver_playback.c.md)**: Implements an archiver playback tile that reads from an archive file, adds delay, and forwards data to receiver tiles.
- **[fd_archiver_writer.c](fd_archiver_writer.c.md)**: Implements an archiver writer tile that timestamps and writes input fragments to an archive tile.
- **[Local.mk](Local.mk.md)**: Makefile for adding headers and object files related to the archiver in the firedancer project.
