Defines security policies for logging and file writing in the archiver writer component.

# Purpose
The configuration file defines the logging behavior for a software system. It specifies that log messages are written to a file and/or a pipe, with messages of 'WARNING' level and above also being directed to the `STDERR` pipe. The file descriptors `logfile_fd` and `archive_fd` are used to identify the log file and archive file, respectively. The `write` operation checks if the file descriptor is either `STDERR`, `archive_fd`, or `logfile_fd` to determine where to write the log messages. Additionally, the `fsync` operation ensures that log messages of 'WARNING' level and above are immediately synchronized to disk when written to the log file, using the `logfile_fd` descriptor.
