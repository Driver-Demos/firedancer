Defines constants, macros, and a structure for managing fragment headers in the Firedancer archiver.

# Purpose
This code is a C header file that defines constants, macros, and a data structure for an archiving system. It includes a header guard to prevent multiple inclusions and imports another header file, `tiles.h`. The file defines several macros for marking and identifying fragment signatures, such as `FD_ARCHIVER_SIG_MARK_SHRED` and `FD_ARCHIVER_SIG_MARK_REPAIR`, which manipulate the 63rd bit of a signature to distinguish between different types of input fragments. The `fd_archiver_frag_header` structure is defined to represent the header of each fragment written to the archive, containing fields such as `magic`, `version`, `tile_id`, `ns_since_prev_fragment`, `sz`, `sig`, and `seq`. These fields store metadata about each fragment, including its origin, size, and sequence information. The file also defines constants for the header's version, tile identifiers, and alignment requirements.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `../tiles.h`


# Data Structures

---
### fd\_archiver\_frag\_header
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `magic`: A unique identifier for the fragment header.
    - `version`: Indicates the version of the fragment header.
    - `tile_id`: Identifies the tile from which the fragment was received.
    - `ns_since_prev_fragment`: Specifies the number of nanoseconds since the previous fragment.
    - `sz`: Denotes the size of the fragment data portion following this header.
    - `sig`: Holds the signature of the fragment.
    - `seq`: Represents the sequence number of the fragment.
- **Description**: Aligns to 1 byte and serves as a header for fragments written to an archive, containing metadata such as version, tile identifier, timing, size, signature, and sequence information.


---
### fd\_archiver\_frag\_header\_t
- **Type**: ``struct fd_archiver_frag_header``
- **Members**:
    - `magic`: A magic number used to identify the header as a Firedance Archiver header.
    - `version`: The version number of the header format.
    - `tile_id`: The identifier of the tile from which the fragment was received.
    - `ns_since_prev_fragment`: The number of nanoseconds since the previous fragment was received.
    - `sz`: The size of the fragment data portion that follows this header.
    - `sig`: The signature of the fragment.
    - `seq`: The sequence number of the fragment.
- **Description**: Defines the header structure for each fragment written to the archive, containing metadata such as version, tile identifier, timing information, data size, signature, and sequence number.
