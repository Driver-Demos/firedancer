Header file for partitioning blocks into batches of microblocks and fixed-size FEC sets with data and parity shreds.

# Purpose
The code is a C header file that defines constants and performs static assertions related to the partitioning of data blocks into batches of microblocks for Forward Error Correction (FEC) processing. It is part of a system that handles data shreds, which are divided into fixed-size FEC sets consisting of 32 data shreds and 32 parity shreds. The file specifies the parameters for managing these batches, such as the number of FEC sets per batch, the watermark levels for batch processing, and the buffer sizes required to accommodate different types of FEC sets (normal, chained, and resigned).

The header file includes definitions for constants like `FD_SHRED_BATCH_FEC_SETS_WMARK`, `FD_SHRED_BATCH_FEC_SETS_MAX`, and `FD_SHRED_BATCH_RAW_BUF_SZ`, which are used to control the size and structure of the batches. It also contains static assertions to ensure that the defined sizes and capacities meet the necessary requirements, such as supporting a minimum payload size (`FD_POH_SHRED_MTU`). The file is intended to be included in other C source files that implement the logic for processing and managing data shreds, ensuring that the batch processing adheres to the defined constraints and limits.
