Defines a seccomp filter policy for syscall handling in different architectures.

# Purpose
The code is a C header file that defines a seccomp (secure computing mode) filter policy for a specific application. It is automatically generated and should not be edited manually. The file includes necessary headers for seccomp and BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter) operations, and it defines architecture-specific constants to ensure compatibility with the runtime environment. The code is designed to work with different architectures, such as `i386`, `x86_64`, and `aarch64`, and it will produce an error if the target architecture is unsupported.

The main functionality of the code is encapsulated in the [`populate_sock_filter_policy_fd_shred_tile`](<#populate_sock_filter_policy_fd_shred_tile>) function. This function initializes a BPF filter array that enforces a security policy by allowing or denying specific system calls based on predefined conditions. The filter checks the architecture and system call numbers, allowing only `write` and `fsync` system calls under certain conditions. If the conditions are not met, the process is terminated using `SECCOMP_RET_KILL_PROCESS`. The function uses `fd_memcpy` to copy the filter configuration to the output buffer. This header file is intended to be included in other C source files where seccomp filtering is required to enhance security by restricting the system calls that a process can make.

# Global Variables

---
### sock\_filter\_policy\_fd\_shred\_tile\_instr\_cnt
- **Type**: ``unsigned int``
- **Description**: A constant unsigned integer that represents the number of instructions in a socket filter policy for a specific seccomp configuration.
- **Use**: Used to define the size of the `filter` array in the `populate_sock_filter_policy_fd_shred_tile` function.

[View Source →](<../../../../../../src/disco/shred/generated/fd_shred_tile_seccomp.h#L26>)

Populates a `sock_filter` array with a seccomp filter policy to control process execution based on system call checks.
- **Inputs**:
    - `out_cnt`: The number of elements in the `out` array, which must be at least 14.
    - `out`: A pointer to a `sock_filter` array where the filter policy will be stored.
    - `logfile_fd`: The file descriptor for the log file, used in syscall argument checks.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Check if `out_cnt` is at least 14 using `FD_TEST` macro.
    - Define a `sock_filter` array `filter` with 14 elements to specify the seccomp filter policy.
    - Load the architecture from `seccomp_data` and compare it with `ARCH_NR`; jump to `RET_KILL_PROCESS` if they do not match.
    - Load the syscall number and check if it is `SYS_write` or `SYS_fsync`; if not, jump to `RET_KILL_PROCESS`.
    - For `SYS_write`, check if the first argument is 2 or `logfile_fd`; allow the syscall if true, otherwise jump to `RET_KILL_PROCESS`.
    - For `SYS_fsync`, check if the first argument is `logfile_fd`; allow the syscall if true, otherwise jump to `RET_KILL_PROCESS`.
    - Use `fd_memcpy` to copy the `filter` array to the `out` array.
- **Output**: The `out` array is populated with a seccomp filter policy that allows or kills processes based on syscall checks.
