A unit test for the `fd_shred_tile` component with configuration and initialization logic.

# Purpose
This code is a C source file that serves as a test suite for a tile unit within a larger system. It is designed to initialize, configure, and test a specific component referred to as the "shred tile." The code includes conditional compilation to select between two different topologies, either "fdctl" or "firedancer," based on the `TEST_IS_FIREDANCER` macro. The main function initializes the testing environment, sets up a random number generator, and configures the tile under test using configuration paths and parameters. It then performs a series of checks and initializations, such as querying and setting configuration properties, and calls the `unprivileged_init` function to prepare the tile for testing.

The code imports several components, including a shared unit test API and topology configurations, and it defines a global configuration object. The test suite is structured to log notices and warnings, indicating the progress and status of the test. The test is currently marked as "under construction," suggesting that further test cases and validations are intended to be added. The code concludes by cleaning up resources, such as the random number generator, and halting the test environment. This file is intended to be executed as a standalone test, as indicated by the presence of the [`main`](<#main>) function.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `../../app/shared/fd_tile_unit_test.h`
- `../../app/fdctl/topology.c`
- `../../app/firedancer/topology.c`
- `fd_shred_tile.c`


# Global Variables

---
### config
- **Type**: `config_t[1]`
- **Description**: An array of one element of type `config_t`. This variable is used to store configuration data for the application.
- **Use**: Used to pass configuration data to various functions and components in the application.


# Functions

---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/disco/shred/test_shred_tile.c#L22>)

Initializes and runs a tile unit test, including setting up a random number generator, configuring topology, and performing test operations.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments.
    - `argv`: An array of command-line argument strings.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Call `fd_boot` to initialize the environment with command-line arguments.
    - Extract the random number generator seed from the command-line arguments using `fd_env_strip_cmdline_uint`.
    - Initialize a random number generator with `fd_rng_new` and join it with `fd_rng_join`.
    - Set up the tile unit test by calling `fd_tile_unit_test_init` with default and user-specified topology configurations.
    - Log the `is_firedancer` status using `FD_LOG_NOTICE`.
    - Query the `poh_shred` object ID from the configuration and verify it is valid with `FD_TEST`.
    - Join the gossip shred version using `fd_fseq_join` and set it to a specific value.
    - Call [`unprivileged_init`](<fd_shred_tile.c.md#unprivileged_init>) with the topology and shred tile.
    - Retrieve the shred context using `fd_topo_obj_laddr` and verify it with `FD_TEST`.
    - Log a warning indicating the test is under construction.
    - Delete the random number generator using `fd_rng_delete` and `fd_rng_leave`.
    - Log a notice indicating the test passed and call `fd_halt` to terminate the program.
- **Output**: Returns 0 to indicate successful execution.
- **Functions Called**:
    - [`unprivileged_init`](<fd_shred_tile.c.md#unprivileged_init>)
