Defines the `fd_shred_ctx_t` structure for managing shred tile contexts in the Firedancer codebase.

# Purpose
The code is a C header file that defines the structure `fd_shred_ctx_t`, which is used to manage the context for a "shred tile" in a distributed system. It includes necessary headers and forward declarations for types such as `fd_fec_resolver_t`, `fd_keyswitch_t`, and `fd_keyguard_client_t`. The `fd_shred_ctx_t` structure contains pointers to various components like `fd_shredder_t`, `fd_fec_resolver_t`, and `fd_keyswitch_t`, as well as fields for managing identity keys, round-robin identifiers, batch counts, and slot information. This structure is likely used to coordinate and track the shredding process within a specific operational context, ensuring that all shred tiles maintain consistent state information.

# Data Structures

---
### fd\_fec\_resolver\_t
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `shredder`: Pointer to an `fd_shredder_t` structure.
    - `resolver`: Pointer to an `fd_fec_resolver_t` structure.
    - `identity_key`: Array containing a single `fd_pubkey_t` public key.
    - `round_robin_id`: Unsigned long integer for round-robin identification.
    - `round_robin_cnt`: Unsigned long integer for round-robin count.
    - `batch_cnt`: Unsigned long integer for the number of batches shredded from PoH during the current slot.
    - `slot`: Unsigned long integer for the slot of the most recent microblock seen from PoH.
    - `keyswitch`: Pointer to an `fd_keyswitch_t` structure.
    - `keyguard_client`: Array containing a single `fd_keyguard_client_t` structure.
- **Description**: Defines the context for a shred tile, including pointers to various structures such as `fd_shredder_t`, `fd_fec_resolver_t`, and `fd_keyswitch_t`, as well as fields for managing round-robin operations, batch counts, and slot tracking.


---
### fd\_keyswitch\_t
- **Type**: ``fd_keyswitch_t``
- **Members**:
    - ``fd_keyswitch_private``: A forward declaration for the `fd_keyswitch_t` type.
- **Description**: `fd_keyswitch_t` is a typedef for a structure named `fd_keyswitch_private`, which is forward declared in the code. The actual definition of `fd_keyswitch_private` is not provided in the given code, indicating that it is likely defined elsewhere. This data structure is used within the `fd_shred_ctx_t` structure, suggesting it plays a role in the context of a shred tile, possibly related to key switching operations.


---
### fd\_keyguard\_client\_t
- **Type**: ``fd_keyguard_client_t``
- **Description**: `fd_keyguard_client_t` is a typedef for a forward-declared structure `fd_keyguard_client`. The actual structure definition is not provided in the given code, so details about its members and functionality are not available.


---
### fd\_shred\_ctx\_t
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `shredder`: Pointer to a `fd_shredder_t` structure.
    - `resolver`: Pointer to a `fd_fec_resolver_t` structure.
    - `identity_key`: Array containing a single `fd_pubkey_t` representing the public key.
    - `round_robin_id`: Unsigned long integer for the round-robin identifier.
    - `round_robin_cnt`: Unsigned long integer for the round-robin count.
    - `batch_cnt`: Unsigned long integer for the number of batches shredded from PoH during the current slot.
    - `slot`: Unsigned long integer for the slot of the most recent microblock seen from PoH.
    - `keyswitch`: Pointer to a `fd_keyswitch_t` structure.
    - `keyguard_client`: Array containing a single `fd_keyguard_client_t` structure.
- **Description**: Represents the context for a shred tile, containing pointers to various components such as a shredder, resolver, and keyswitch, as well as identifiers and counters for managing the shredding process and tracking the most recent microblock slot.
