Makefile for building and testing components in the `firedancer` codebase with conditional compilation.

# Purpose
The content is a Makefile script used to manage the build process and testing of various components in a software project. It uses conditional statements to check for specific features or architecture support, such as `FD_HAS_INT128` and `FD_ARCH_SUPPORTS_SANDBOX`, to determine which object files and unit tests to include. The `add-objs` function is called to add object files like `fd_shred_dest`, `fd_shredder`, and others to the build process, associating them with the `fd_disco` module. The `make-unit-test` function is used to define unit tests for components such as `test_shred_dest`, `test_fec_resolver`, and `test_stake_ci`, specifying their dependencies. The `run-unit-test` function executes these tests, ensuring that the components function correctly under the specified conditions.
