Makefile for building and testing components in the `firedancer` codebase with conditional checks.

# Purpose
This Makefile script conditionally includes headers and object files based on the presence of the `FD_HAS_INT128` flag. If `FD_HAS_INT128` is defined, it adds `fd_store.h` to the headers and `fd_store` and `fd_disco` to the object files. Additionally, if `FD_HAS_HOSTED` is defined, it creates and runs a unit test named `test_store` with dependencies on `fd_disco`, `fd_flamenco`, `fd_tango`, `fd_ballet`, and `fd_util`.
