Tests for circular queue operations and boundary conditions in the Firedancer codebase.

# Purpose
The code is a C program designed to test the functionality of a circular queue implementation, referred to as `fd_circq`. It includes several test functions: [`test_simple1`](<#test_simple1>), [`test_simple2`](<#test_simple2>), [`test_simple3`](<#test_simple3>), and [`test_bounds`](<#test_bounds>), each of which exercises different aspects of the circular queue's behavior. The tests involve operations such as pushing and popping elements from the queue, verifying the integrity of the data, and checking boundary conditions. The program uses a random number generator, `fd_rng`, to introduce variability in the tests, particularly in [`test_simple1`](<#test_simple1>) and [`test_simple3`](<#test_simple3>).

The [`main`](<#main>) function orchestrates the execution of these test functions. It initializes the environment with `fd_boot`, runs each test, and logs the results using `FD_LOG_NOTICE`. The program concludes with `fd_halt` to clean up before exiting. The inclusion of `fd_disco.h` and `fd_circq.h` suggests that these headers provide necessary declarations and definitions for the circular queue and possibly other utilities used in the tests. The program is structured to ensure that the circular queue implementation behaves as expected under various conditions, making it a test suite for validating the `fd_circq` functionality.

### test\_simple1<!-- {{#callable:test_simple1}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/disco/events/test_circq.c#L5>)

Tests the functionality of a circular queue by pushing a large number of randomly sized messages into it.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Declare a buffer `buf` of size 4224 bytes.
    - Create a circular queue `circq` using [`fd_circq_new`](<fd_circq.c.md#fd_circq_new>) and join it with [`fd_circq_join`](<fd_circq.c.md#fd_circq_join>).
    - Verify the successful creation of `circq` using `FD_TEST`.
    - Declare a random number generator `_rng` and initialize it with `fd_rng_new`, then join it with `fd_rng_join`.
    - Iterate 8192 * 8192 times, each time generating a random message size and pushing it to the back of the circular queue using [`fd_circq_push_back`](<fd_circq.c.md#fd_circq_push_back>).
    - Verify the successful push of each message using `FD_TEST`.
- **Output**: No return value; the function performs tests and uses assertions to verify behavior.
- **Functions Called**:
    - [`fd_circq_join`](<fd_circq.c.md#fd_circq_join>)
    - [`fd_circq_new`](<fd_circq.c.md#fd_circq_new>)

### test\_simple2<!-- {{#callable:test_simple2}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/disco/events/test_circq.c#L20>)

Tests the functionality of a circular queue by performing a series of push and pop operations and verifying the results.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Initialize a buffer `buf` and create a circular queue `circq` using [`fd_circq_new`](<fd_circq.c.md#fd_circq_new>) and [`fd_circq_join`](<fd_circq.c.md#fd_circq_join>).
    - Verify that `circq` is not null using `FD_TEST`.
    - Push a message of size 8 into the queue, set the first and last bytes to 'X' and 'A', respectively.
    - Pop the message from the front of the queue and verify its contents using `FD_TEST`.
    - Attempt to pop from the empty queue multiple times and verify that the result is null.
    - Push two messages into the queue, verify the queue count, and set their contents.
    - Pop each message and verify their contents.
    - Attempt to pop from the empty queue and verify that the result is null.
    - Push two more messages into the queue, set their contents, and pop one message to verify its contents.
    - Attempt to pop from the empty queue and verify that the result is null.
- **Output**: No return value; the function uses assertions to verify the correctness of the circular queue operations.
- **Functions Called**:
    - [`fd_circq_join`](<fd_circq.c.md#fd_circq_join>)
    - [`fd_circq_new`](<fd_circq.c.md#fd_circq_new>)

### test\_simple3<!-- {{#callable:test_simple3}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/disco/events/test_circq.c#L77>)

Simulates operations on a circular queue using random values for a specified number of iterations.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Declare a buffer `buf` with a size of 4224 bytes.
    - Create and join a circular queue `circq` using the buffer and a size of 128 bytes.
    - Verify the successful creation of the circular queue with `FD_TEST`.
    - Declare a random number generator `_rng` and join it with a seed of 6.
    - Iterate 8192 times, performing the following operations in each iteration:
    - Generate a random number between 0 and 1 using `fd_rng_ulong_roll` and, if the result is 0, pop an element from the front of the circular queue using [`fd_circq_pop_front`](<fd_circq.c.md#fd_circq_pop_front>).
    - Push a new element to the back of the circular queue using [`fd_circq_push_back`](<fd_circq.c.md#fd_circq_push_back>), with a random size between 1 and 256 and a random value between 1 and 25.
