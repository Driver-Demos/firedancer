Makefile for adding headers, objects, and running unit tests for `fd_circq` in the `firedancer` codebase.

# Purpose
The `Makefile` content defines build and test instructions for a software project. It adds headers and object files using the `add-hdrs` and `add-objs` functions, specifically for `fd_circq.h` and the objects `fd_circq` and `fd_disco`. It also sets up a unit test named `test_circq` with dependencies on `fd_disco`, `fd_flamenco`, `fd_tango`, and `fd_util`, and includes a command to run this unit test.
