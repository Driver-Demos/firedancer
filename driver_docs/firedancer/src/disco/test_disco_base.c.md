A stub for future tests with random number generation setup and teardown.

# Purpose
This code is a simple C program that initializes and finalizes a random number generator (RNG) environment. It includes the header file `fd_disco.h` and defines a [`main`](<#main>) function that takes command-line arguments. The program begins by calling `fd_boot` to initialize the environment with the provided arguments. It then creates and joins a new RNG instance using `fd_rng_new` and `fd_rng_join`. Although the program currently does not perform any operations with the RNG, it includes a comment indicating that it is a placeholder for future tests. The RNG is properly cleaned up with `fd_rng_leave` and `fd_rng_delete` before the program logs a "pass" message using `FD_LOG_NOTICE` and calls `fd_halt` to terminate the environment. The program returns 0 to indicate successful execution.
# Imports and Dependencies

[View Source →](<../../../../src/disco/test_disco_base.c#L3>)

Initializes the environment, sets up a random number generator, logs a notice, and halts the program.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The count of command-line arguments.
    - `argv`: The array of command-line argument strings.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Calls `fd_boot` to initialize the environment with command-line arguments.
    - Creates a random number generator using `fd_rng_new` and joins it with `fd_rng_join`.
    - Leaves and deletes the random number generator using `fd_rng_leave` and `fd_rng_delete`.
    - Logs a notice message 'pass' using `FD_LOG_NOTICE`.
    - Calls `fd_halt` to halt the program.
    - Returns 0 to indicate successful execution.
- **Output**: Returns 0 to indicate successful execution.
