Header file for reassembling FEC sets into replay order, managing forks, and handling equivocation in a network.

# Purpose
The `fd_reasm.h` file is a C header file that defines the interface for a module responsible for reassembling Forward Error Correction (FEC) sets into a specific replay order. This module is part of a larger system that processes data received over a network, specifically handling the reassembly of FEC sets as they are received via Turbine and Repair. The reassembly process ensures that each FEC set is delivered in the correct order, with a parent FEC set being delivered before its child. The module handles complex scenarios such as forks, which occur when an FEC set has multiple children, and equivocation, which involves duplicate FEC sets due to malicious behavior or software bugs.

The header file defines several key components and functions. It includes a structure `fd_reasm_fec_t` that represents an FEC set, containing metadata such as keys, pointers, and data attributes. The module uses a tree-like structure backed by three maps to manage the FEC sets: ancestry, frontier, and orphaned maps. Functions are provided for creating, joining, and managing the reassembly process, including inserting new FEC sets, querying existing ones, and handling the chaining of FEC sets. The module also includes mechanisms for handling forks and equivocation, ensuring that the reassembly process is robust against protocol violations. The file defines several constants and macros, such as `FD_REASM_SUCCESS` and `FD_REASM_ERR_UNIQUE`, to indicate the status of operations within the module.

- **Description**: `fd_reasm_t` is a data structure used to reassemble Forward Error Correction (FEC) sets into replay order as they are received over a network. It ensures that every FEC set is delivered in order by chaining it to its parent. The structure uses a tree-like organization backed by three maps: ancestry, frontier, and orphaned, to manage the state of each FEC set. The structure handles forks, which occur when a FEC set has more than one child, and manages equivocation by keying FEC sets with their merkle root. The structure provides functions for inserting, querying, and chaining FEC sets, ensuring that they are delivered in the correct order.
