Makefile for building and testing the `fd_reasm` component with conditional compilation flags.

# Purpose
The `Makefile` content defines conditional compilation and testing rules for a software project. If the macro `FD_HAS_INT128` is defined, it adds the object `fd_discof` to the `fd_reasm` target. If both `FD_HAS_INT128` and `FD_HAS_HOSTED` are defined, it creates and runs a unit test named `test_reasm` with dependencies on `fd_discof`, `fd_flamenco`, `fd_ballet`, and `fd_util`.
