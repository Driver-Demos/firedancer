Defines data structures and templates for managing FEC nodes and maps in a reassembly process.

# Purpose
The code is a C header file that defines private data structures and macros for managing a reassembly process, likely related to Forward Error Correction (FEC) in a network protocol context. It includes several template-based data structures such as pools, maps, doubly linked lists, and deques, which are used to manage and organize `fd_reasm_fec_t` elements. These elements represent FEC nodes that are part of a reassembly tree structure. The header file is not intended to be a standalone executable but rather a component to be included in other C source files.

The primary data structure defined in this file is the `fd_reasm` struct, which contains various maps and lists to manage the state of the reassembly process. The maps, such as `ancestry`, `frontier`, `orphaned`, and `subtrees`, are used to track different categories of FEC nodes, while the doubly linked list `subtreel` and the deques `bfs` and `out` are used for internal processing and output management. The `slot_mr` map associates slots with block identifiers, facilitating the organization of data blocks during reassembly. The file uses macros to define and include template implementations for these data structures, ensuring efficient and type-safe operations.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `fd_reasm.h`
- `../../util/tmpl/fd_pool.c`
- `../../util/tmpl/fd_map_chain.c`
- `../../util/tmpl/fd_dlist.c`
- `../../util/tmpl/fd_deque_dynamic.c`
- `../../util/tmpl/fd_map_dynamic.c`


# Data Structures

---
### slot\_mr\_t
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `slot`: An unsigned long integer representing a slot identifier.
    - `block_id`: A `fd_hash_t` type representing a block identifier.
- **Description**: Defines a structure with two members: `slot`, which is an unsigned long integer used as a slot identifier, and `block_id`, which is a hash type used to identify a block. This structure is likely used to map or associate slots with specific block identifiers in a larger system.


---
### fd\_reasm
- **Type**: ``struct fd_reasm``
- **Members**:
    - `slot0`: Special initialization slot that chains the first FEC.
    - `root`: Pool index of the root FEC set.
    - `pool`: Pool of FEC nodes backing the maps and tree.
    - `ancestry`: Map of mr to fec for non-leaves of the connected tree.
    - `frontier`: Map of mr to fec for leaves of the connected tree.
    - `orphaned`: Map of mr to fec for non-roots of the orphaned subtrees.
    - `subtrees`: Map of mr to fec for roots of the orphaned subtrees.
    - `_subtrlf`: Internal doubly linked list of elements in subtrees in no particular order.
    - `subtreel`: Join to the doubly linked list.
    - `bfs`: Internal queue of pool indexes for BFS.
    - `out`: Delivery queue of pool indexes to output.
    - `slot_mr`: Map of slot to mr.
- **Description**: Aligns to 128 bytes and manages FEC (Forward Error Correction) nodes and their relationships in a tree structure, including connected and orphaned subtrees, using various maps and queues for efficient data handling and processing.
