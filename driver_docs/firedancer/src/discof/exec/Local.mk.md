Makefile logic to add objects for `fd_exec_tile` and `fd_discof` if `FD_HAS_INT128` is defined.

# Purpose
The `Makefile` snippet uses a conditional directive to check if the macro `FD_HAS_INT128` is defined. If it is defined, the `add-objs` function is called with the arguments `fd_exec_tile` and `fd_discof`. This operation adds the object files associated with these targets to the build process, indicating that they are only included when the `FD_HAS_INT128` feature is available.
