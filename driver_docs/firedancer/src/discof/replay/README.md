Epoch fork management, execution slice parsing, microblock replay, seccomp policies, and build configuration.

## Folders
- **[generated](generated/README.md)**: Defines a seccomp filter policy for syscall control based on architecture and specific syscalls.

## Files
- **[fd_exec.h](fd_exec.h.md)**: Defines task types and message structures for transaction execution and signature verification in exec tiles.
- **[fd_rdisp.c](fd_rdisp.c.md)**: Implements a system for managing account-conflict graphs in a transaction processing environment, using data structures and algorithms to handle graph traversal, memory optimization, and transaction scheduling.
- **[fd_rdisp.h](fd_rdisp.h.md)**: Defines methods for building and executing a DAG of transactions with maximum parallelism.
- **[fd_rdisp_simple.c](fd_rdisp_simple.c.md)**: Implements a dispatcher for managing transaction blocks with staging lanes, pools, and maps.
- **[fd_replay_tile.c](fd_replay_tile.c.md)**: Implements a replay tile for processing blockchain data, managing transactions, and coordinating with other components in a distributed system.
- **[fd_replay_tile.h](fd_replay_tile.h.md)**: Defines data structures and constants for replay tile operations, including slot completion and voting.
- **[fd_replay_tile.seccomppolicy](fd_replay_tile.seccomppolicy.md)**: Defines security policies for logging behavior, including file descriptor management and log synchronization.
- **[fd_sched.c](fd_sched.c.md)**: Implements a scheduling system for transaction processing, including block management and task dispatching.
- **[fd_sched.h](fd_sched.h.md)**: Header file for a transaction scheduler that manages lane-based scheduling, state transitions, and task prioritization for replay execution.
- **[fd_vote_tracker.c](fd_vote_tracker.c.md)**: Implements a vote tracker with a deque and map for managing and querying vote signatures.
- **[fd_vote_tracker.h](fd_vote_tracker.h.md)**: Defines the `fd_vote_tracker` structure and functions for creating, joining, inserting, and querying vote signatures.
- **[Local.mk](Local.mk.md)**: Makefile for adding headers, objects, and unit tests with conditional logic for `fd_discof`.
- **[rdisp_format_block_for_test.py](rdisp_format_block_for_test.py.md)**: Formats Solana block data for testing by processing transactions and writing binary output.
- **[test_rdisp.c](test_rdisp.c.md)**: Tests for the `fd_rdisp` dispatcher, including transaction addition, scheduling, and block management.
