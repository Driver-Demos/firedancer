Defines security policies for logging behavior, including file descriptor management and log synchronization.

# Purpose
The configuration file manages logging behavior for a software system. It defines a file descriptor `logfile_fd` that is used to open a log file during boot, where all log messages are recorded. The configuration specifies that log messages of level 'WARNING' and above are written to the STDERR pipe, while all messages are logged to the file. The `write` operation checks if the file descriptor is either STDERR (descriptor 2) or the `logfile_fd`, ensuring messages are directed to the correct output. Additionally, the `fsync` operation ensures that log messages of level 'WARNING' and above are immediately synchronized to disk when written to the log file, using the `logfile_fd` descriptor.
