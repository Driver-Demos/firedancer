Defines task types and message structures for transaction execution and signature verification in exec tiles.

# Purpose
This C header file defines constants, data structures, and types for managing execution tasks in a distributed system. It includes definitions for task types such as transaction execution (`FD_EXEC_TT_TXN_EXEC`), transaction signature verification (`FD_EXEC_TT_TXN_SIGVERIFY`), account hash verification (`FD_EXEC_TT_LTHASH`), and PoH hash verification (`FD_EXEC_TT_POH_VERIFY`). The file also defines message structures for communication between replay tiles and execution tiles, such as `fd_exec_txn_exec_msg` and `fd_exec_txn_sigverify_msg`, which carry information about tasks to be executed. Additionally, it defines structures like `fd_exec_txn_exec_done_msg` and `fd_exec_task_done_msg` to notify the replay tile when tasks are completed, including any errors encountered. The header uses include guards to prevent multiple inclusions and contains a placeholder comment for setting correct epochs for testnet and mainnet.
# Data Structures

---
### fd\_exec\_txn\_exec\_msg
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `bank_idx`: Index of the bank in the bank pool.
    - `txn_idx`: Index of the transaction.
    - `txn`: Pointer to the transaction data.
- **Description**: Defines a message structure used to send transaction execution tasks from the replay tile to the exec tiles, including indices for the bank and transaction, and a pointer to the transaction data.


---
### fd\_exec\_txn\_exec\_msg\_t
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `bank_idx`: Index of the bank in the bank pool.
    - `txn_idx`: Index of the transaction.
    - `txn`: Pointer to the transaction data.
- **Description**: Defines a message structure used to send transaction execution tasks from the replay tile to the exec tiles, including indices for the bank and transaction, and a pointer to the transaction data.


---
### fd\_exec\_txn\_sigverify\_msg
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - ``bank_idx``: An unsigned long integer that identifies the bank index.
    - ``txn_idx``: An unsigned long integer that identifies the transaction index.
    - ``txn``: A pointer to a transaction structure (`fd_txn_p_t`).
- **Description**: Holds information for a transaction signature verification task, including the bank index, transaction index, and a pointer to the transaction data.


---
### fd\_exec\_txn\_sigverify\_msg\_t
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `bank_idx`: Index of the bank in the bank pool.
    - `txn_idx`: Index of the transaction.
    - `txn`: Pointer to the transaction data.
- **Description**: Used to send transaction signature verification tasks from the replay tile to the execution tiles, containing information about the bank and transaction indices, as well as a pointer to the transaction data.


---
### fd\_exec\_task\_msg
- **Type**: `union`
- **Members**:
    - `txn_exec`: Contains a `fd_exec_txn_exec_msg_t` structure for transaction execution tasks.
    - `txn_sigverify`: Contains a `fd_exec_txn_sigverify_msg_t` structure for transaction signature verification tasks.
- **Description**: The `fd_exec_task_msg` union is used to represent a task message that can be either a transaction execution message or a transaction signature verification message. It allows the selection of one of these two types of task messages to be sent from the replay tile to the exec tiles, facilitating the processing of different task types in a flexible manner.


---
### fd\_exec\_task\_msg\_t
- **Type**: `union`
- **Members**:
    - `txn_exec`: Contains a `fd_exec_txn_exec_msg_t` structure for transaction execution tasks.
    - `txn_sigverify`: Contains a `fd_exec_txn_sigverify_msg_t` structure for transaction signature verification tasks.
- **Description**: Encapsulates different types of task messages that can be sent from the replay tile to the exec tiles, specifically for transaction execution and transaction signature verification tasks. This union allows for the selection of the appropriate task message type based on the task to be performed.


---
### fd\_exec\_txn\_exec\_done\_msg
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `txn_idx`: An unsigned long integer that identifies the transaction index.
    - `err`: An integer that indicates if an error occurred during transaction execution.
- **Description**: Contains information about the completion status of a transaction execution task, including the transaction index and any error that occurred during execution.


---
### fd\_exec\_txn\_exec\_done\_msg\_t
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `txn_idx`: Stores the index of the transaction.
    - `err`: Indicates if an error occurred during task execution.
- **Description**: Communicates the completion status of a transaction execution task from exec tiles to the replay tile, including the transaction index and any error that occurred.


---
### fd\_exec\_txn\_sigverify\_done\_msg
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `txn_idx`: Index of the transaction related to the signature verification.
    - `err`: Error code indicating the result of the signature verification task.
- **Description**: Communicates the completion status of a transaction signature verification task from execution tiles to the replay tile, including the transaction index and any error code.


---
### fd\_exec\_txn\_sigverify\_done\_msg\_t
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `txn_idx`: The index of the transaction that has been processed.
    - `err`: The error code indicating the result of the signature verification task.
- **Description**: Communicates the completion status of a transaction signature verification task from execution tiles to the replay tile, including the transaction index and any error code.


---
### fd\_exec\_task\_done\_msg
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `bank_idx`: Index of the bank in the bank pool.
    - `txn_exec`: Array of `fd_exec_txn_exec_done_msg_t` representing transaction execution completion messages.
    - `txn_sigverify`: Array of `fd_exec_txn_sigverify_done_msg_t` representing transaction signature verification completion messages.
- **Description**: Communicates the completion of a task from exec tiles to the replay tile, indicating that any observable side effects of the task, such as updates to accounts, are fully visible on any other exec tile. It includes the bank index and a union of messages for either transaction execution or signature verification completion.


---
### fd\_exec\_task\_done\_msg\_t
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - ``bank_idx``: Index of the bank in the bank pool.
    - ``txn_exec``: Array containing a single `fd_exec_txn_exec_done_msg_t` structure.
    - ``txn_sigverify``: Array containing a single `fd_exec_txn_sigverify_done_msg_t` structure.
- **Description**: Communicates the completion of a task from exec tiles to the replay tile, indicating that any observable side effects of the task, such as updates to accounts, are fully visible on other exec tiles. It includes the bank index and a union of messages for transaction execution and signature verification completion.
