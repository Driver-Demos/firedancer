Makefile for adding headers, objects, and unit tests with conditional logic for `fd_discof`.

# Purpose
This Makefile script is used to manage the build process for a software project. It defines rules to add header files and object files using the `add-hdrs` and `add-objs` functions, respectively. The script also includes a unit test setup with `make-unit-test` and `run-unit-test` for the `test_rdisp` component. Conditional compilation is supported with checks for `FD_HAS_INT128` and `FD_HAS_ZSTD`, where the presence of these flags determines whether additional object files like `fd_sched` and `fd_replay_tile` are included. If `FD_HAS_ZSTD` is not defined, a warning is issued indicating that the replay functionality is skipped due to the absence of the `zstd` library.
