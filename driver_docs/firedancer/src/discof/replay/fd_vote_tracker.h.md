Defines the `fd_vote_tracker` structure and functions for creating, joining, inserting, and querying vote signatures.

# Purpose
The code is a C header file that defines the interface for a vote tracking system. It includes function prototypes and type definitions related to the `fd_vote_tracker` structure. The functions include [`fd_vote_tracker_align`](<#fd_vote_tracker_align>) and [`fd_vote_tracker_footprint`](<#fd_vote_tracker_footprint>), which likely provide alignment and memory footprint information, respectively. The [`fd_vote_tracker_new`](<#fd_vote_tracker_new>) function initializes a new vote tracker with a given memory location and seed, while [`fd_vote_tracker_join`](<#fd_vote_tracker_join>) allows joining an existing vote tracker. The [`fd_vote_tracker_insert`](<#fd_vote_tracker_insert>) function adds a vote signature to the tracker, and [`fd_vote_tracker_query_sig`](<#fd_vote_tracker_query_sig>) checks for the presence of a specific vote signature. The file includes necessary headers for utility and type definitions and uses macros to manage function prototypes.
# Imports and Dependencies

# Global Variables

---
### fd\_vote\_tracker
- **Type**: ``struct fd_vote_tracker``
- **Description**: Defines a structure for tracking votes in a system. The structure is used to manage and query vote signatures.
- **Use**: Used to create, manage, and query vote signatures in a voting system.


# Data Structures

---
### fd\_vote\_tracker\_t
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Description**: `fd_vote_tracker_t` is a typedef for a forward-declared `struct fd_vote_tracker`, which is used in functions related to vote tracking operations such as alignment, footprint calculation, creation, joining, insertion, and querying of vote signatures.


# Function Declarations (Public API)

---
### fd\_vote\_tracker\_align<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_vote_tracker_align}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/discof/replay/fd_vote_tracker.h#L14>)

Returns the alignment requirement for a vote tracker.
- **Description**: Use this function to get the alignment requirement for a vote tracker. This is necessary when allocating memory for a vote tracker to ensure proper alignment. Call this function before creating or joining a vote tracker to determine the correct alignment.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Output**: Returns the alignment requirement as an unsigned long integer.
- **See Also**: [`fd_vote_tracker_align`](<fd_vote_tracker.c.md#fd_vote_tracker_align>)  (Implementation)


---
### fd\_vote\_tracker\_footprint<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_vote_tracker_footprint}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/discof/replay/fd_vote_tracker.h#L17>)

Calculates the memory footprint required for a vote tracker.
- **Description**: Use this function to determine the amount of memory needed to allocate a vote tracker. This is useful when planning memory allocation for vote tracking operations. Ensure that the system has sufficient memory available to accommodate the calculated footprint before proceeding with allocation.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Output**: Returns the size in bytes of the memory footprint required for a vote tracker.
- **See Also**: [`fd_vote_tracker_footprint`](<fd_vote_tracker.c.md#fd_vote_tracker_footprint>)  (Implementation)


---
### fd\_vote\_tracker\_new<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_vote_tracker_new}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/discof/replay/fd_vote_tracker.h#L20>)

Creates a new vote tracker instance in the provided memory.
- **Description**: Use this function to initialize a new vote tracker in a pre-allocated memory region. The memory must be aligned according to the alignment requirements of the vote tracker. This function also initializes internal structures necessary for the vote tracker's operation. If the memory is null or misaligned, the function logs a warning and returns null. Ensure that the memory region is large enough to accommodate the vote tracker footprint.
- **Inputs**:
    - `mem`: A pointer to the pre-allocated memory where the vote tracker will be created. Must not be null and must be aligned to the alignment requirements of the vote tracker. If null or misaligned, the function returns null.
    - `seed`: An unsigned long integer used to seed internal structures of the vote tracker. This value influences the initial state of the tracker.
- **Output**: Returns a pointer to the newly created vote tracker if successful, or null if the memory is null, misaligned, or if there is an error during initialization.
- **See Also**: [`fd_vote_tracker_new`](<fd_vote_tracker.c.md#fd_vote_tracker_new>)  (Implementation)


---
### fd\_vote\_tracker\_join<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_vote_tracker_join}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/discof/replay/fd_vote_tracker.h#L24>)

Converts a memory pointer to a vote tracker object.
- **Description**: Use this function to interpret a memory region as a `fd_vote_tracker_t` object. This function is typically called after allocating or initializing memory for a vote tracker. Ensure that the memory pointed to by `mem` is correctly aligned and sized according to the requirements of a `fd_vote_tracker_t` object. This function does not perform any validation on the memory content.
- **Inputs**:
    - `mem`: A pointer to a memory region that will be interpreted as a `fd_vote_tracker_t` object. The memory must be properly aligned and sized. The caller retains ownership of the memory. Passing a null pointer results in undefined behavior.
- **Output**: Returns a pointer to a `fd_vote_tracker_t` object located at the specified memory address.
- **See Also**: [`fd_vote_tracker_join`](<fd_vote_tracker.c.md#fd_vote_tracker_join>)  (Implementation)


---
### fd\_vote\_tracker\_insert<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_vote_tracker_insert}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/discof/replay/fd_vote_tracker.h#L27>)

Inserts a vote signature into the vote tracker.
- **Description**: Use this function to add a new vote signature to the specified vote tracker. If the vote tracker is full, the function removes the oldest vote signature to make space for the new one. This function must be called with a valid vote tracker and a non-null vote signature. Ensure that the vote tracker is properly initialized before calling this function.
- **Inputs**:
    - `vote_tracker`: A pointer to an `fd_vote_tracker_t` structure. This must be a valid and initialized vote tracker. The caller retains ownership and must ensure it is not null.
    - `vote_sig`: A pointer to a constant `fd_signature_t` structure representing the vote signature to insert. This must not be null, and the caller retains ownership.
- **Output**: None
- **See Also**: [`fd_vote_tracker_insert`](<fd_vote_tracker.c.md#fd_vote_tracker_insert>)  (Implementation)


---
### fd\_vote\_tracker\_query\_sig<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_vote_tracker_query_sig}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/discof/replay/fd_vote_tracker.h#L31>)

Checks if a signature exists in the vote tracker.
- **Description**: Use this function to verify if a specific vote signature is present in the given vote tracker. This function is useful when you need to confirm the existence of a vote signature within the tracker. Ensure that the `vote_tracker` is properly initialized and joined before calling this function. The function does not modify the state of the vote tracker or the signature.
- **Inputs**:
    - `vote_tracker`: A pointer to an `fd_vote_tracker_t` structure. Must not be null and must point to a valid, initialized vote tracker.
    - `vote_sig`: A pointer to a constant `fd_signature_t` structure representing the vote signature to query. Must not be null.
- **Output**: Returns a non-zero integer if the signature exists in the vote tracker, otherwise returns zero.
- **See Also**: [`fd_vote_tracker_query_sig`](<fd_vote_tracker.c.md#fd_vote_tracker_query_sig>)  (Implementation)
