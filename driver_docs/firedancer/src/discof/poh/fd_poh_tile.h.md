Defines data structures for PoH reset and leader beginning in the Firedancer codebase.

# Purpose
This C header file defines two structures, `fd_poh_reset` and `fd_poh_begin_leader`, which are used in the context of a Proof of History (PoH) implementation. The `fd_poh_reset` structure contains fields for managing PoH reset events, including a `timestamp`, `completed_slot`, `completed_blockhash`, and other parameters related to slot and tick management. The `fd_poh_begin_leader` structure is used to represent the beginning of a leader slot, with fields for `slot` and `hashcnt_per_tick`. The file includes a utility header, `fd_util_base.h`, which suggests that it relies on some base utilities defined elsewhere. The header guards prevent multiple inclusions of this file, ensuring that the structures are defined only once during compilation.

# Data Structures

---
### fd\_poh\_reset
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `timestamp`: Stores the time at which the reset occurred.
    - `completed_slot`: Indicates the last completed slot number.
    - `completed_blockhash`: Holds the hash of the last completed block as a 32-byte array.
    - `hashcnt_per_tick`: Specifies the number of hashes computed per tick.
    - `ticks_per_slot`: Defines the number of ticks in each slot.
    - `tick_duration_ns`: Represents the duration of each tick in nanoseconds.
    - `next_leader_slot`: Indicates the slot number for the next leader.
    - `max_microblocks_in_slot`: Specifies the maximum number of microblocks allowed in a slot.
    - `completed_block_id`: Stores the ID of the last completed block as a 32-byte array.
- **Description**: The `fd_poh_reset` structure is used to store information related to the reset state of a Proof of History (PoH) ledger. It includes details such as the timestamp of the reset, the last completed slot and block, the number of hashes per tick, the number of ticks per slot, the duration of each tick, the next leader slot, and the maximum number of microblocks in a slot. This structure is essential for managing and tracking the state of the PoH ledger during resets.

### fd\_poh\_reset\_t
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `timestamp`: Stores the time at which the reset occurred.
    - `completed_slot`: Indicates the last completed slot number.
    - `completed_blockhash`: Holds the hash of the last completed block as a 32-byte array.
    - `hashcnt_per_tick`: Specifies the number of hashes computed per tick.
    - `ticks_per_slot`: Defines the number of ticks in each slot.
    - `tick_duration_ns`: Represents the duration of each tick in nanoseconds.
    - `next_leader_slot`: Indicates the slot number for the next leader.
    - `max_microblocks_in_slot`: Specifies the maximum number of microblocks allowed in a slot.
    - `completed_block_id`: Stores the ID of the last completed block as a 32-byte array.
- **Description**: Represents the state of a reset operation in a Proof of History (PoH) system, capturing details such as timing, slot completion, block hashes, and configuration parameters for slot and tick management.


---
### fd\_poh\_begin\_leader
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `slot`: Stores the slot number as an unsigned long integer.
    - `hashcnt_per_tick`: Stores the hash count per tick as an unsigned long integer.
- **Description**: Defines a structure to store information about the beginning of a leader's term, including the slot number and the hash count per tick.


---
### fd\_poh\_begin\_leader\_t
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `slot`: Stores the slot number for the leader.
    - `hashcnt_per_tick`: Indicates the number of hashes per tick.
- **Description**: Defines the beginning of a leader's term in a Proof of History (PoH) system, specifying the slot number and the hash count per tick for the leader's duration.
