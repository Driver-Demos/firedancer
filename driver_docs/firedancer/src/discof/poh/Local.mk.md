Makefile logic to add objects `fd_poh_tile` and `fd_poh` if `FD_HAS_ALLOCA` is defined.

# Purpose
The `Makefile` snippet uses a conditional directive to check if the macro `FD_HAS_ALLOCA` is defined. If it is defined, the `add-objs` function is called to add the object files `fd_poh_tile`, `fd_poh`, and `fd_discof` to the build process. This configuration helps manage the inclusion of specific object files based on the presence of the `FD_HAS_ALLOCA` macro.
