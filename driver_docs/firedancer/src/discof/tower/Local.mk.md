Makefile logic to add objects for `fd_tower_tile` and `fd_discof` if `FD_HAS_INT128` is defined.

# Purpose
The `Makefile` snippet conditionally adds object files to the build process. If the macro `FD_HAS_INT128` is defined, it invokes the `add-objs` function to include `fd_tower_tile` and `fd_discof` in the build. This ensures that these object files are only compiled when the system supports 128-bit integers.
