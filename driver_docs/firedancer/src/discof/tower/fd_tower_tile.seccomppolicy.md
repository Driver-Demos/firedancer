Defines security policies for file descriptor operations in the Firedancer tower component.

# Purpose
The configuration file defines file descriptor management and logging behavior for a software system. It specifies that log messages are written to a file and/or pipe, with messages of 'WARNING' level and above also directed to the `STDERR` pipe. The file descriptors `logfile_fd`, `checkpt_fd`, and `restore_fd` are used to manage logging, checkpointing, and restoration processes. The `write` operation is permitted for `STDERR`, `logfile_fd`, and `checkpt_fd`, while the `read` and `fstat` operations are restricted to `restore_fd`. Additionally, the `fsync` operation is configured to ensure that changes to the log and checkpoint files are immediately written to disk, enhancing data integrity.
