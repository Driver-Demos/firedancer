Makefile logic to conditionally add objects for gossip tiles if 128-bit integers are available.

# Purpose
The `Makefile` snippet uses a conditional directive to check if the macro `FD_HAS_INT128` is defined. If it is defined, the `add-objs` function is called to add the object files `fd_discof` to the targets `fd_gossip_tile` and `fd_gossvf_tile`. This configuration ensures that these object files are included in the build process only when the `FD_HAS_INT128` feature is available.
