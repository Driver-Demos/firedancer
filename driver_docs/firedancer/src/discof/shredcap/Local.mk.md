Makefile logic to add objects for `fd_shredcap_tile` and `fd_discof` if `FD_HAS_INT128` is defined.

# Purpose
The `Makefile` snippet conditionally adds object files to the build process. If the macro `FD_HAS_INT128` is defined, it invokes the `add-objs` function to include the object files `fd_shredcap_tile` and `fd_discof` in the build. This conditional inclusion allows for flexibility in the build process based on the presence of the `FD_HAS_INT128` feature.
