Defines security policies for file descriptors related to logging and archiving in the Firedancer system.

# Purpose
The configuration file defines the logging behavior for a software system. It specifies several file descriptors, such as `logfile_fd`, `shreds_fd`, `requests_fd`, `fec_fd`, and `peers_fd`, which are used to manage log files and data streams. Log messages are written to a file and/or a pipe, with messages of 'WARNING' level and above also directed to the `STDERR` pipe. The configuration ensures that the boot process assigns descriptor 2 to `STDERR`. Additionally, the file specifies that the `fsync` operation is performed on the `logfile_fd` to ensure that 'WARNING' level messages and above are immediately synchronized to disk, maintaining data integrity.
