Makefile for conditional compilation and testing of components in the `fd_discof` module.

# Purpose
The Makefile content defines build rules and conditions for compiling and testing various components of a software project. It uses conditional statements to include headers and object files based on the presence of specific features, such as `FD_HAS_SSE`, `FD_HAS_ZSTD`, `FD_HAS_INT128`, and `FD_HAS_HOSTED`. The `add-hdrs` and `add-objs` functions are used to add header and object files to the build process, respectively. The file also specifies unit tests and fuzz tests to be created and executed, using `make-unit-test`, `run-unit-test`, and `make-fuzz-test` functions, ensuring that different components are tested under various conditions. This configuration allows for a modular and conditional build process, adapting to the available features and ensuring comprehensive testing.
