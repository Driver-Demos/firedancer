Defines a state machine for downloading or reading snapshots and managing snapshot states.

# Purpose
This C header file defines constants, a function, and a data structure related to the operation of a "snapct tile," which is a state machine for handling snapshot data. The snapct tile can download snapshots from a network or read them from disk, producing a byte stream for downstream processing. The file defines several states, such as `FD_SNAPCT_STATE_WAITING_FOR_PEERS` and `FD_SNAPCT_STATE_READING_FULL_HTTP`, which represent different stages in the snapshot handling process. The [`fd_snapct_state_str`](<#fd_snapct_state_str>) function converts these state constants into human-readable strings. Additionally, the `fd_snapct_update_t` structure is defined to store information about snapshot updates, including the type of snapshot and whether it is downloaded or read from a local path.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `../../util/fd_util_base.h`


# Data Structures

---
### fd\_snapct\_update\_t
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `type`: Indicates the type of snapshot, either full or incremental.
    - `is_download`: Indicates if the snapshot is downloaded (1) or read from disk (0).
    - `read_path`: Stores the file path from which the snapshot is read.
- **Description**: Defines a structure to manage snapshot updates, specifying the type of snapshot, whether it is downloaded or read from disk, and the path to the snapshot file.


# Functions

---
### fd\_snapct\_state\_str<!-- {{#callable:fd_snapct_state_str}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/discof/restore/fd_snapct_tile.h#L33>)

Maps a given state code to its corresponding string representation for the snapct tile state machine.
- **Inputs**:
    - `state`: An unsigned long integer representing the state code of the snapct tile.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Use a switch statement to match the input `state` with predefined state codes.
    - Return the corresponding string for each matched state code.
    - If the `state` does not match any predefined state code, return "unknown".
- **Output**: A constant character pointer to the string representation of the input state code.
