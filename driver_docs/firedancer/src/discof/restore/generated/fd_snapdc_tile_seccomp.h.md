Defines a seccomp filter policy for syscall handling with architecture-specific checks and actions.

# Purpose
The code is a C header file that defines a seccomp (secure computing mode) filter policy for a specific application. It is generated automatically and should not be edited manually. The file includes several Linux headers related to auditing, capabilities, filtering, and system calls, which are necessary for defining and implementing the seccomp filter. The filter is designed to restrict the system calls that a process can make, enhancing security by allowing only specific, predefined system calls.

The [`populate_sock_filter_policy_fd_snapdc_tile`](<#populate_sock_filter_policy_fd_snapdc_tile>) function is the main component of this file. It initializes a `struct sock_filter` array with a sequence of BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter) instructions. These instructions enforce a policy that allows only certain system calls (`SYS_write`, `SYS_fsync`, and `SYS_exit`) and checks specific conditions on their arguments. If a system call does not match the allowed criteria, the process is terminated using `SECCOMP_RET_KILL_PROCESS`. The function uses architecture-specific constants to ensure compatibility with the runtime environment. The filter is applied by copying the defined instructions into an output buffer, which is then used to enforce the seccomp policy.

# Global Variables

---
### sock\_filter\_policy\_fd\_snapdc\_tile\_instr\_cnt
- **Type**: ``unsigned int``
- **Description**: Defines the number of instructions in the socket filter policy for the `fd_snapdc_tile` component. This constant is used to ensure that the correct number of filter instructions are processed.
- **Use**: Used to verify that the `populate_sock_filter_policy_fd_snapdc_tile` function processes the correct number of filter instructions.

[View Source →](<../../../../../../src/discof/restore/generated/fd_snapdc_tile_seccomp.h#L26>)

Populates a `sock_filter` array with a predefined seccomp filter policy to control system call permissions.
- **Inputs**:
    - `out_cnt`: The number of elements in the `out` array, which must be at least 17.
    - `out`: A pointer to a `sock_filter` array where the filter policy will be copied.
    - `logfile_fd`: The file descriptor used in the filter policy to allow specific system calls.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Check if `out_cnt` is at least 17 using `FD_TEST` macro.
    - Define a `sock_filter` array `filter` with 17 elements to specify the seccomp filter policy.
    - Load the architecture from `seccomp_data` and compare it with `ARCH_NR`; jump to `RET_KILL_PROCESS` if they do not match.
    - Load the syscall number and check if it matches `SYS_write`, `SYS_fsync`, or `SYS_exit`; jump to specific labels if matched.
    - For `SYS_write`, load the first syscall argument and check if it is 2 or `logfile_fd`; allow or kill the process based on the result.
    - For `SYS_fsync`, load the first syscall argument and check if it is `logfile_fd`; allow or kill the process based on the result.
    - For `SYS_exit`, load the first syscall argument and check if it is 0; allow or kill the process based on the result.
    - Copy the `filter` array to the `out` array using `fd_memcpy`.
- **Output**: The `out` array is populated with the seccomp filter policy.
