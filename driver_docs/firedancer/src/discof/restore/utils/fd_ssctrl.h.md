Defines state machine constants and control message structures for synchronizing snapshot processing tiles.

# Purpose
This C header file defines constants, data structures, and control flow for managing the state of snapshot processing in a distributed system. It includes state definitions for snapshot tiles, such as `FD_SNAPSHOT_STATE_IDLE`, `FD_SNAPSHOT_STATE_PROCESSING`, and `FD_SNAPSHOT_STATE_ERROR`, which represent different stages of the snapshot lifecycle. The file also defines message types like `FD_SNAPSHOT_MSG_CTRL_INIT_FULL` and `FD_SNAPSHOT_MSG_CTRL_FAIL` to control the flow of snapshot processing and error handling. Additionally, it declares two structures, `fd_ssctrl_init_t` and `fd_ssctrl_meta_t`, which are used for initializing snapshot loading and communicating metadata about snapshots, respectively. The header ensures synchronization across tiles in the system to maintain a consistent state during snapshot operations.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `../../../util/net/fd_net_headers.h`


# Data Structures

---
### fd\_ssctrl\_init\_t
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `file`: An integer that specifies the file descriptor.
    - `addr`: A `fd_ip4_port_t` type that specifies the IP address and port.
- **Description**: Defines the initialization parameters for a control message, specifying a file descriptor and an IP address with a port for network communication.


---
### fd\_ssctrl\_meta\_t
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `total_sz`: The total size of the snapshot in bytes.
    - `name`: The name of the snapshot, stored as a character array with a maximum length defined by `PATH_MAX`.
- **Description**: Contains metadata about a downloaded snapshot, including its total size and name.
