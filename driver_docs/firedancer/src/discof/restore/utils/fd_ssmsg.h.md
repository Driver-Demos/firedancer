Defines data structures and functions for managing snapshot manifests, vote accounts, and stake delegations.

# Purpose
The code is a C header file that defines data structures and functions related to snapshot manifests in a distributed system. It includes several `struct` definitions that represent various components of a snapshot, such as vote accounts, stake delegations, epoch stakes, inflation parameters, and fee rate governors. These structures are used to store and manage information about the state of the system at a particular point in time, including details about accounts, stakes, inflation, and transaction fees.

The file also defines several inline functions for handling snapshot messages and converting slot numbers to fragment metadata. The [`fd_ssmsg_sig`](<#fd_ssmsg_sig>) and [`fd_ssmsg_sig_message`](<#fd_ssmsg_sig_message>) functions are used to extract and handle message signatures, while [`fd_ssmsg_slot_to_frag`](<#fd_ssmsg_slot_to_frag>) and [`fd_ssmsg_frag_to_slot`](<#fd_ssmsg_frag_to_slot>) convert between slot numbers and their low and high 32-bit representations. The header file includes constants that define different types of snapshot messages, such as full and incremental snapshot manifests. The file is intended to be included in other C source files to provide access to these data structures and functions, facilitating the management and restoration of system snapshots.
