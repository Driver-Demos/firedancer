Defines security policies for logging and shutdown operations in the Firedancer application.

# Purpose
The configuration file defines logging and shutdown behaviors for a software system. It specifies that log messages are written to a file and/or a pipe, with messages of 'WARNING' level and above also directed to the STDERR pipe. The file descriptor for logging is identified by `logfile_fd`, and the boot process ensures that descriptor 2 is always STDERR. Additionally, 'WARNING' level messages and above trigger an immediate fsync to the disk for the log file, ensuring data integrity. The shutdown process is managed by calling `exit` when the argument is 0, indicating a normal termination.
