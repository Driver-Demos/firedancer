Makefile logic for conditional compilation based on INT128 and RocksDB availability.

# Purpose
The `Makefile` content checks for the presence of two conditions: `FD_HAS_INT128` and `FD_HAS_ROCKSDB`. If both conditions are true, it adds the objects `fd_backtest_rocksdb` and `fd_backtest_tile` to the `fd_discof` target. If `FD_HAS_ROCKSDB` is not defined, it issues a warning message indicating that RocksDB is not installed and the backtest will be skipped.
