Makefile logic to add objects for `fd_resolv_tile` and `fd_discof` if `FD_HAS_ALLOCA` and `FD_HAS_INT128`.

# Purpose
The `Makefile` snippet uses conditional directives to determine if certain features are available before adding objects to the build process. If `FD_HAS_ALLOCA` and `FD_HAS_INT128` are defined, the `add-objs` function is called to include `fd_resolv_tile` and `fd_discof` in the build. This ensures that these objects are only included when the necessary features are supported.
