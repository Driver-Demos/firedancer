Includes `fd_resolv_tile.c`, `fd_resolv_tile.h`, `fd_resolv_tile.seccomppolicy`, and Makefile logic with `FD_HAS_ALLOCA` and `FD_HAS_INT128`.

## Folders
- **[generated](generated/README.md)**: Defines a seccomp filter policy for syscall restrictions based on architecture and specific conditions.

## Files
- **[fd_resolv_tile.c](fd_resolv_tile.c.md)**: Implements a transaction resolution tile with blockhash management, transaction stashing, and address lookup table handling.
- **[fd_resolv_tile.h](fd_resolv_tile.h.md)**: Defines a structure for signaling the completion of processing a root bank in the resolv tile.
- **[fd_resolv_tile.seccomppolicy](fd_resolv_tile.seccomppolicy.md)**: Defines security policies for logging, including file descriptor management and log message handling.
- **[Local.mk](Local.mk.md)**: Makefile logic to add objects for `fd_resolv_tile` and `fd_discof` if `FD_HAS_ALLOCA` and `FD_HAS_INT128`.
