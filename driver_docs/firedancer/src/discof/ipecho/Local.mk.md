Makefile rules for building and testing `fd_ipecho` components with optional fuzz testing.

# Purpose
This Makefile script is used to conditionally compile and link object files and tests for a software project. If the `FD_HAS_ALLOCA` flag is defined, it adds object files `fd_ipecho_tile`, `fd_ipecho_client`, and `fd_ipecho_server` to the build using the `fd_discof` library. It also creates a unit test named `test_ipecho_client` with dependencies on several libraries. If the `FD_HAS_HOSTED` flag is also defined, it creates a fuzz test named `fuzz_ipecho_client` with specified dependencies.
