Defines security policies for logging, connection handling, and message transmission in a server-client setup.

# Purpose
The configuration file defines rules for handling file descriptors in a logging and network communication context. It specifies that log messages are written to a file and/or STDERR, with 'WARNING' and above levels being immediately synchronized to disk. The file outlines conditions for closing file descriptors, ensuring that only those opened via sockets are closed, excluding STDERR and the log file. It also sets rules for reading, accepting, sending, and receiving data over network connections, restricting operations on STDERR and the log file. The configuration ensures that network operations are non-blocking and do not signal errors, maintaining efficient and error-free communication.
