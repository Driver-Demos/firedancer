Tests the initialization and termination of the fd_policy module.

# Purpose
The code is a simple C program that includes the header file `fd_policy.h`. It defines a [`main`](<#main>) function that takes command-line arguments `argc` and `argv`. The function `fd_boot` is called with pointers to `argc` and `argv`, which suggests it initializes or configures the program environment. After initialization, the program calls `fd_halt`, which likely terminates or cleans up the program. The code serves as a basic framework for initializing and shutting down a program using the functions provided in the `fd_policy.h` header.
# Imports and Dependencies

Initializes the program with `fd_boot` and then terminates it with `fd_halt`.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The count of command-line arguments passed to the program.
    - `argv`: An array of strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Calls `fd_boot` with pointers to `argc` and `argv` to perform initialization tasks.
    - Calls `fd_halt` to terminate the program.
- **Output**: Returns an integer status code to the operating system, typically indicating successful execution.
