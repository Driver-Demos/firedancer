Defines a seccomp filter policy for syscall control based on architecture and specific syscalls.

# Purpose
The code is a C header file that defines a seccomp (secure computing mode) filter policy for a specific application. It is generated automatically and should not be edited manually. The file includes necessary headers for seccomp and BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter) operations, and it defines architecture-specific constants to ensure compatibility with the runtime environment. The code uses conditional compilation to set the `ARCH_NR` macro based on the target architecture, such as `AUDIT_ARCH_I386`, `AUDIT_ARCH_X86_64`, or `AUDIT_ARCH_AARCH64`.

The main functionality of the code is encapsulated in the [`populate_sock_filter_policy_fd_bank_tile`](<#populate_sock_filter_policy_fd_bank_tile>) function. This function initializes a BPF filter array with 14 instructions that enforce a security policy. The policy checks if the architecture of the executing script matches the runtime architecture and allows or denies specific system calls (`SYS_write` and `SYS_fsync`) based on their arguments. If the conditions are not met, the process is terminated using `SECCOMP_RET_KILL_PROCESS`. The function uses `fd_memcpy` to copy the filter instructions to the output buffer. This header file is intended to be included in other C source files where the seccomp filter policy is required.

### sock\_filter\_policy\_fd\_bank\_tile\_instr\_cnt
- **Type**: `unsigned int`
- **Description**: The `sock_filter_policy_fd_bank_tile_instr_cnt` is a constant unsigned integer that represents the number of instructions in a socket filter policy for a bank tile.
- **Use**: Used to define the expected count of instructions in the `populate_sock_filter_policy_fd_bank_tile` function.

[View Source →](<../../../../../../src/discof/bank/generated/fd_bank_tile_seccomp.h#L26>)

Populates a `sock_filter` array with a predefined seccomp filter policy to control system call permissions.
- **Inputs**:
    - `out_cnt`: The number of elements in the `out` array, which must be at least 14.
    - `out`: A pointer to a `sock_filter` array where the filter policy will be stored.
    - `logfile_fd`: The file descriptor to be allowed for certain system calls.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Check if `out_cnt` is at least 14 using `FD_TEST` macro.
    - Define a `sock_filter` array `filter` with 14 elements to specify the seccomp filter policy.
    - Load the architecture from `seccomp_data` and compare it with `ARCH_NR`; if not equal, jump to `RET_KILL_PROCESS`.
    - Load the syscall number and check if it is `SYS_write` or `SYS_fsync`; if not, jump to `RET_KILL_PROCESS`.
    - For `SYS_write`, check if the first argument is 2 or `logfile_fd`; if not, jump to `RET_KILL_PROCESS`.
    - For `SYS_fsync`, check if the first argument is `logfile_fd`; if not, jump to `RET_KILL_PROCESS`.
    - If none of the conditions are met, execute `RET_KILL_PROCESS`.
    - Copy the `filter` array to the `out` array using `fd_memcpy`.
- **Output**: The `out` array is populated with a seccomp filter policy that allows or denies specific system calls based on predefined conditions.
