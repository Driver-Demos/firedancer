Makefile logic for adding objects to `fd_bank_tile` if `FD_HAS_ATOMIC` and `FD_HAS_INT128` are defined.

# Purpose
The `Makefile` snippet uses conditional directives to manage the inclusion of object files in the build process. If both `FD_HAS_ATOMIC` and `FD_HAS_INT128` are defined, the `add-objs` function is called to add `fd_bank_tile` and `fd_discof` to the list of object files. This ensures that these files are only included when the specified conditions are met, allowing for conditional compilation based on the presence of atomic operations and 128-bit integer support.
