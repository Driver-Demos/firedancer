Defines constants for genesis hash signaling in a blockchain node.

# Purpose
This code is a simple C header file that defines preprocessor macros for signaling different states in a node's lifecycle within a distributed system. The macro `GENESI_SIG_GENESIS_HASH` is set to `0` and indicates that the node is not a bootstrapping node but is publishing a learned genesis hash. The macro `GENESI_SIG_BOOTSTRAP_COMPLETED` is set to `1` and signifies that the node is bootstrapping the chain and should publish the genesis hash along with additional genesis information. The header guards prevent multiple inclusions of this file, ensuring that the macros are defined only once during compilation.
