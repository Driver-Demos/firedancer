Makefile logic for adding objects if FD_HAS_ALLOCA and FD_HAS_INT128 are defined.

# Purpose
The `Makefile` content uses conditional directives to manage the inclusion of object files in the build process. If the macro `FD_HAS_ALLOCA` is defined, it checks if `FD_HAS_INT128` is also defined. If both conditions are true, it calls the `add-objs` function to add the object files `fd_genesi_tile`, `fd_genesis_client`, and `fd_discof` to the build. This setup allows for conditional compilation based on the presence of specific features or capabilities.
