Defines a seccomp filter policy for syscall restrictions based on architecture and specific syscalls.

# Purpose
The code is a C header file that defines a seccomp (secure computing mode) filter policy for a specific application. It is generated automatically and should not be edited manually. The file includes necessary headers for seccomp and BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter) operations, and it defines architecture-specific constants to ensure compatibility with the runtime environment. The code is intended to be used in environments that support seccomp, which is a Linux kernel feature that restricts the system calls a process can make, enhancing security by reducing the attack surface.

The main function, [`populate_sock_filter_policy_fd_send_tile`](<#populate_sock_filter_policy_fd_send_tile>), initializes a BPF filter array with 15 instructions. These instructions define rules for allowing or denying specific system calls based on the architecture and syscall number. The filter allows certain syscalls like `write`, `fsync`, and `getrandom` under specific conditions, while any other syscalls result in the process being killed. The function uses `fd_memcpy` to copy the filter instructions to the output buffer, ensuring that the seccomp policy is correctly applied to the process. The file is part of a larger system that likely uses seccomp to enforce security policies on processes.

# Global Variables

---
### sock\_filter\_policy\_fd\_send\_tile\_instr\_cnt
- **Type**: ``unsigned int``
- **Description**: Defines the number of instructions in the socket filter policy for the `fd_send_tile` operation. This constant is used to ensure that the correct number of instructions are processed in the filter.
- **Use**: Used to verify the instruction count in the `populate_sock_filter_policy_fd_send_tile` function.

[View Source →](<../../../../../../src/discof/send/generated/fd_send_tile_seccomp.h#L26>)

Populates a `sock_filter` array with a predefined seccomp filter policy to control system call permissions.
- **Inputs**:
    - `out_cnt`: The number of elements in the `out` array, which must be at least 15.
    - `out`: A pointer to a `sock_filter` array where the filter policy will be copied.
    - `logfile_fd`: The file descriptor used in the filter policy to allow specific system calls.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Check if `out_cnt` is at least 15 using `FD_TEST` macro.
    - Define a `sock_filter` array `filter` with 15 elements to specify the seccomp filter policy.
    - Load the architecture from `seccomp_data` and compare it with `ARCH_NR`; if not equal, jump to `RET_KILL_PROCESS`.
    - Load the syscall number and check if it matches `SYS_write`, `SYS_fsync`, or `SYS_getrandom`.
    - For `SYS_write`, check if the first argument is 2 or matches `logfile_fd`; allow if true, otherwise jump to `RET_KILL_PROCESS`.
    - For `SYS_fsync`, check if the first argument matches `logfile_fd`; allow if true, otherwise jump to `RET_KILL_PROCESS`.
    - If none of the syscalls match, jump to `RET_KILL_PROCESS`.
    - Copy the `filter` array to the `out` array using `fd_memcpy`.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it modifies the `out` array in place.
