Conditional object file addition for `fd_send_tile` and `fd_discof` based on `FD_HAS_INT128`.

# Purpose
The `Makefile` snippet conditionally adds object files to the build process. If the macro `FD_HAS_INT128` is defined, it calls the function `add-objs` to include `fd_send_tile` and `fd_discof` in the list of object files to compile. This conditional inclusion allows the build process to adapt based on the availability of 128-bit integer support.
