Makefile snippet to build the `fd_discoh` library using a custom `make-lib` function.

# Purpose
The `$(call make-lib,fd_discoh)` line in a Makefile invokes a function named `make-lib` with the argument `fd_discoh`. This function call is typically used to automate the process of building or managing a library named `fd_discoh` within the build system. The `make-lib` function likely contains predefined rules or commands that handle the compilation, linking, or other necessary steps for the library.
