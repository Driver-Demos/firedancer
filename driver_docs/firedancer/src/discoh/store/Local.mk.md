Makefile logic to conditionally add objects `fd_store_tile` and `fd_discoh` if `FD_HAS_ALLOCA` is defined.

# Purpose
The `Makefile` snippet uses a conditional directive to check if the macro `FD_HAS_ALLOCA` is defined. If it is defined, the `add-objs` function is called with the arguments `fd_store_tile` and `fd_discoh`, which likely adds these object files to the build process. This conditional inclusion allows for flexibility in the build configuration based on the presence of the `FD_HAS_ALLOCA` macro.
