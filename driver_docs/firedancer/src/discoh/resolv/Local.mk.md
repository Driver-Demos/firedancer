Makefile logic to conditionally add objects `fd_resolv_tile` and `fd_discoh` if `FD_HAS_ALLOCA` is defined.

# Purpose
The `Makefile` snippet uses a conditional directive to check if the `FD_HAS_ALLOCA` macro is defined. If it is defined, the `add-objs` function is called with `fd_resolv_tile` and `fd_discoh` as arguments, adding these object files to the build process. This configuration controls the inclusion of specific object files based on the presence of the `FD_HAS_ALLOCA` macro.
