Makefile logic to conditionally add objects `fd_poh_tile` and `fd_discoh` if `FD_HAS_ALLOCA` is defined.

# Purpose
The `Makefile` snippet uses a conditional directive to check if the `FD_HAS_ALLOCA` macro is defined. If it is defined, the `add-objs` function is called with the arguments `fd_poh_tile` and `fd_discoh`, which likely adds these object files to the build process. This conditional inclusion allows for flexible compilation based on the presence of the `FD_HAS_ALLOCA` feature.
