Makefile for conditional inclusion of headers and objects based on atomic and int128 support.

# Purpose
The `Makefile` content uses conditional directives to manage the inclusion of headers and object files based on the presence of certain features. If both `FD_HAS_ATOMIC` and `FD_HAS_INT128` are defined, it adds the header file `fd_bank_abi.h` and the object files `fd_bank_abi`, `fd_bank_tile`, and `fd_discoh` to the build process. This ensures that these components are only included when the necessary atomic and 128-bit integer support is available.
