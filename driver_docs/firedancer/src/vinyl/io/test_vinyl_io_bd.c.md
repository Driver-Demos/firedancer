Tests for the `fd_vinyl_io_bd` functionality, including initialization, operations, and error handling.

# Purpose
The code is a C program designed to test the functionality of a vinyl I/O system, specifically focusing on block device (BD) operations. It includes the necessary headers for file operations, error handling, and random number generation. The program initializes the environment and processes command-line arguments to configure parameters such as `--spad-max`, `--path`, and `--seed`. It then sets up a temporary or specified file for testing storage operations. The program tests various aspects of the vinyl I/O system, including construction, accessors, operations, and scratch pad management. It uses assertions to verify the correctness of the operations and logs the progress and results of the tests.

The main components of the program include the initialization of the vinyl I/O system, testing of memory alignment and footprint, and validation of the I/O operations through a series of tests. The program also handles the creation and cleanup of temporary files used for testing. It uses a random number generator to simulate different scenarios and tests the system's ability to handle various conditions, such as invalid stores and misaligned data. The program concludes by cleaning up resources and logging the test results.

Initializes, tests, and validates a vinyl I/O backend using command-line parameters and performs various operations on it.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments.
    - `argv`: An array of command-line arguments.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Calls `fd_boot` to initialize the environment with command-line arguments.
    - Extracts `--spad-max`, `--path`, and `--seed` from the command-line arguments using `fd_env_strip_cmdline_ulong` and `fd_env_strip_cmdline_cstr`.
    - Logs the testing parameters `spad_max` and `seed`.
    - Initializes a random number generator `rng` using `fd_rng_new` and `fd_rng_join`.
    - Determines the storage size `store_sz` based on constants `FD_VINYL_BSTREAM_BLOCK_SZ` and `BCACHE_SZ`.
    - Checks if a path is provided; if not, creates a temporary file for storage using `mkstemp`.
    - Opens the file with the specified path or the temporary file and logs the path used.
    - Truncates the file to `store_sz` using `ftruncate`.
    - Allocates memory `mem` with a maximum size `MEM_MAX` and alignment of 512 bytes.
    - Logs the start of construction testing and checks alignment and footprint using `fd_vinyl_io_bd_align` and `fd_vinyl_io_bd_footprint`.
    - Initializes the vinyl I/O backend with various parameters and tests for invalid initializations using `fd_vinyl_io_bd_init`.
    - Performs tests on the initialized I/O backend using `fd_vinyl_mmio`, `fd_vinyl_mmio_sz`, and accessor functions like `fd_vinyl_io_type`.
    - Calls the [`test`](<test_vinyl_io_common.c.md#test>) function to perform operations on the I/O backend.
    - Tests aborting and resuming the I/O backend using `fd_vinyl_io_fini` and `fd_vinyl_io_bd_init`.
    - Tests scratch pad operations by allocating memory and checking alignment and usage with `fd_vinyl_io_alloc`.
    - Tests destruction by appending a block and finalizing the I/O backend with `fd_vinyl_io_append` and `fd_vinyl_io_fini`.
    - Tests invalid storage conditions by truncating the file to various sizes and attempting to initialize the I/O backend.
    - Cleans up by unlinking the file and deleting the random number generator.
    - Logs the completion of the test and calls `fd_halt` to terminate the program.
- **Output**: Returns 0 to indicate successful execution.
- **Functions Called**:
    - [`test`](<test_vinyl_io_common.c.md#test>)
