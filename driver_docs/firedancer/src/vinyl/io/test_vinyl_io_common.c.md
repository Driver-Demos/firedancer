Tests for the vinyl I/O operations, including append, copy, commit, hint, forget, rewind, sync, and read.

# Purpose
The code is a C module that implements a basic caching mechanism for sequential data operations. It defines a static buffer cache (`bcache`) of size `BCACHE_SZ` and provides several functions to manipulate this cache. The functions include [`bcache_read`](<#bcache_read>) for reading data from the cache, [`bcache_append`](<#bcache_append>) for appending data to the cache, [`bcache_copy`](<#bcache_copy>) for copying data within the cache, [`bcache_commit`](<#bcache_commit>) to commit changes, [`bcache_hint`](<#bcache_hint>) to provide hints about future data operations, [`bcache_forget`](<#bcache_forget>) to forget data up to a certain sequence, [`bcache_rewind`](<#bcache_rewind>) to rewind the cache to a previous state, and [`bcache_sync`](<#bcache_sync>) to synchronize the cache state.

Additionally, the code includes a [`test`](<#test>) function that serves as a test suite for verifying the functionality of the cache operations. It uses random number generation to simulate various operations on the cache and compares the results with expected outcomes using assertions. The test function also interacts with an external interface (`fd_vinyl_io_t`) to ensure that the cache operations are consistent with the expected behavior of the external system. The module is designed to be used internally, as indicated by the use of static functions, and does not define public APIs or external interfaces.
# Global Variables

---
### seq\_ancient
- **Type**: ``ulong``
- **Description**: Stores the oldest sequence number in the buffer cache system. It is used to track the earliest point in the sequence history that is still relevant or needed for operations.
- **Use**: Used to update and manage the sequence history in the buffer cache, particularly during operations like `bcache_rewind` and `bcache_sync`.


---
### seq\_past
- **Type**: `ulong`
- **Description**: `seq_past` is a static unsigned long integer that represents a sequence number in the buffer cache system. It is used to track the past state of the sequence in the buffer cache.
- **Use**: Used to update and manage the past sequence state in the buffer cache operations.


---
### seq\_present
- **Type**: `ulong`
- **Description**: Holds the current sequence number in the buffer cache system. It is updated to match the future sequence number when a commit operation occurs.
- **Use**: Tracks the current state of the sequence in the buffer cache, ensuring data consistency during operations.


---
### seq\_future
- **Type**: ``ulong``
- **Description**: Stores the sequence number for the next operation in the buffer cache. It is used to track the position for appending or copying data in the cache.
- **Use**: Tracks the future sequence number for buffer cache operations.


---
### bcache
- **Type**: ``uchar[]``
- **Description**: An array of unsigned characters (`uchar`) with a size defined by `BCACHE_SZ`. It is used as a buffer cache for storing data temporarily.
- **Use**: Used to store and manage data in a circular buffer for read, append, and copy operations.


# Functions

---
### bcache\_read<!-- {{#callable:bcache_read}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/vinyl/io/test_vinyl_io_common.c#L13>)

Reads data from a circular buffer `bcache` into a destination buffer, handling wrap-around if necessary.
- **Inputs**:
    - `seq0`: The starting sequence number for reading from the `bcache`.
    - `_dst`: A pointer to the destination buffer where data will be copied.
    - `sz`: The number of bytes to read from the `bcache`.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Check if `sz` is zero; if so, return immediately as there is nothing to read.
    - Calculate the offset `off` in the `bcache` using the sequence number `seq0` and the buffer size `BCACHE_SZ`.
    - Determine the number of bytes `rsz` to read in the first `memcpy` operation, which is the minimum of `sz` and the remaining space in the buffer from the offset to the end.
    - Copy `rsz` bytes from `bcache` starting at `off` to the destination buffer `dst`.
    - Subtract `rsz` from `sz` to update the remaining number of bytes to read.
    - If there are still bytes left to read (`sz` is not zero), perform a second `memcpy` to copy the remaining bytes from the start of `bcache` to the destination buffer, handling the wrap-around.
- **Output**: None (the function modifies the destination buffer directly).


---
### bcache\_append<!-- {{#callable:bcache_append}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/vinyl/io/test_vinyl_io_common.c#L26>)

Appends data from a source buffer to a circular buffer and updates the sequence number.
- **Inputs**:
    - `_src`: Pointer to the source data to append to the buffer.
    - `sz`: Size of the data to append, in bytes.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Initialize `seq` with the current `seq_future` value.
    - If `sz` is zero, return `seq` immediately.
    - Update `seq_future` by adding `sz` to it.
    - Calculate the offset `off` in the buffer using `seq` and the buffer size `BCACHE_SZ`.
    - Determine the writable size `wsz` as the minimum of `sz` and the remaining space in the buffer from `off` to the end.
    - Copy `wsz` bytes from `_src` to the buffer starting at `off`.
    - Subtract `wsz` from `sz`.
    - If `sz` is still greater than zero, copy the remaining `sz` bytes from `_src` to the start of the buffer.
    - Return the initial `seq` value.
- **Output**: Returns the initial sequence number before appending the data.


---
### bcache\_copy<!-- {{#callable:bcache_copy}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/vinyl/io/test_vinyl_io_common.c#L42>)

Copies a specified number of bytes from one sequence position to another within a circular buffer.
- **Inputs**:
    - `seq_src0`: The starting sequence position in the buffer from which to copy data.
    - `sz`: The number of bytes to copy from the source position to the destination position.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Initialize `seq` with the current value of `seq_future` and return it if `sz` is zero.
    - Update `seq_future` by adding `sz` to it.
    - Initialize `seq_dst0` with the value of `seq`.
    - Enter a loop to copy data in chunks until `sz` is zero.
    - Calculate `off_src` and `off_dst` as the offsets within the buffer for the source and destination positions, respectively.
    - Determine `csz`, the number of bytes to copy in the current iteration, as the minimum of `sz` and the available space in the buffer from the maximum of `off_src` and `off_dst`.
    - Use `memcpy` to copy `csz` bytes from the source offset to the destination offset within the buffer.
    - Subtract `csz` from `sz` and break the loop if `sz` is zero.
    - Increment `seq_src0` and `seq_dst0` by `csz` to update the source and destination positions for the next iteration.
- **Output**: Returns the initial value of `seq`, which is the starting sequence position for the destination.

### test<!-- {{#callable:test}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/vinyl/io/test_vinyl_io_common.c#L93>)

Performs a series of operations to test the functionality of `fd_vinyl_io_t` against a reference cache implementation.
- **Inputs**:
    - `io`: A pointer to an `fd_vinyl_io_t` structure, which represents the I/O interface to be tested.
    - `rng`: A pointer to an `fd_rng_t` structure, which provides random number generation for the test operations.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Iterates 1,000,000 times, performing a series of tests on the `fd_vinyl_io_t` interface.
    - Verifies that the sequence numbers (`seq_ancient`, `seq_past`, `seq_present`, `seq_future`) match between the `fd_vinyl_io_t` interface and the reference cache.
    - Generates a random number to determine which operation to perform in each iteration.
    - Executes one of several operations (`append`, `copy`, `commit`, `hint`, `forget`, `rewind`, `sync`, or `read`) based on the random number.
    - For each operation, compares the result of the `fd_vinyl_io_t` function with the reference cache function to ensure they match.
    - After the loop, commits and synchronizes both the reference cache and the `fd_vinyl_io_t` interface, verifying that no errors occur.
- **Output**: No output is returned, but the function performs internal tests and assertions to verify the correctness of the `fd_vinyl_io_t` interface.
