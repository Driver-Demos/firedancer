Tests for the `fd_vinyl_io_mm` module, including initialization, accessors, operations, and memory management.

# Purpose
The code is a C program designed to test the functionality of a memory-mapped input/output (I/O) system, specifically for a component referred to as `fd_vinyl_io`. It includes the necessary headers and a common test file, and it defines a [`main`](<#main>) function that initializes the environment, sets up random number generation, and performs a series of tests on the `fd_vinyl_io` system. The program tests various aspects of the I/O system, including its construction, accessors, operations, and memory management capabilities. It uses a series of assertions (`FD_TEST`) to verify that the system behaves as expected under different conditions.

The program begins by initializing the environment and setting parameters such as `spad_max` and `seed` from command-line arguments. It then tests the construction of the `fd_vinyl_io` system by checking alignment and footprint requirements. The program proceeds to test the accessors and operations of the I/O system, including aborting and resuming operations. It also tests the scratch pad memory management by allocating and verifying memory blocks. Finally, the program tests the destruction of the I/O system and handles invalid store scenarios. Throughout the process, the program logs its progress and results using `FD_LOG_NOTICE` and concludes by cleaning up resources and halting the execution.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `../fd_vinyl.h`
- `test_vinyl_io_common.c`


# Global Variables

---
### dev\_sz
- **Type**: ``ulong``
- **Description**: Represents the size of the `dev` array, calculated as the sum of `FD_VINYL_BSTREAM_BLOCK_SZ` and `BCACHE_SZ`. It is a constant value used to define the memory size for the `dev` array.
- **Use**: Used to specify the size of the `dev` array for memory allocation and alignment purposes.


---
### dev
- **Type**: ``uchar[]``
- **Description**: An array of unsigned characters with a size defined by the sum of `FD_VINYL_BSTREAM_BLOCK_SZ` and `BCACHE_SZ`. The array is aligned to `FD_VINYL_BSTREAM_BLOCK_SZ` bytes.
- **Use**: Used as a buffer in the `fd_vinyl_io_mm_init` function to initialize memory-mapped I/O operations.


# Functions

### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/vinyl/io/test_vinyl_io_mm.c#L6>)

Initializes, tests, and validates the functionality of the `fd_vinyl_io` memory management system using command-line parameters for configuration.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments.
    - `argv`: An array of command-line arguments.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Calls `fd_boot` to initialize the environment with command-line arguments.
    - Retrieves `--spad-max` and `--seed` values from the command line using `fd_env_strip_cmdline_ulong`.
    - Logs the testing parameters using `FD_LOG_NOTICE`.
    - Initializes a random number generator `rng` with `fd_rng_new` and `fd_rng_join`.
    - Defines a memory buffer `mem` aligned to 512 bytes for testing purposes.
    - Logs the start of the construction test.
    - Checks alignment and footprint of the memory management system using `fd_vinyl_io_mm_align` and `fd_vinyl_io_mm_footprint`.
    - Performs a series of tests on `fd_vinyl_io_mm_init` with various invalid parameters to ensure robustness.
    - Initializes a valid `fd_vinyl_io_t` object `io` and verifies its creation.
    - Logs the start of accessor tests and validates various properties of `io`.
    - Logs the start of operation tests and calls [`test`](<test_vinyl_io_common.c.md#test>) function with `io` and `rng`.
    - Logs the start of aborting and resuming tests, finalizes `io`, and reinitializes it to test resumption.
    - Validates memory alignment and size using `fd_vinyl_mmio` and `fd_vinyl_mmio_sz`.
    - Logs the start of operation tests after resumption and calls [`test`](<test_vinyl_io_common.c.md#test>) function again.
    - Logs the start of scratch pad tests, commits the `io`, and tests memory allocation and alignment in a loop until `spad_max` is reached.
    - Logs the start of destruction tests, appends a block to `io`, and finalizes it with uncommitted bytes.
    - Logs the start of invalid store tests and attempts to initialize `io` with a bad meta block.
    - Logs the cleanup process, deletes the random number generator, and halts the program.
- **Output**: Returns 0 to indicate successful execution.
- **Functions Called**:
    - [`test`](<test_vinyl_io_common.c.md#test>)
