Makefile for adding headers, objects, and unit tests for the `fd_vinyl_bstream` component.

# Purpose
The Makefile content defines build and test instructions for the `fd_vinyl_bstream` component. It adds the header file `fd_vinyl_bstream.h` and the object files `fd_vinyl_bstream` and `fd_vinyl` to the build process. It also specifies a unit test named `test_vinyl_bstream`, which depends on the `fd_vinyl`, `fd_tango`, and `fd_util` components, and includes a command to execute this unit test.
