Makefile for building and testing the `fd_vinyl` library and its components.

# Purpose
The `Makefile` content defines build and test instructions for the `fd_vinyl` library. It calls a function to create the library, adds headers from `fd_vinyl_base.h`, and includes object files from `fd_vinyl_base` into `fd_vinyl`. It also sets up a unit test named `test_vinyl_base`, which depends on the `fd_vinyl`, `fd_tango`, and `fd_util` libraries, and then runs this unit test.
