Header file for the Vinyl module, including base, IO, and metadata components.

# Purpose
The code is a C header file that manages the inclusion of other header files related to a module named `vinyl`. It uses include guards to prevent multiple inclusions of the same header file, which can cause compilation errors. The file includes `fd_vinyl_base.h`, `fd_vinyl_io.h`, and `fd_vinyl_meta.h`, which are likely to provide base functionalities, input/output operations, and metadata handling for the `vinyl` module. The commented-out line suggests an optional inclusion of `fd_vinyl_bstream.h`, which might be related to stream operations within the module. This header file serves as a central point for including necessary dependencies for the `vinyl` module.
