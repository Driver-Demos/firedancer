Configuration for Clangd with compile flags and warnings for C and C++ files.

# Purpose
The configuration file specifies compile flags for different types of source files in a codebase. It adds general compile flags such as `-D_XOPEN_SOURCE=700` and `-DFD_HAS_ALLOCA=1` to enable specific features and optimizations. For header files with a `.h` extension, it adds the `-xc-header` flag to treat them as C header files. Files with `.h` or `.c` extensions are compiled using the C17 standard, while files with `.hxx` or `.cxx` extensions use the C++17 standard. Additionally, for files with extensions `.h`, `.c`, `.hxx`, or `.cxx`, it includes several warning flags like `-Wall`, `-Wextra`, and `-Wpedantic` to enforce strict code quality and security checks during compilation.
