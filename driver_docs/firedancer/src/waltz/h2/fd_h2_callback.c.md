Implements no-operation callbacks for HTTP/2 connections and streams.

# Purpose
The code defines a set of no-operation (noop) functions for handling HTTP/2 protocol events. These functions are part of a callback mechanism, where each function corresponds to a specific event or operation in an HTTP/2 connection, such as stream creation, connection establishment, and data handling. The functions do not perform any operations; they simply accept parameters and return either `NULL` or perform no action. This is indicated by the use of `(void)` casts on the parameters, which suppresses compiler warnings about unused variables.

The code also defines a constant `fd_h2_callbacks_noop`, which is a structure of type `fd_h2_callbacks_t`. This structure contains pointers to the noop functions, effectively creating a set of default callbacks that perform no actions. The function [`fd_h2_callbacks_init`](<#fd_h2_callbacks_init>) initializes a given `fd_h2_callbacks_t` structure with these noop callbacks. This setup is useful for scenarios where a default, non-functional behavior is required, such as during testing or as a placeholder in a larger system where specific callback implementations are not yet provided.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `fd_h2_callback.h`
- `fd_h2_base.h`


# Global Variables

### fd\_h2\_callbacks\_noop
- **Type**: ``fd_h2_callbacks_t``
- **Description**: Defines a set of no-operation (noop) callback functions for HTTP/2 operations. Each function in the structure is a placeholder that does not perform any action and returns default values or does nothing.
- **Use**: Used to initialize callback structures with no-operation functions for HTTP/2 connections.


# Functions

---
### fd\_h2\_noop\_stream\_create<!-- {{#callable:fd_h2_noop_stream_create}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/waltz/h2/fd_h2_callback.c#L4>)

- **Inputs**:
    - `conn`: A pointer to an `fd_h2_conn_t` structure, representing the connection.
    - `stream_id`: An unsigned integer representing the stream identifier.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Casts `conn` and `stream_id` to void to indicate they are unused.
    - Returns `NULL`, indicating no stream is created.
- **Output**: A null pointer of type `fd_h2_stream_t *`, indicating no stream is created.

- **Inputs**:
    - ``conn``: A pointer to an `fd_h2_conn_t` structure representing the connection.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - The function takes a single argument `conn` and explicitly does nothing with it by casting it to void.
