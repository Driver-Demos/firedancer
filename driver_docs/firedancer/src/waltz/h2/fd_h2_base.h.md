Defines HTTP/2 error codes, related structures, and a function to describe error codes.

# Purpose
This C header file defines configurations, forward declarations, and error codes for an HTTP/2 implementation. It includes a conditional compilation directive to enable or disable socket support based on whether the code is hosted. The file declares several structures (`fd_h2_callbacks`, `fd_h2_rbuf`, `fd_h2_conn`, and `fd_h2_stream`) and their corresponding typedefs for use in the HTTP/2 protocol handling. It also defines a set of HTTP/2 error codes, which are used to identify specific protocol errors, and provides a function prototype [`fd_h2_strerror`](<#fd_h2_strerror>) that returns a string description of these error codes. The header ensures that the declarations and definitions are included only once by using include guards.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `../../util/bits/fd_bits.h`


# Data Structures

---
### fd\_h2\_callbacks\_t
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Description**: `fd_h2_callbacks_t` is a forward declaration of a `struct` named `fd_h2_callbacks`. The actual definition of the `struct` is not provided in the given code, so details about its members or purpose are not available. It is likely used in the context of HTTP/2 operations, as suggested by the surrounding code and naming conventions.


---
### fd\_h2\_rbuf\_t
- **Type**: `typedef struct`
- **Description**: Defines a forward declaration for a structure named `fd_h2_rbuf`, which is aliased to `fd_h2_rbuf_t`. The actual structure definition is not provided in the given code, indicating that it is defined elsewhere. This forward declaration is used to inform the compiler about the existence of the structure, allowing pointers to it to be declared before the full definition is available.


---
### fd\_h2\_conn\_t
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `fd_h2_conn_t`: A typedef for the `struct fd_h2_conn`, representing an HTTP/2 connection.
- **Description**: The `fd_h2_conn_t` is a typedef for a structure that represents an HTTP/2 connection. It is part of a set of forward declarations in the HTTP/2 base header file, which includes other related structures and error codes for handling HTTP/2 protocol operations.


---
### fd\_h2\_stream\_t
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Description**: `fd_h2_stream_t` is a forward declaration of a `struct` named `fd_h2_stream`, which suggests it is part of a larger HTTP/2 implementation. The actual definition of the `struct` is not provided in the given code, so details about its members and functionality are not available in this context.


# Function Declarations (Public API)

---
### fd\_h2\_strerror<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_h2_strerror}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/waltz/h2/fd_h2_base.h#L50>)

Returns a string describing an HTTP/2 error code.
- **Description**: Use this function to obtain a human-readable description of an HTTP/2 error code. It is useful for logging or debugging purposes when you need to understand the nature of an error. The function returns a constant string that describes the error associated with the given error code. If the error code is not recognized, it returns "unknown". This function does not modify any input and has no side effects.
- **Inputs**:
    - `err`: An unsigned integer representing an HTTP/2 error code. Valid values are defined as `FD_H2_ERR_*` constants. If the value does not match any known error code, the function returns "unknown".
- **Output**: A constant string describing the error code. The string is statically allocated and must not be modified or freed by the caller.
- **See Also**: [`fd_h2_strerror`](<fd_h2_proto.c.md#fd_h2_strerror>)  (Implementation)
