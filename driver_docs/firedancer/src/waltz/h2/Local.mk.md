Makefile for building and testing HPACK and HTTP/2 components in the Firedancer codebase.

# Purpose
The Makefile content defines build instructions for components related to HPACK and HTTP/2 protocols. It uses macros to add header files and object files to the build process, such as `fd_hpack.h` and `fd_h2_base.h`, associating them with the `fd_waltz` module. The file includes conditional logic to create fuzz tests for HPACK and HTTP/2 components if the `FD_HAS_HOSTED` variable is defined. Additionally, it specifies unit tests for HTTP/2, such as `test_h2`, and includes instructions to run these tests. The use of macros like `add-hdrs`, `add-objs`, `make-unit-test`, and `run-unit-test` helps organize and automate the build and testing processes for these protocol components.
