Header file for HTTP/2 implementation, including callback, stream, transmission, and HPACK components.

# Purpose
This code is a C header file that manages the inclusion of other header files related to HTTP/2 functionality. It uses include guards to prevent multiple inclusions of the same header file, which can cause compilation errors. The file includes several other headers such as `fd_h2_callback.h`, `fd_h2_stream.h`, `fd_h2_tx.h`, and `fd_hpack.h`, each of which may include additional headers like `fd_h2_base.h`, `fd_h2_proto.h`, and `fd_h2_conn.h`. This structure helps organize and manage dependencies between different components of an HTTP/2 implementation, ensuring that necessary components are available while avoiding redundant inclusions.
