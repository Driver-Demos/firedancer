Implementation of the HTTP/2 framing layer with limitations on HPACK, server push, and priority support.

# Purpose
The directory contains an implementation of the HTTP/2 framing layer, which is responsible for managing the structure and transmission of data frames in HTTP/2 communication. This implementation does not function as a complete HTTP library, as it lacks the full HTTP protocol handling described in RFC 9113 Section 8. The library does not support certain features such as HPACK fragmentation, server push, HTTP/2 priority hints, and the HPACK dynamic table, which may lead to compatibility issues when operating as a server. Additionally, the library does not correctly handle the `END_STREAM` flag in combination with `CONTINUATION` frames. The document also highlights some quirks of the HTTP/2 protocol, such as the ability to send multiple field blocks and the server's capability to initiate streams. The coverage section provides a command sequence for generating code coverage reports using `llvm-cov` and `genhtml`, which are tools for analyzing and visualizing test coverage data.
# Content Summary
This document provides information about a directory containing an implementation of the HTTP/2 framing layer. It is important to note that this is not a complete HTTP library; it only provides the framing layer, excluding the functionalities described in RFC 9113 Section 8.

Key technical details include:

1. **HPACK Fragmentation**: The library assumes that a single header record (HPACK record) is not fragmented across multiple HTTP frames. If fragmentation occurs, it will result in a connection error with the code COMPRESSION_ERROR.

2. **Server Push**: The library does not support HTTP Server Push, as the PUSH_PROMISE feature is disabled via SETTINGS.

3. **Priority**: HTTP/2 priority hints are ignored by this implementation.

4. **HPACK Dynamic Table**: The dynamic table, which provides stateful HTTP header compression, is not supported. This may lead to compatibility issues when operating as a server, particularly due to a race condition between disabling the dynamic table and the client's initial requests.

5. **END_STREAM / CONTINUATION State**: The library does not correctly support the scenario where a HEADERS frame with the END_STREAM flag is followed by CONTINUATION frames on the same stream.

The document also highlights some general quirks of HTTP/2:

- **Header Sequence**: Multiple field blocks, such as headers or trailers, can be sent before data, potentially causing conflicting headers or out-of-band data transmission.

- **Server Requests**: The server can initiate streams, which is separate from server push or regular responses, and is akin to the server sending HTTP requests to the client.

Finally, the document includes a shell script for coverage testing using `clang` and `llvm-cov`. This script compiles the code with coverage instrumentation, runs a fuzz test, and generates a coverage report in lcov format, which is then converted to an HTML report using `genhtml`.
