Tests for HTTP/2 header matching functionality, including sanity checks, queries, and hash collisions.

# Purpose
The code is a C source file that tests the functionality of HTTP/2 header matching and indexing. It includes functions to verify the correct operation of header matching against a predefined set of HTTP/2 headers. The file imports several header files, such as `fd_h2_hdr_match.h`, `fd_hpack.h`, and `fd_hpack_private.h`, which are likely related to HTTP/2 header processing and HPACK, the header compression format used in HTTP/2. The code defines a static function [`check_hpack_idx`](<#check_hpack_idx>) to validate that a given header index corresponds to the expected header name and length.

The main function, [`test_h2_hdr_match`](<#test_h2_hdr_match>), initializes a header matcher and performs various tests to ensure the matcher correctly identifies and handles HTTP/2 headers. It includes tests for sanity checks, header queries, hash collisions, and boundary conditions such as hash map overflow. The code uses assertions to verify expected outcomes and includes conditional compilation for additional tests on Linux systems. The file is intended to be part of a test suite for validating the implementation of HTTP/2 header matching and indexing functionality.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `fd_h2_hdr_match.h`
- `fd_hpack.h`
- `fd_hpack_private.h`
- `unistd.h`
- `stdlib.h`
- `sys/wait.h`
- `sys/syscall.h`


# Functions

---
### check\_hpack\_idx<!-- {{#callable:check_hpack_idx}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/waltz/h2/test_h2_hdr_match.c#L12>)

Validates that the given index corresponds to a predefined HTTP/2 header name and checks if the provided name matches the expected literal for that index.
- **Inputs**:
    - `idx`: An integer representing the index of the HTTP/2 header to check.
    - `name`: A constant character pointer to the name of the HTTP/2 header to validate.
    - `name_idx`: An unsigned long representing the length of the header name to validate.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Uses a switch statement to match the `idx` with predefined HTTP/2 header indices.
    - For each case, uses the macro `FD_TEST` to assert that `name_idx` matches the length of the expected header literal and that `name` matches the expected literal using `fd_memeq`.
    - If `idx` does not match any predefined case, logs an error with `FD_LOG_ERR`.
- **Output**: No return value; the function performs validation and logs an error if the index is invalid.

### test\_h2\_hdr\_match<!-- {{#callable:test_h2_hdr_match}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/waltz/h2/test_h2_hdr_match.c#L79>)

Tests the functionality and robustness of the HTTP/2 header matcher, including initialization, querying, insertion, and handling of hash collisions.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Initialize a header matcher and verify its initialization with [`fd_h2_hdr_matcher_init`](<fd_h2_hdr_match.c.md#fd_h2_hdr_matcher_init>).
    - Perform sanity checks by setting log levels and testing invalid initializations.
    - Set a seed for header matching and iterate over a static table to test header queries using [`fd_h2_hdr_match`](<fd_h2_hdr_match.h.md#fd_h2_hdr_match>).
    - Verify specific header matches and mismatches, including WebSocket headers.
    - Test insertion of headers into the matcher and verify the count of entries.
    - Check for hash collisions by inserting colliding headers and verifying their hash values.
    - Under certain conditions (Linux hosted environment), test failure scenarios using `FD_TEST_FAIL` macro.
    - Fill the hash map to its maximum capacity and test overflow conditions.
    - Finalize the matcher with [`fd_h2_hdr_matcher_fini`](<fd_h2_hdr_match.c.md#fd_h2_hdr_matcher_fini>).
- **Output**: No direct output; the function uses assertions to validate the behavior of the header matcher.
- **Functions Called**:
    - [`fd_h2_hdr_matcher_init`](<fd_h2_hdr_match.c.md#fd_h2_hdr_matcher_init>)
    - [`fd_h2_hdr_match`](<fd_h2_hdr_match.h.md#fd_h2_hdr_match>)
    - [`check_hpack_idx`](<#check_hpack_idx>)
    - [`fd_h2_hdr_matcher_insert`](<fd_h2_hdr_match.c.md#fd_h2_hdr_matcher_insert>)
    - [`fd_h2_hdr_matcher_fini`](<fd_h2_hdr_match.c.md#fd_h2_hdr_matcher_fini>)
