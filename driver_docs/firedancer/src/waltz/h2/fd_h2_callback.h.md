Defines the callback interface for HTTP/2 connection events and provides no-op default implementations.

# Purpose
The `fd_h2_callback.h` file defines a callback interface for handling events in HTTP/2 connections. It provides a structure, `fd_h2_callbacks`, which acts as a virtual function table. This table contains function pointers for various events that can occur during the lifecycle of an HTTP/2 connection, such as stream creation, connection establishment, and data reception. Each function in the table is designed to be implemented by the application using this interface, allowing the application to respond to specific events like incoming headers, data, and connection termination.

The file also includes default no-operation (noop) implementations for each callback function, which can be used as placeholders or defaults if the application does not need to handle certain events. The [`fd_h2_callbacks_init`](<#fd_h2_callbacks_init>) function initializes a `fd_h2_callbacks` structure with these noop functions. This header file is intended to be included in other C source files that require handling of HTTP/2 connection events, providing a standardized way to manage and respond to these events within an application.

Initializes callback functions to no-op defaults.
- **Description**: Use this function to set all callback functions in the provided `fd_h2_callbacks_t` structure to their no-op defaults. This is useful when you want to ensure that all callbacks are defined, even if they do nothing. It is important to call this function before using the `callbacks` structure to avoid undefined behavior due to null pointers. The function must be called with a valid pointer to an `fd_h2_callbacks_t` structure.
- **Inputs**:
    - `callbacks`: A pointer to an `fd_h2_callbacks_t` structure. Must not be null. The function initializes this structure with no-op callback functions.
- **Output**: Returns the pointer to the initialized `fd_h2_callbacks_t` structure.
- **See Also**: [`fd_h2_callbacks_init`](<fd_h2_callback.c.md#fd_h2_callbacks_init>)  (Implementation)
