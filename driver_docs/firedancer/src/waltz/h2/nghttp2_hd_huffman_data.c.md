Huffman coding tables for HTTP/2 header compression in C.

# Purpose
The code defines Huffman coding tables used in the `nghttp2` library, which is a C library for HTTP/2. The file includes two main data structures: `nghttp2_huff_sym` and `nghttp2_huff_decode`. The `nghttp2_huff_sym` array contains Huffman symbols, each represented by a structure with a bit length and a code. This array is used for encoding operations, where input data is converted into a compressed bitstream using Huffman coding. The `nghttp2_huff_decode` table is a multi-dimensional array used for decoding operations. It maps encoded bit sequences back to their original symbols, facilitating the decompression of data encoded with Huffman coding.

The file is part of the internal implementation of the `nghttp2` library and is not intended to define public APIs or external interfaces. It is a generated file, as indicated by the comment "Generated by mkhufftbl.py," suggesting that the tables were created by a script to ensure accuracy and efficiency. The primary purpose of this file is to support the compression and decompression of data streams in the HTTP/2 protocol, which uses Huffman coding to reduce the size of transmitted headers.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `nghttp2_hd_huffman.h`


# Global Variables

---
### huff\_sym\_table
- **Type**: ``const nghttp2_huff_sym[]``
- **Description**: Defines a constant array of `nghttp2_huff_sym` structures, each containing a pair of values: a bit length and a Huffman code. This array is used for Huffman encoding in the nghttp2 library, which is an implementation of the HTTP/2 protocol.
- **Use**: Used to map symbols to their corresponding Huffman codes for efficient data compression in HTTP/2.


---
### huff\_decode\_table
- **Type**: ``nghttp2_huff_decode``
- **Description**: Represents a two-dimensional array of `nghttp2_huff_decode` structures used for Huffman decoding in the HTTP/2 protocol. Each element in the array is a 16-element array of `nghttp2_huff_decode` structures, which contain a code and a symbol value. The table is used to map encoded Huffman values to their corresponding decoded symbols.
- **Use**: Used in the Huffman decoding process to translate encoded data into readable symbols.
