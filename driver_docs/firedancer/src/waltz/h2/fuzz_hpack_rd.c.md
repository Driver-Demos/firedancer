Fuzz testing for HPACK header decoding in the Firedancer project.

# Purpose
The code is a fuzz testing module designed to test the functionality of the HPACK header compression and decompression library, `fd_hpack`. It is structured to work with LLVM's libFuzzer, a coverage-guided fuzzing engine. The module includes two main functions: [`LLVMFuzzerInitialize`](<#llvmfuzzerinitialize>) and [`LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`](<#llvmfuzzertestoneinput>). The [`LLVMFuzzerInitialize`](<#llvmfuzzerinitialize>) function sets up the environment for the fuzzer by configuring logging and initializing the system without signal handlers. It also registers a cleanup function to be called upon program exit.

The [`LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`](<#llvmfuzzertestoneinput>) function is the core of the fuzz testing process. It takes a pointer to input data and its size, then initializes an HPACK reader with this data. The function iterates over the input data, attempting to read headers using the `fd_hpack_rd_next` function. It checks that the reader advances through the data and that buffer pointers remain within valid bounds. The function is designed to identify issues in the HPACK processing by feeding it various inputs, potentially uncovering bugs or vulnerabilities in the library.

# Functions

---
### LLVMFuzzerInitialize<!-- {{#callable:LLVMFuzzerInitialize}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/waltz/h2/fuzz_hpack_rd.c#L11>)

Initializes the fuzzer environment by setting environment variables, booting the system, registering an exit function, and setting the log level.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: A pointer to the argument count, typically passed from the command line.
    - `argv`: A pointer to the argument vector, typically passed from the command line.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Set the environment variable `FD_LOG_BACKTRACE` to `0` to disable backtraces in logs.
    - Call `fd_boot` with `argc` and `argv` to initialize the system.
    - Register `fd_halt` to be called on program exit using `atexit`.
    - Set the core log level to `1` using `fd_log_level_core_set`, which causes the program to crash on an info log.
- **Output**: Returns `0` to indicate successful initialization.

### LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput<!-- {{#callable:LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/waltz/h2/fuzz_hpack_rd.c#L22>)

Processes input data using HPACK decoding and checks for successful header parsing.
- **Inputs**:
    - `data`: A pointer to the input data to be processed.
    - `size`: The size of the input data in bytes.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Initialize an `fd_hpack_rd_t` structure `rd` with the input `data` and `size`.
    - Set `prev` to point to the start of `data`.
    - Enter a loop that continues until `fd_hpack_rd_done(rd)` returns true, indicating all data is processed.
    - In each iteration, declare an `fd_h2_hdr_t` structure `hdr` and a buffer `buf` of 128 bytes.
    - Set `bufp` to point to the start of `buf`.
    - Call `fd_hpack_rd_next(rd, hdr, &bufp, buf+sizeof(buf))` to parse the next header; break the loop if the result is not `FD_H2_SUCCESS`.
    - Assert that `rd->src` has advanced beyond `prev` to ensure progress.
    - Assert that `bufp` remains within the bounds of `buf`.
    - Update `prev` to the current position of `rd->src`.
- **Output**: Returns 0 after processing the input data.
- **Functions Called**:
    - [`fd_hpack_rd_done`](<fd_hpack.h.md#fd_hpack_rd_done>)
    - [`fd_hpack_rd_next`](<fd_hpack.c.md#fd_hpack_rd_next>)
