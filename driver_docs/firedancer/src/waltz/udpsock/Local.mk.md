Makefile for adding headers, objects, and unit tests for UDP socket functionality if hosted.

# Purpose
The `Makefile` snippet uses conditional directives to manage the build process for a project. If the `FD_HAS_HOSTED` variable is defined, it adds the header file `fd_udpsock.h` and the object files `fd_udpsock` and `fd_waltz` to the build. It also sets up a unit test named `test_udpsock_echo`, which depends on `fd_waltz` and `fd_util`.
