Maps OpenSSL SSL error codes to their string representations.

# Purpose
The code is a C source file that provides a utility function for handling OpenSSL error codes. It includes the OpenSSL header `openssl/ssl.h` and checks for the presence of the `FD_HAS_OPENSSL` macro to ensure that OpenSSL is available. If OpenSSL is not available, it generates a preprocessor error. The primary function defined in this file is [`fd_openssl_ssl_strerror`](<#fd_openssl_ssl_strerror>), which takes an integer `ssl_err` as input and returns a constant character string that describes the corresponding OpenSSL error code. The function uses a `switch` statement to map various OpenSSL error codes, such as `SSL_ERROR_NONE`, `SSL_ERROR_SSL`, and others, to their respective string representations. If the error code does not match any known values, the function returns the string "unknown".

This file is intended to be part of a larger codebase that uses OpenSSL for secure communications. It provides a narrow functionality focused on translating OpenSSL error codes into human-readable strings, which can be useful for logging or debugging purposes. The file does not define any public APIs or external interfaces beyond the [`fd_openssl_ssl_strerror`](<#fd_openssl_ssl_strerror>) function, and it is likely intended to be included in other parts of a program that require error handling for OpenSSL operations.

[View Source →](<../../../../../src/waltz/openssl/fd_openssl.c#L9>)

Maps an SSL error code to its corresponding string representation.
- **Inputs**:
    - `ssl_err`: An integer representing the SSL error code to be translated into a string.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Use a switch statement to evaluate the `ssl_err` input.
    - For each case, return the corresponding string representation of the SSL error code.
    - If `ssl_err` does not match any predefined case, return the string "unknown".
- **Output**: A constant character pointer to the string representation of the SSL error code.
