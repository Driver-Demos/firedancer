API for dispatching unary and server-streaming gRPC requests over HTTP/2+TLS with metrics and callbacks.

# Purpose
The `fd_grpc_client.h` file defines an API for managing gRPC client operations over HTTP/2 with TLS. It provides functionality for dispatching unary and server-streaming gRPC requests, handling connection management, and tracking metrics related to gRPC operations. The file includes definitions for structures such as `fd_grpc_client_t` and `fd_grpc_h2_stream_t`, which represent the gRPC client and HTTP/2 stream, respectively. It also defines a set of metrics in `fd_grpc_client_metrics_t` to monitor various aspects of the client's performance, such as connection errors and data transmission statistics.

The file outlines several functions for creating and managing gRPC client instances, such as [`fd_grpc_client_new`](<#fd_grpc_client_new>), [`fd_grpc_client_delete`](<#fd_grpc_client_delete>), and [`fd_grpc_client_reset`](<#fd_grpc_client_reset>). It also provides mechanisms for setting client configurations, including version and authority headers. The API supports both SSL and non-SSL connections, with specific functions for handling I/O operations over SSL ([`fd_grpc_client_rxtx_ossl`](<#fd_grpc_client_rxtx_ossl>)) and TCP sockets ([`fd_grpc_client_rxtx_socket`](<#fd_grpc_client_rxtx_socket>)). Additionally, the file defines a virtual function table `fd_grpc_client_callbacks_t` for application-specific callbacks, allowing users to handle events such as connection establishment, message reception, and request timeouts.

### fd\_grpc\_client\_t
- **Type**: ``fd_grpc_client_t``
- **Members**:
    - ``fd_grpc_client_private``: A private structure that defines the internal details of the gRPC client.
- **Description**: `fd_grpc_client_t` is a typedef for a private structure that represents a gRPC client capable of dispatching unary and server-streaming requests over HTTP/2 with TLS. It abstracts the internal workings of the client, providing an interface for managing gRPC requests, handling connection states, and interacting with callbacks and metrics. The structure is designed to work with a set of defined callbacks and metrics to facilitate communication and error handling in a gRPC environment.

- **Description**: The `fd_grpc_client_metrics` structure holds various counters and metrics related to the operation of a gRPC client. It tracks the number of times the client is polled, errors encountered, data frames sent and received, and the number of active streams. Additionally, it measures the waiting time for incoming and outgoing messages, which can indicate congestion in the server-to-client or client-to-server communication. These metrics help in monitoring and diagnosing the performance and reliability of the gRPC client.

Sets the gRPC client's version string.
- **Description**: Use this function to set the version string for a gRPC client, which is relayed via the user-agent header. The function copies the provided version string into the client object, so the original string can be modified or freed after the call. Ensure that the length of the version string does not exceed the maximum allowed length, as specified by `FD_GRPC_CLIENT_VERSION_LEN_MAX`. If the length is greater, the function logs a warning and does not change the client's version string.
- **Inputs**:
    - `client`: A pointer to an `fd_grpc_client_t` structure. Must not be null, as the function modifies the client's version string.

- **Description**: Use this function to configure the authority header for a gRPC client by specifying a hostname and port number. This function is typically called after initializing the client and before making requests. The hostname is truncated if its length exceeds 255 characters. The function does not retain a reference to the input hostname string, so ensure the string remains valid for the duration of the function call.

Sets a request deadline for a gRPC stream.
- **Description**: Use this function to configure timeouts for a gRPC stream by setting a deadline. The deadline specifies the time by which certain events must occur, such as receiving response headers or completing the response stream. This function must be called with a valid stream and a supported deadline kind. It is important to ensure that the `deadline_kind` is one of the predefined constants, otherwise the application will log an error and abort. This function is typically used to manage time-sensitive operations in gRPC communications.

- **Description**: Use this function to obtain the HTTP/2 connection object linked to a specific gRPC client. This is useful when you need to interact directly with the underlying HTTP/2 connection for advanced operations or diagnostics. Ensure that the `client` parameter is a valid and initialized gRPC client object before calling this function.
- **Inputs**:
    - `client`: A pointer to a `fd_grpc_client_t` object. This must be a valid, non-null pointer to an initialized gRPC client. If the pointer is invalid or null, the behavior is undefined.
