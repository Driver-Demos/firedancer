Makefile for building and testing gRPC components, including unit and fuzz tests, with OpenSSL support.

# Purpose
The content is a Makefile script used to automate the build and testing process for a software project. It defines rules to add header files and object files for components such as `fd_grpc_codec` and `fd_grpc_client`. The script also specifies unit tests for these components, using `make-unit-test` and `run-unit-test` calls to compile and execute tests like `test_grpc_codec` and `test_grpc_client`. Additionally, if the `FD_HAS_HOSTED` variable is defined, the script includes rules to create fuzz tests for components, enhancing the testing coverage by generating random inputs to test the robustness of the code. The use of `$(OPENSSL_LIBS)` indicates that some tests require OpenSSL libraries for execution.
