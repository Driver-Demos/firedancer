Tests HTTP and WebSocket server interactions using requests and websockets libraries.

# Purpose
The code is a script that performs HTTP and WebSocket communication with a server running on `localhost` at port `4321`. It includes three main components: two loops for making HTTP requests and an asynchronous function for WebSocket communication. The first loop sends 50,000 GET requests to the endpoint `/hello/from/the/magic/tavern` and prints the response content. The second loop sends 20 POST requests to the server with a JSON-RPC payload to retrieve account information, then parses and prints the response.

The script also defines an asynchronous function [`hello`](<#hello>), which establishes a WebSocket connection to the server. It sends a JSON-RPC request to subscribe to a service called `slotSubscribe` and continuously receives and prints messages from the server. The script uses the `asyncio` library to run the [`hello`](<#hello>) function until completion. The script concludes by printing 'Test passed!' indicating the end of its execution. This script is intended for testing or interacting with a local server using both HTTP and WebSocket protocols.

Establishes a WebSocket connection to a server and continuously receives and prints JSON-RPC messages.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Sets the WebSocket URI to 'ws://localhost:4321'.
    - Establishes an asynchronous WebSocket connection to the specified URI.
    - Sends a JSON-RPC request with method 'slotSubscribe' to the server.
    - Enters an infinite loop to receive messages from the WebSocket.
    - Receives messages from the WebSocket, parses them as JSON, and prints them with indentation.
- **Output**: No explicit return value; prints received JSON messages to the console.
