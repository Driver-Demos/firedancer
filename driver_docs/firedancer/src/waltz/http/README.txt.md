A copy of the picohttpparser library with a build-time patch for compatibility.

# Purpose
The directory contains a copy of the `picohttpparser` library, specifically from commit `66534e6`. The code from this commit does not compile with the current compilation options, so a small patch is applied during the build process. To update the patch, edit `fd_picohttpparser.c` and generate a new patch file using the `diff` command. Licensing information is available in the `NOTICE` file located in the root of the repository.
