Fuzz testing for URL parsing with boundary checks in the Firedancer codebase.

# Purpose
The code is a fuzz testing module designed to test the parsing functionality of URLs using the LLVM libFuzzer framework. It includes the necessary setup for a fuzzing environment and defines two main functions: [`LLVMFuzzerInitialize`](<#llvmfuzzerinitialize>) and [`LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`](<#llvmfuzzertestoneinput>). The [`LLVMFuzzerInitialize`](<#llvmfuzzerinitialize>) function configures the environment by disabling certain logging features and initializing the system with `fd_boot`. The [`LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`](<#llvmfuzzertestoneinput>) function is the core of the fuzzing process, where it attempts to parse input data as a URL using the `fd_url_parse_cstr` function. If the parsing is successful, it performs bounds checking on various components of the URL (such as scheme, host, port, and tail) to ensure they are within the expected memory bounds.

The module includes a static helper function [`bounds_check`](<#bounds_check>) to verify that the parsed URL components do not exceed the input data's boundaries, which helps in identifying potential buffer overflow vulnerabilities. The code relies on the `fd_url` and `fd_util` libraries, indicating that it is part of a larger system that handles URL parsing and utility functions. The use of assertions in [`bounds_check`](<#bounds_check>) ensures that any violations of expected memory bounds are caught during testing, which is crucial for maintaining the robustness of the URL parsing logic.

### LLVMFuzzerInitialize<!-- {{#callable:LLVMFuzzerInitialize}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/waltz/http/fuzz_url_parse.c#L11>)

Initializes the fuzzer environment by setting environment variables and configuring logging behavior.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: A pointer to the argument count, typically from the command line.
    - `argv`: A pointer to the argument vector, typically from the command line.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Set the environment variable `FD_LOG_BACKTRACE` to `0` to disable backtrace logging.
    - Set the environment variable `FD_LOG_PATH` to an empty string to clear any log path settings.
    - Call `fd_boot` with `argc` and `argv` to perform necessary bootstrapping operations.
    - Set the core log level to `0` using `fd_log_level_core_set`, which causes the program to crash on a debug log.
- **Output**: Returns `0` to indicate successful initialization.

### bounds\_check<!-- {{#callable:bounds_check}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/waltz/http/fuzz_url_parse.c#L22>)

Ensures that a memory region defined by `c1_` and `s1` is within the bounds of another region defined by `c0` and `s0`.
- **Inputs**:
    - `c0`: A pointer to the start of the memory region to check against.
    - `s0`: The size of the memory region to check against.
    - `c1_`: A pointer to the start of the memory region to check.
    - `s1`: The size of the memory region to check.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - If `s1` is zero, return immediately without performing any checks.
    - Cast `c1_` to `uchar const *` and assign it to `c1`.
    - Assert that `s1` is less than or equal to `s0`.
    - Assert that `c1` is greater than or equal to `c0`.
    - Assert that `c1` is less than `c0 + s0`.
    - Assert that `c1 + s1` is less than or equal to `c0 + s0`.
- **Output**: No output is returned, but the function will terminate the program if any assertion fails.

### LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput<!-- {{#callable:LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/waltz/http/fuzz_url_parse.c#L35>)

Parses a URL from input data and performs bounds checking on its components.
- **Inputs**:
    - `data`: A pointer to the input data, which is expected to be a URL in string format.
    - `size`: The size of the input data in bytes.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Declare a `fd_url_t` structure `url_` to store the parsed URL components.
    - Call [`fd_url_parse_cstr`](<fd_url.c.md#fd_url_parse_cstr>) to parse the input data into the `url_` structure.
    - If the URL is successfully parsed, perform bounds checking on the URL's scheme, host, port, and tail components using the [`bounds_check`](<#bounds_check>) function.
- **Output**: Returns 0 after processing the input data.
- **Functions Called**:
    - [`fd_url_parse_cstr`](<fd_url.c.md#fd_url_parse_cstr>)
    - [`bounds_check`](<#bounds_check>)
