Tests for HTTP and WebSocket server interactions using requests and websockets libraries.

# Purpose
The code is a script that interacts with a local server running on port 4321 using both HTTP and WebSocket protocols. It performs two main tasks: making HTTP requests and establishing a WebSocket connection. The script first sends 5000 HTTP GET requests to the endpoint `/hello/from/the/magic/tavern` and prints the response content. It then sends 20 HTTP POST requests to the server with a JSON-RPC payload to retrieve account information, printing the parsed JSON response.

Additionally, the script defines an asynchronous function [`hello`](<#hello>) that connects to the server using a WebSocket. It sends a JSON-RPC request to subscribe to slot updates and continuously receives and prints messages from the server. The script uses the `asyncio` library to run the [`hello`](<#hello>) function until completion. The script concludes by printing 'Test passed!' indicating the end of its execution.

[View Source →](<../../../../../src/waltz/http/test_live_http_server.py#L26>)

Establishes a WebSocket connection to a specified URI and continuously sends and receives JSON-RPC messages.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Defines the WebSocket URI as 'ws://localhost:4321'.
    - Opens an asynchronous WebSocket connection to the specified URI using `websockets.connect`.
    - Sends a JSON-RPC request with method 'slotSubscribe' to the WebSocket server.
    - Enters an infinite loop where it waits for messages from the WebSocket server, decodes them, and prints them in a formatted JSON structure.
- **Output**: No explicit return value; outputs formatted JSON messages to the console.
