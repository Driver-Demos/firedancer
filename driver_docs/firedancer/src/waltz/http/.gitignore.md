Specifies files to ignore in version control for the HTTP component of the Firedancer project.

# Purpose
The file content lists source code files, `picohttpparsertemp.c` and `fd_picohttpparser.c`, which are likely part of a software project. These files are likely related to the implementation of HTTP parsing functionality, as suggested by the naming convention. The files may be used in the build process or for reference in the project structure.
