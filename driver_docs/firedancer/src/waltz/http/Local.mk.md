Applies a local patch to picohttpparser and compiles it, with unit and fuzz tests for HTTP components.

# Purpose
The content is a Makefile script that automates the process of applying a patch to the `picohttpparser` source file and compiling it into an object file. It first copies the original `picohttpparser.c` to a temporary file, applies the patch, and then copies the patched file to `fd_picohttpparser.c`. The script then removes the temporary file. The Makefile also defines dependencies for building the object file `fd_picohttpparser.o` and includes additional headers and objects if the `FD_HAS_HOSTED` condition is met. It further sets up unit tests and fuzz tests for components like `http_server` and `picohttpparser`, ensuring that these components are tested for functionality and robustness.
