Defines the software license as "Apache-2.0".

# Purpose
The code defines a preprocessor macro `FD_LICENSE` with the value `"Apache-2.0"`. This macro is likely used to specify the software license type for the associated source code or project. By defining this macro, the code can programmatically reference the license type, ensuring consistency and ease of maintenance across the codebase. This is a common practice in software projects to manage licensing information efficiently.
