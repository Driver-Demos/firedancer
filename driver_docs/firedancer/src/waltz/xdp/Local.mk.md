Makefile for adding headers, objects, and unit tests for XDP components in the Firedancer project.

# Purpose
The `Makefile` content defines build and test instructions for a software project. It uses conditional statements to check if the `FD_HAS_HOSTED` and `FD_HAS_LINUX` variables are defined. If both conditions are true, it adds header files `fd_xsk.h` and `fd_xdp_redirect_user.h` and object files `fd_xsk`, `fd_xdp1`, `fd_xdp_redirect_user`, and `fd_waltz` to the build process. It also specifies a unit test named `test_xdp_ebpf` that depends on `fd_waltz` and `fd_util`, and includes instructions to run this test.
