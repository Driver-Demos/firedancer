Makefile for building and testing DNS resolution components in the `firedancer` codebase.

# Purpose
The content defines a build configuration for a software project that includes conditional compilation based on the presence of the `FD_HAS_HOSTED` flag. It specifies the inclusion of header files and object files for different components of the project, such as high-level API, configuration, and low-level DNS operations. The `add-hdrs` and `add-objs` functions are used to add headers and object files, respectively, to the build process. Additionally, the configuration sets up unit tests and fuzz tests for various components, using `make-unit-test` and `make-fuzz-test` functions to define the tests and `run-unit-test` to execute them. This setup ensures that the necessary files are compiled and tested as part of the build process when the `FD_HAS_HOSTED` condition is met.
