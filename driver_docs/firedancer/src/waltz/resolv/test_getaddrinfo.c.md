Tests the `fd_getaddrinfo` function by resolving hostnames to IP addresses and printing the results.

# Purpose
The code is an executable C program designed to perform network address resolution for given hostnames. It includes necessary headers for network operations and defines a function [`test_gai`](<#test_gai>) that takes a hostname as input. The function uses `fd_getaddrinfo` to retrieve address information for the specified host and prints the resolved IP addresses. It handles both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, using `inet_ntop` for converting network addresses to a human-readable form. The program uses a static buffer `scratch` for temporary storage during address resolution.

The [`main`](<#main>) function initializes network database file descriptors with `fd_netdb_open_fds` and iterates over command-line arguments, calling [`test_gai`](<#test_gai>) for each hostname provided. The program is intended to be run from the command line, where it will output the resolved IP addresses for each hostname argument. The code relies on external functions such as `fd_getaddrinfo` and `fd_gai_strerror`, which are likely defined in the included `fd_netdb.h` and `fd_ip4.h` headers, indicating that it is part of a larger codebase with custom network utility functions.

# Functions

---
### test\_gai<!-- {{#callable:test_gai}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/waltz/resolv/test_getaddrinfo.c#L10>)

Resolves a hostname to its IP addresses and prints them.
- **Inputs**:
    - `host`: A constant character pointer to the hostname to resolve.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Prints the hostname using `puts`.
    - Initializes a static buffer `scratch` for temporary storage.
    - Calls [`fd_getaddrinfo`](<fd_getaddrinfo.c.md#fd_getaddrinfo>) to resolve the hostname to an address list, storing the result in `res`.
    - Checks if [`fd_getaddrinfo`](<fd_getaddrinfo.c.md#fd_getaddrinfo>) returns an error; if so, prints an error message and returns.
    - Iterates over the linked list of address results in `res`.
    - For each address, checks the address family (`AF_INET` or `AF_INET6`).
    - If `AF_INET`, casts the address to `sockaddr_in` and prints the IPv4 address.
    - If `AF_INET6`, casts the address to `sockaddr_in6`, converts the IPv6 address to a string using `inet_ntop`, and prints it.
    - Continues to the next address in the list by updating `res` to `res->ai_next`.
- **Output**: No return value; outputs the resolved IP addresses to the standard output.
- **Functions Called**:
    - [`fd_getaddrinfo`](<fd_getaddrinfo.c.md#fd_getaddrinfo>)
    - [`fd_gai_strerror`](<fd_getaddrinfo.c.md#fd_gai_strerror>)

### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/waltz/resolv/test_getaddrinfo.c#L42>)

Executes a loop to perform address information retrieval for each command-line argument provided.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The count of command-line arguments passed to the program.
    - `argv`: An array of strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Calls `fd_netdb_open_fds` with `NULL` to initialize network database file descriptors.
    - Iterates over each command-line argument starting from index 1 to `argc - 1`.
    - For each argument, calls the [`test_gai`](<#test_gai>) function with the argument as the host name.
- **Output**: Returns 0 to indicate successful execution.
- **Functions Called**:
    - [`test_gai`](<#test_gai>)
