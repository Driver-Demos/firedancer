Tests the functionality of reading and processing a `resolv.conf` file.

# Purpose
The code is an executable C program designed to test the functionality of reading and processing a `resolv.conf` file. It includes necessary headers and utilities for file descriptor operations and imports a binary resource, `test_resolvconf`, which is a test configuration file. The program uses the `memfd_create` function to create an in-memory file descriptor for the `resolv.conf` file, writes the test data to this file descriptor, and then verifies the correct reading and parsing of the configuration using the `fd_get_resolv_conf` function.

The program performs two main tests: one with a normal `resolv.conf` file and another with the file missing a trailing newline. It uses assertions (`FD_TEST`) to ensure that each step, such as file creation, writing, and reading, is successful. The program logs a notice of "pass" if all tests are successful and then halts execution. This code is part of a test suite to validate the handling of DNS resolver configurations in a controlled environment.

Tests the reading and parsing of a `resolv.conf` file using in-memory file descriptors.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments.
    - `argv`: An array of strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Calls `fd_boot` to initialize the environment with command-line arguments.
    - Creates an in-memory file descriptor `fd_etc_resolv_conf_fd` for `resolv.conf` using `memfd_create`.
    - Writes the contents of `test_resolvconf` to the file descriptor and checks if the write operation was successful.
    - Seeks to the beginning of the file descriptor using `lseek`.
    - Calls [`fd_get_resolv_conf`](<fd_resolvconf.c.md#fd_get_resolv_conf>) to parse the `resolv.conf` data into a `fd_resolvconf_t` structure and checks for success.
    - Closes the file descriptor using `close`.
    - Repeats the above steps after removing the trailing newline from `test_resolvconf`.
    - Logs a notice message indicating the test passed.
    - Calls `fd_halt` to terminate the program.
- **Output**: Returns 0 to indicate successful execution.
- **Functions Called**:
    - [`fd_get_resolv_conf`](<fd_resolvconf.c.md#fd_get_resolv_conf>)
