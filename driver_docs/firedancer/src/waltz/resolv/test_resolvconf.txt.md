Configuration for testing DNS resolution settings.

# Purpose
The configuration file specifies DNS settings for a system. The `nameserver` directive sets the DNS server to `127.0.0.53`, which is typically a local DNS resolver. The `options` directive enables `edns0` for extended DNS options and `trust-ad` to trust DNS responses with the AD (Authenticated Data) flag. The `search` directive specifies the search domain as the root domain, represented by a single dot (`.`).
