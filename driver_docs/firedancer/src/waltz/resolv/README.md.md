Linux userland DNS resolver for WAN servers with modifications for security and compatibility.

# Purpose
The `fd_resolv` module provides a DNS resolver for Linux userland, specifically designed for servers on a Wide Area Network (WAN). It documents system calls and file system accesses to support seccomp and landlock sandboxing, although it is not optimized for performance. This module is a modified version of the `getaddrinfo` implementation from musl libc, imported in May 2025. Modifications include alignment with Firedancer's code style, rewriting in C17 style, and removal of certain features such as pthread cancellation support and malloc calls. The module also replaces internal musl API usages with public libc variants and reuses file descriptors for `/etc/hosts` and `/etc/resolv.conf` to enhance sandboxing.
