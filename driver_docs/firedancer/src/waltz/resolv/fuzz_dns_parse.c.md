Fuzz testing for DNS parsing functionality using LLVM's libFuzzer.

# Purpose
The code is a fuzz testing module designed for use with LLVM's libFuzzer. It initializes a fuzzer environment and tests the robustness of DNS parsing functionality. The [`LLVMFuzzerInitialize`](<#llvmfuzzerinitialize>) function sets up the environment by configuring logging and registering cleanup functions. It disables backtraces and sets the logging level to crash on informational logs. The [`LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`](<#llvmfuzzertestoneinput>) function processes input data to test DNS parsing. It requires at least two bytes of input to proceed, using the first byte to determine the DNS record type (`RR_A` or `RR_AAAA`). The function then initializes a context structure with arrays for addresses and canonical names, and calls `fd_dns_parse` to parse the input data.

The code includes assertions to verify post-conditions, such as ensuring the count of parsed addresses is within valid bounds and that the family of the first address matches the expected type based on the record type. It also checks that any canonical name set is a valid C string. The module relies on external utilities and functions, such as `fd_boot`, `fd_halt`, and `fd_dns_parse`, which are included from other files. This code is intended to be part of a larger system that tests DNS parsing logic for correctness and stability under various input conditions.

# Functions

---
### LLVMFuzzerInitialize<!-- {{#callable:LLVMFuzzerInitialize}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/waltz/resolv/fuzz_dns_parse.c#L8>)

Initializes the fuzzer environment by setting environment variables, booting the system, registering an exit function, and setting the log level.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: A pointer to the argument count, typically from the command line.
    - `argv`: A pointer to the argument vector, typically from the command line.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Set the environment variable `FD_LOG_BACKTRACE` to `0` to disable backtraces in logs.
    - Call `fd_boot` with `argc` and `argv` to initialize the system.
    - Register the `fd_halt` function to be called at program exit using `atexit`.
    - Set the core log level to `1` using `fd_log_level_core_set`, which causes the program to crash on an info log.
- **Output**: Returns `0` to indicate successful initialization.

### LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput<!-- {{#callable:LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/waltz/resolv/fuzz_dns_parse.c#L19>)

Processes input data to parse DNS information and validate the results.
- **Inputs**:
    - `data`: A pointer to an array of unsigned characters representing the input data.
    - `size`: The size of the input data array.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Check if the input size is less than 2; if so, return 0 immediately.
    - Determine the `rrtype` based on the first byte of `data`.
    - Initialize an array of `struct address` and a character array `canon` to zero.
    - Create a `dpc_ctx` structure with initialized values, including `rrtype`.
    - Call [`fd_dns_parse`](<fd_dns_parse.c.md#fd_dns_parse>) with the input data (excluding the first byte), size, a callback function, and the context structure.
    - Verify that the count of addresses in the context is within valid bounds using `FD_TEST`.
    - If there are addresses, check that the family of the first address matches the expected family based on `rrtype`.
    - If `canon` is set, ensure it is a valid C string by checking its length.
- **Output**: Always returns 0.
- **Functions Called**:
    - [`fd_dns_parse`](<fd_dns_parse.c.md#fd_dns_parse>)
