Parses and configures DNS resolver settings from `/etc/resolv.conf` into a `fd_resolvconf_t` structure.

# Purpose
The code defines a function [`fd_get_resolv_conf`](<#fd_get_resolv_conf>) that reads and parses the system's DNS resolver configuration from the `/etc/resolv.conf` file. It initializes a `fd_resolvconf_t` structure with default values for DNS query parameters such as `ndots`, `timeout`, and `attempts`. The function attempts to open and read the resolver configuration file, extracting options like `ndots`, `attempts`, and `timeout` from the "options" line, and collecting nameserver addresses from "nameserver" lines. If the file cannot be accessed or no nameservers are found, it defaults to using the local loopback address `127.0.0.1` as the nameserver.

The function uses several utility functions and macros, such as `fd_io_fgets` for reading lines from the file and `fd_lookup_ipliteral` for interpreting IP addresses. It also handles potential errors during file operations, logging them using `FD_LOG_ERR`. The function is part of a broader system for managing DNS configurations, as indicated by its reliance on external utilities and logging mechanisms. The code is intended to be part of a larger application or library that requires DNS resolution capabilities.

[View Source →](<../../../../../src/waltz/resolv/fd_resolvconf.c#L14>)

Parses the `/etc/resolv.conf` file to configure DNS resolver settings in the `fd_resolvconf_t` structure.
- **Inputs**:
    - `conf`: A pointer to an `fd_resolvconf_t` structure where the function will store the DNS resolver configuration.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Initialize default values for `ndots`, `timeout`, and `attempts` in the `conf` structure.
    - Check if the file descriptor `fd_etc_resolv_conf_fd` is valid; if not, jump to `no_resolv_conf` label.
    - Attempt to seek to the start of the file using `lseek`; log an error if it fails.
    - Initialize a buffered input stream to read from the file descriptor.
    - Read lines from the file using [`fd_io_fgets`](<fd_io_readline.c.md#fd_io_fgets>) until EOF or an error occurs.
    - Ignore lines that do not end with a newline character to avoid misinterpretation.
    - Parse lines starting with 'options' to extract `ndots`, `attempts`, and `timeout` values, updating the `conf` structure with these values if they are valid and within specified limits.
    - Parse lines starting with 'nameserver' to extract IP addresses, storing them in the `conf->ns` array, up to a maximum defined by `MAXNS`.
    - If no nameservers are found, default to using '127.0.0.1' as the nameserver.
    - Set the `nns` field in the `conf` structure to the number of nameservers found.
- **Output**: Returns 0 after processing the resolver configuration.
- **Functions Called**:
    - [`fd_io_fgets`](<fd_io_readline.c.md#fd_io_fgets>)
    - [`fd_io_fgetc`](<fd_io_readline.c.md#fd_io_fgetc>)
    - [`fd_lookup_ipliteral`](<fd_lookup_ipliteral.c.md#fd_lookup_ipliteral>)
