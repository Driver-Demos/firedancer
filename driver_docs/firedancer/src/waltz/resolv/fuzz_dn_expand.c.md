Fuzz testing for the `fd_dn_expand` function using LLVM's libFuzzer framework.

# Purpose
The code is a C source file that implements a fuzz testing interface for a function named [`fd_dn_expand`](<#fd_dn_expand>). The primary purpose of this file is to initialize and execute fuzz tests using the LLVM libFuzzer framework. The [`LLVMFuzzerInitialize`](<#llvmfuzzerinitialize>) function sets up the environment by configuring logging and registering cleanup functions. It modifies the environment variable `FD_LOG_BACKTRACE` to disable backtraces and sets the logging level to crash on informational logs. The `atexit` function registers `fd_halt` to be called upon program termination, ensuring proper cleanup.

The [`LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`](<#llvmfuzzertestoneinput>) function is the core of the fuzz testing process. It takes a data buffer and its size as input, ensuring that the buffer is large enough to contain at least three bytes. The function calculates an offset within the buffer to start the domain name expansion process using [`fd_dn_expand`](<#fd_dn_expand>). It checks the return value of [`fd_dn_expand`](<#fd_dn_expand>) to ensure it is valid and performs additional checks on the resulting string to verify its null-termination and length. The code includes assertions to validate these conditions, which helps identify potential issues during fuzz testing. The file includes headers for utility functions and the `fd_lookup` module, indicating dependencies on external components for logging and initialization.

# Functions

### LLVMFuzzerInitialize<!-- {{#callable:LLVMFuzzerInitialize}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/waltz/resolv/fuzz_dn_expand.c#L15>)

Initializes the fuzzer environment by setting environment variables, booting the system, registering an exit function, and setting the log level.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: A pointer to the argument count, typically passed from the main function.
    - `argv`: A pointer to the argument vector, typically passed from the main function.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Set the environment variable `FD_LOG_BACKTRACE` to `0` to disable backtraces in logs.
    - Call `fd_boot` with `argc` and `argv` to perform system boot operations.
    - Register the `fd_halt` function to be called at program exit using `atexit`.
    - Set the core log level to `1` using `fd_log_level_core_set`, which causes the program to crash on an info log.
- **Output**: Returns `0` to indicate successful initialization.

### LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput<!-- {{#callable:LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/waltz/resolv/fuzz_dn_expand.c#L27>)

Processes input data to expand a domain name starting from a calculated offset and verifies the result.
- **Inputs**:
    - `data`: A pointer to an array of unsigned characters representing the input data.
    - `size`: An unsigned long integer representing the size of the input data array.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Initialize a character array `tmp` with 256 elements set to zero.
    - Check if `size` is less than 3; if true, return -1.
    - Calculate `offset` using the first two bytes of `data` to determine the starting point for expansion, ensuring it does not exceed the buffer size.
    - Call [`fd_dn_expand`](<fd_dn_expand.c.md#fd_dn_expand>) with the calculated `offset` and store the result in `ret`.
    - Verify that `ret` is either -1 or a positive value not exceeding `size`.
    - If `ret` is positive, check that the last character of `tmp` is a null terminator and that the length of `tmp` is less than 256.
- **Output**: Returns 0 if the input is processed successfully, or -1 if the input size is less than 3.
- **Functions Called**:
    - [`fd_dn_expand`](<fd_dn_expand.c.md#fd_dn_expand>)


# Function Declarations (Public API)

### fd\_dn\_expand<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_dn_expand}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/waltz/resolv/fuzz_dn_expand.c#L8>)

Expands a compressed domain name from a DNS message.
- **Description**: Use this function to expand a compressed domain name from a DNS message into a human-readable format. It reads from the source buffer and writes the expanded name to the destination buffer. The function must be called with valid pointers and sufficient space in the destination buffer to store the expanded name. If the source buffer is malformed or the destination buffer is too small, the function returns an error. Ensure that the `src` pointer is within the bounds of the `base` and `end` pointers.
- **Inputs**:
    - `base`: Pointer to the start of the buffer containing the DNS message. Must not be null.
    - `end`: Pointer to the end of the buffer containing the DNS message. Must not be null and must be greater than or equal to `base`.
    - `src`: Pointer to the start of the compressed domain name within the buffer. Must be within the range defined by `base` and `end`.
    - `dest`: Pointer to the buffer where the expanded domain name will be written. Must not be null and must have enough space to store the expanded name.
    - `space`: The size of the destination buffer. Must be greater than zero.
- **Output**: Returns the length of the expanded domain name on success, or -1 on error.
- **See Also**: [`fd_dn_expand`](<fd_dn_expand.c.md#fd_dn_expand>)  (Implementation)
