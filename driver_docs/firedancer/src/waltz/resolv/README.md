- **[fd_dns_parse.c](fd_dns_parse.c.md)**: Parses DNS messages and invokes a callback function for each answer section.
- **[fd_getaddrinfo.c](fd_getaddrinfo.c.md)**: Implements address resolution and error handling functions for network address translation.
- **[fd_io_readline.c](fd_io_readline.c.md)**: Functions for reading lines and characters from a buffered input stream with error handling.
- **[fd_io_readline.h](fd_io_readline.h.md)**: Helper functions for buffered line reads from an input stream, including `fd_io_fgets` and `fd_io_fgetc`.
- **[fd_lookup.h](fd_lookup.h.md)**: Header file for DNS resolution functions and data structures, including address and resolver configurations.
