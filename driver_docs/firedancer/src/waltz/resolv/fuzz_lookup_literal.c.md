Fuzz testing for IP literal lookup functionality with initialization and input handling.

# Purpose
The code is a fuzz testing suite designed to test the function [`fd_lookup_ipliteral`](<#fd_lookup_ipliteral>). It initializes a fuzzing environment using [`LLVMFuzzerInitialize`](<#llvmfuzzerinitialize>), which sets up necessary conditions such as environment variables and logging levels. The function [`LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`](<#llvmfuzzertestoneinput>) is the main entry point for the fuzzing process. It takes an input buffer `data` and its size `size`, and uses this data to simulate various input scenarios for the [`fd_lookup_ipliteral`](<#fd_lookup_ipliteral>) function. The function [`fd_lookup_ipliteral`](<#fd_lookup_ipliteral>) is responsible for resolving a network address from a given name and address family.

The code includes logic to determine the address family based on the first byte of the input data, which can be `AF_UNSPEC`, `AF_INET`, or `AF_INET6`. It then extracts a name from the input data and calls [`fd_lookup_ipliteral`](<#fd_lookup_ipliteral>) with this name and the determined address family. The result of the lookup is checked to ensure that the address family is either `AF_INET` or `AF_INET6` if the lookup is successful. This code is part of a broader testing framework and is not intended to be a standalone executable. It relies on external utilities and functions defined in `fd_util.h` and `fd_lookup.h`.
# Imports and Dependencies

- `../../util/fd_util.h`
- `fd_lookup.h`
- `stdlib.h`


# Functions

---
### LLVMFuzzerInitialize<!-- {{#callable:LLVMFuzzerInitialize}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/waltz/resolv/fuzz_lookup_literal.c#L12>)

Initializes the fuzzer environment by setting environment variables, booting the system, registering an exit function, and setting the log level.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: A pointer to the argument count, typically from the command line.
    - `argv`: A pointer to the argument vector, typically from the command line.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Set the environment variable `FD_LOG_BACKTRACE` to `0` to disable backtracing in logs.
    - Call `fd_boot` with `argc` and `argv` to initialize the system.
    - Register the `fd_halt` function to be called at program exit using `atexit`.
    - Set the core log level to `1` using `fd_log_level_core_set`.
    - Return `0` to indicate successful initialization.
- **Output**: Returns `0` to indicate successful initialization.

### LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput<!-- {{#callable:LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/waltz/resolv/fuzz_lookup_literal.c#L23>)

Processes input data to determine an IP address family and performs a lookup operation.
- **Inputs**:
    - `data`: A pointer to an array of unsigned characters representing the input data.
    - `size`: The size of the input data array.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Initialize a `struct address` variable `addr` and a character array `name` with a size of 4096 bytes.
    - Check if `size` is less than 2; if true, return -1.
    - Extract the first byte of `data` to determine the IP address family using a bitwise AND operation with `0x3u`.
    - Use a switch statement to set `family` to `AF_UNSPEC`, `AF_INET`, or `AF_INET6` based on the value of `family_sel`.
    - Calculate `name_len` as the minimum of `size-1` and `sizeof(name)-1`.
    - Copy `name_len` bytes from `data+1` to `name` and null-terminate `name`.
    - Call [`fd_lookup_ipliteral`](<fd_lookup_ipliteral.c.md#fd_lookup_ipliteral>) with `addr`, `name`, and `family` to perform an IP literal lookup.
    - If the return value `ret` is greater than 0, verify that `addr.family` is either `AF_INET` or `AF_INET6`.
    - Return 0.
- **Output**: Returns 0 if the function completes successfully, or -1 if the input size is less than 2.
- **Functions Called**:
    - [`fd_lookup_ipliteral`](<fd_lookup_ipliteral.c.md#fd_lookup_ipliteral>)


# Function Declarations (Public API)

---
### fd\_lookup\_ipliteral<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_lookup_ipliteral}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/waltz/resolv/fuzz_lookup_literal.c#L7>)

Converts an IP address literal to a structured address.
- **Description**: Use this function to convert a string representation of an IP address into a structured address format. It supports both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. The function requires a buffer to store the resulting address and expects the caller to specify the desired address family. If the address family does not match the provided IP address, the function returns an error code. The function handles scope identifiers for IPv6 addresses, which are necessary for link-local addresses. It returns a positive value on success, zero if the conversion fails, or a specific error code if the address family is incorrect.
- **Inputs**:
    - `buf`: A pointer to a buffer of type `struct address` where the function will store the converted address. Must not be null and must have space for at least one `struct address`.
    - `name`: A null-terminated string representing the IP address to convert. Must not be null.
    - `family`: An integer specifying the address family, either `AF_INET` for IPv4 or `AF_INET6` for IPv6. If the family does not match the IP address type, the function returns an error code.
- **Output**: Returns 1 on successful conversion, 0 if the conversion fails, or a negative error code if the address family is incorrect.
- **See Also**: [`fd_lookup_ipliteral`](<fd_lookup_ipliteral.c.md#fd_lookup_ipliteral>)  (Implementation)
