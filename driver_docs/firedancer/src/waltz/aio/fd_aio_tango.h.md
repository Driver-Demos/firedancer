APIs for submitting and receiving fragments via mcache/dcache pairs, mainly for testing purposes.

# Purpose
The code is a C header file that defines structures and functions for asynchronous input/output (AIO) operations using a memory cache (`mcache`) and data cache (`dcache`). It provides two main APIs: `fd_aio_tango_tx_t` for submitting fragments to an `mcache/dcache` pair and `fd_aio_tango_rx_t` for receiving fragments from an `mcache`. The `fd_aio_tango_tx_t` structure includes fields for managing the transmission of fragments, assuming compact storage and equal depth for `mcache` and `dcache`. The `fd_aio_tango_rx_t` structure is designed for testing purposes, allowing fragment reception without supporting fragmentation or backpressure, and it may overrun fragment pointers during callbacks. The file includes function prototypes for creating and deleting these structures, as well as for polling received fragments.

# Functions

---
### fd\_aio\_tango\_tx\_aio<!-- {{#callable:fd_aio_tango_tx_aio}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/waltz/aio/fd_aio_tango.h#L45>)

Returns a constant pointer to the `fd_aio_t` member of a `fd_aio_tango_tx_t` structure.
- **Inputs**:
    - `self`: A pointer to a constant `fd_aio_tango_tx_t` structure.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Accesses the `aio` member of the `fd_aio_tango_tx_t` structure pointed to by `self`.
    - Returns a constant pointer to the `aio` member.
- **Output**: A constant pointer to the `fd_aio_t` member of the `fd_aio_tango_tx_t` structure.


# Function Declarations (Public API)

---
### fd\_aio\_tango\_tx\_delete<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_aio_tango_tx_delete}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/waltz/aio/fd_aio_tango.h#L42>)

Deletes a transmission context and returns it.
- **Description**: Use this function to delete a transmission context represented by `fd_aio_tango_tx_t`. This function should be called when the transmission context is no longer needed, to ensure proper cleanup of resources. It is important to ensure that the `self` parameter is a valid pointer to an `fd_aio_tango_tx_t` structure before calling this function. The function returns the pointer to the deleted transmission context, allowing for further handling if necessary.
- **Inputs**:
    - `self`: A pointer to an `fd_aio_tango_tx_t` structure representing the transmission context to delete. Must not be null. The caller retains ownership of the memory.
- **Output**: Returns the pointer to the `fd_aio_tango_tx_t` structure that was deleted.
- **See Also**: [`fd_aio_tango_tx_delete`](<fd_aio_tango.c.md#fd_aio_tango_tx_delete>)  (Implementation)


---
### fd\_aio\_tango\_rx\_delete<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_aio_tango_rx_delete}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/waltz/aio/fd_aio_tango.h#L78>)

Deletes a receive context for asynchronous I/O operations.
- **Description**: Use this function to delete a receive context that was previously created for asynchronous I/O operations. This function is typically called when the receive context is no longer needed, allowing for cleanup and resource deallocation. Ensure that the context is not in use when calling this function to avoid undefined behavior.
- **Inputs**:
    - `self`: A pointer to the `fd_aio_tango_rx_t` structure representing the receive context to delete. Must not be null. The caller retains ownership and is responsible for ensuring the context is not in use during deletion.
- **Output**: Returns the pointer to the `fd_aio_tango_rx_t` structure that was passed in, allowing for potential further use or inspection by the caller.
- **See Also**: [`fd_aio_tango_rx_delete`](<fd_aio_tango.c.md#fd_aio_tango_rx_delete>)  (Implementation)


---
### fd\_aio\_tango\_rx\_poll<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_aio_tango_rx_poll}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/waltz/aio/fd_aio_tango.h#L81>)

Polls for fragments from the mcache and sends them to the aio receiver.
- **Description**: Use this function to poll for fragments from the mcache and send them to the aio receiver. It processes up to 64 fragments in a batch. This function does not support fragmentation and does not apply backpressure, meaning fragments are skipped if the aio receiver is too slow. It is mainly intended for testing purposes and does not support high performance. Ensure that the `fd_aio_tango_rx_t` structure is properly initialized before calling this function.
- **Inputs**:
    - `self`: A pointer to an `fd_aio_tango_rx_t` structure. This must be initialized and must not be null. The function will use this structure to access the mcache, depth, base, and aio receiver. Invalid or null pointers will lead to undefined behavior.
- **Output**: None
- **See Also**: [`fd_aio_tango_rx_poll`](<fd_aio_tango.c.md#fd_aio_tango_rx_poll>)  (Implementation)
