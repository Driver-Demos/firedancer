Header file for including utility functions in the Firedancer Waltz module.

# Purpose
This code is a simple C header file that uses include guards to prevent multiple inclusions of its contents. The macro `HEADER_fd_src_waltz_fd_waltz_base_h` is defined to ensure that the file's contents are only included once during compilation. The file includes another header file, `fd_util.h`, which is located in the parent directory's `util` folder. This setup is typically used to manage dependencies and organize code in a modular way.
