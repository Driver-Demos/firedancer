Functions and definitions for QUIC logging, including buffer management, ABI, and high-performance event logging.


## Files
- **[fd_quic_log.c](fd_quic_log.c.md)**: Functions for managing QUIC log buffers, including creation, deletion, and joining for transmission and reception.
- **[fd_quic_log.h](fd_quic_log.h.md)**: ABI definitions and structures for QUIC shared memory logging, including event IDs and error handling.
- **[fd_quic_log_tx.h](fd_quic_log_tx.h.md)**: Internal APIs for high-performance logging of events using a custom binary log format.
- **[fd_quic_log_user.h](fd_quic_log_user.h.md)**: Defines an ABI for extracting high-frequency logs from an `fd_quic` instance without providing log writing APIs.
- **[Local.mk](Local.mk.md)**: Makefile for adding headers and objects, and defining a unit test for QUIC logging.
