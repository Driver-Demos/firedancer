ABI definitions and structures for QUIC shared memory logging, including event IDs and error handling.

# Purpose
The `fd_quic_log.h` file is a C header file that defines the Application Binary Interface (ABI) for logging in a QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections) shared memory (shm) environment. It provides the necessary data structures and constants to facilitate the logging of QUIC-related events and errors. The file includes definitions for structures such as `fd_quic_log_abi_t` and `fd_quic_log_hdr_t`, which contain parameters and headers required for consuming log messages from a QUIC log interface. These structures are essential for managing and interpreting log data related to QUIC connections.

Additionally, the file defines several event identifiers for different types of connection events and allocation failures, such as `FD_QUIC_EVENT_CONN_NEW` for a new connection and `FD_QUIC_EVENT_ALLOC_FAIL_PKT_META` for packet metadata allocation failures. The `fd_quic_log_error_t` structure is also defined to encapsulate error information, including protocol-specific error codes and source file details. This structure helps in identifying and debugging errors that occur during QUIC operations. Overall, the file serves as a crucial component for logging and error handling in a QUIC-based system.
