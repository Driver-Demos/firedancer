Makefile for adding headers and objects, and defining a unit test for QUIC logging.

# Purpose
The `Makefile` content defines build instructions for a software project. It uses the `add-hdrs` function to include header files `fd_quic_log.h` and `fd_quic_log_user.h`. The `add-objs` function adds object files `fd_quic_log` and `fd_quic` to the build process. The line for `make-unit-test` is commented out, indicating that the unit test `test_quic_log` is not currently part of the build process, but it specifies dependencies on `fd_quic` and `fd_util` if uncommented.
