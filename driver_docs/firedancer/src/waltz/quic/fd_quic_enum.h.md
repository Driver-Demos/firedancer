Defines constants and macros for QUIC stream types, error codes, packet types, and configuration parameters.

# Purpose
This C header file defines a collection of macros and constants for use in a QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections) protocol implementation. It includes definitions for stream types, error codes, packet types, and various configuration parameters such as alignment, MTU size, and payload sizes. The file also specifies roles for QUIC entities (client or server) and provides error codes for stream send failures. Additionally, it defines parameters related to packet handling, such as coalescing limits and cryptographic secret sizes. These definitions facilitate the configuration and operation of a QUIC protocol stack by providing standardized values and identifiers.
