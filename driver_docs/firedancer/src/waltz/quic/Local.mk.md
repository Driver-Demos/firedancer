Makefile for building the `fd_quic` library and related binaries with specified headers and objects.

# Purpose
The Makefile content defines the build process for the `fd_quic` library and its associated components. It uses custom functions such as `make-lib`, `add-hdrs`, and `add-objs` to organize the compilation of header files and object files related to the `fd_quic` module. The `add-hdrs` function specifies the header files required for each component, while the `add-objs` function lists the object files to be compiled. Additionally, the conditional block `ifdef FD_HAS_HOSTED` checks if the `FD_HAS_HOSTED` variable is defined, and if so, it compiles the `fd_quic_pcap` binary using the specified dependencies. This structure helps manage dependencies and ensures that the correct files are included during the build process.
