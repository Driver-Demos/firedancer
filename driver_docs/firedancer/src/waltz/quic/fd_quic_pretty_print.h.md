Defines a structure and function for pretty-printing QUIC packet information.

# Purpose
The code is a C header file that defines a structure and a function for handling QUIC packet data. The `fd_quic_pretty_print` structure contains fields for storing IPv4 source and destination addresses and ports, as well as a flow direction indicator and a connection index. The typedef `fd_quic_pretty_print_t` is an alias for this structure. The function [`fd_quic_pretty_print_quic_pkt`](<#fd_quic_pretty_print_quic_pkt>) takes a pointer to a `fd_quic_pretty_print_t` structure, a timestamp, a buffer, and the buffer size as parameters, and it is intended to process or display information about a QUIC packet. The header guards prevent multiple inclusions of this file in a single compilation unit.
# Data Structures

---
### fd\_quic\_pretty\_print
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `ip4_saddr`: Stores the IPv4 source address.
    - `udp_sport`: Stores the IPv4 source port.
    - `ip4_daddr`: Stores the IPv4 destination address.
    - `udp_dport`: Stores the IPv4 destination port.
    - `flow`: Indicates the flow direction, where 0 is ingress and 1 is egress.
    - `conn_idx`: Stores the connection index.
- **Description**: Defines a structure for storing network packet information, including source and destination IP addresses and ports, flow direction, and connection index.

### fd\_quic\_pretty\_print\_t
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `ip4_saddr`: Stores the IPv4 source address.
    - `udp_sport`: Stores the IPv4 source port.
    - `ip4_daddr`: Stores the IPv4 destination address.
    - `udp_dport`: Stores the IPv4 destination port.
    - `flow`: Indicates the flow direction, where 0 is ingress and 1 is egress.

# Function Declarations (Public API)

### fd\_quic\_pretty\_print\_quic\_pkt<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_quic_pretty_print_quic_pkt}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/waltz/quic/fd_quic_pretty_print.h#L14>)

Formats and prints a QUIC packet as a JSON string.
- **Description**: Use this function to convert a QUIC packet into a JSON formatted string for logging or debugging purposes. The function requires a context structure that contains metadata about the packet, such as source and destination IP addresses and ports. The packet data is provided as a buffer with a specified size. The function will print the formatted JSON string to the standard output. If the packet cannot be parsed, the function returns an error code. Ensure the buffer is not null before calling this function.
- **Inputs**:
    - `pkt_ctx`: A pointer to a `fd_quic_pretty_print_t` structure containing metadata about the packet. Must not be null.
    - `now`: A timestamp value, which is ignored by this function.
    - `buf`: A pointer to the buffer containing the QUIC packet data. Must not be null.
    - `buf_sz`: The size of the buffer in bytes. Must be a valid size for the data in `buf`.
- **Output**: Returns a status code indicating success or failure of the parsing operation. Prints the JSON formatted string to standard output.
- **See Also**: [`fd_quic_pretty_print_quic_pkt`](<fd_quic_pretty_print.c.md#fd_quic_pretty_print_quic_pkt>)  (Implementation)
