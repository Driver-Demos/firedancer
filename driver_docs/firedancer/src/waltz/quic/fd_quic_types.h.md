Integer typedefs and a connection ID type definition for QUIC in the Firedancer project.

# Purpose
This C header file defines type aliases for integer types used in the context of QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections) protocol implementation. It uses preprocessor directives to prevent multiple inclusions of the file. The file defines macros that map `uchar`, `ushort`, `uint`, and `ulong` to `fd_quic_uchar`, `fd_quic_ushort`, `fd_quic_uint`, and `fd_quic_ulong`, respectively. Additionally, it defines `FD_QUIC_CONN_ID_TYPE` as an alias for `ulong`, which is likely used to represent connection identifiers in the QUIC protocol.
