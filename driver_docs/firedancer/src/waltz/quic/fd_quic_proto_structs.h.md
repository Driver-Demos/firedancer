Header file for including common QUIC protocol structures and templates in the Firedancer project.

# Purpose
This code is a C header file that uses include guards to prevent multiple inclusions of the same file, which can cause compilation errors. The file includes several other header files: `fd_quic_common.h`, `fd_quic_types.h`, and a series of template headers located in the `templ` directory. These included files likely define common constants, types, and templates used in the QUIC protocol implementation. The purpose of this header file is to aggregate these dependencies, ensuring that any source file including it has access to the necessary definitions and declarations for working with QUIC protocol structures.
