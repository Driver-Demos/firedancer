Tests the QUIC server implementation in the Firedancer codebase.

# Purpose
The code is an executable C program designed to initialize and run a QUIC server. It includes several components and libraries, such as `fd_quic`, `fd_quic_test_helpers`, and `fd_tempo`, which are used to manage QUIC protocol operations, testing utilities, and timing functions, respectively. The program begins by setting up the environment and initializing necessary components, including a random number generator, clock, and workspace for memory management. It then configures and creates a QUIC server instance with specified transport parameters and network settings.

The main functionality of the program is to continuously service the QUIC server and its associated UDP socket, handling incoming and outgoing network traffic. The program uses asynchronous I/O (AIO) for network operations and can optionally capture network traffic using pcap if enabled. The QUIC server is configured with specific transport parameters, such as maximum idle timeout, initial maximum data, and stream limits. The program runs indefinitely, servicing the QUIC server and UDP socket in a loop, and includes cleanup operations to release resources upon termination.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `../fd_quic.h`
- `fd_quic_test_helpers.h`
- `../../../tango/tempo/fd_tempo.h`


# Global Variables

---
### clock
- **Type**: ``fd_clock_t` array`
- **Description**: The `clock` variable is a static array of type `fd_clock_t` with a size of 1. It is used to manage clock-related operations in the program.
- **Use**: Used to initialize and manage clock operations through functions like `fd_clock_default_init`, `fd_clock_now`, `fd_clock_leave`, and `fd_clock_delete`.


---
### clock\_shmem
- **Type**: ``fd_clock_shmem_t` array`
- **Description**: An array of type `fd_clock_shmem_t` with a single element. This array is used to store shared memory information for clock operations.
- **Use**: Used to initialize and manage shared memory for clock operations in the program.


# Functions

### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../../src/waltz/quic/tests/test_quic_server.c#L8>)

Initializes and runs a QUIC server with specified configurations and services network communications indefinitely.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments.
    - `argv`: An array of command-line argument strings.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Calls `fd_boot` and [`fd_quic_test_boot`](<fd_quic_test_helpers.c.md#fd_quic_test_boot>) to initialize the environment.
    - Creates a random number generator using `fd_rng_new` and `fd_rng_join`.
    - Initializes the default clock with `fd_clock_default_init`.
    - Determines the CPU index and adjusts it if it exceeds the shared memory CPU count.
    - Parses command-line arguments for page size, page count, and NUMA index using `fd_env_strip_cmdline_cstr` and `fd_env_strip_cmdline_ulong`.
    - Converts the page size string to a numeric value with `fd_cstr_to_shmem_page_sz` and logs an error if unsupported.
    - Initializes QUIC limits from the environment using `fd_quic_limits_from_env`.
    - Creates an anonymous workspace with `fd_wksp_new_anonymous` and logs its creation.
    - Creates a QUIC server instance with [`fd_quic_new_anonymous`](<fd_quic_test_helpers.c.md#fd_quic_new_anonymous>) and logs its creation.
    - Retrieves the AIO network receive interface with `fd_quic_get_aio_net_rx`.
    - Optionally starts and joins a pcapng session for packet capture if `fd_quic_test_pcap` is enabled.
    - Creates a UDP socket for QUIC with [`fd_quic_udpsock_create`](<fd_quic_test_helpers.c.md#fd_quic_udpsock_create>).
    - Configures QUIC transport parameters and initializes the QUIC configuration from the environment.
    - Sets the AIO network transmit interface with `fd_quic_set_aio_net_tx`.
    - Initializes the QUIC server with `fd_quic_init`.
    - Enters an infinite loop to service QUIC and UDP socket communications using `fd_quic_service` and [`fd_quic_udpsock_service`](<fd_quic_test_helpers.c.md#fd_quic_udpsock_service>).
    - Finalizes the QUIC server with `fd_quic_fini` and cleans up resources.
    - Logs a 'pass' message and halts the test with [`fd_quic_test_halt`](<fd_quic_test_helpers.c.md#fd_quic_test_halt>) and `fd_halt`.
- **Output**: Returns 0 upon successful execution.
- **Functions Called**:
    - [`fd_quic_test_boot`](<fd_quic_test_helpers.c.md#fd_quic_test_boot>)
    - [`fd_quic_new_anonymous`](<fd_quic_test_helpers.c.md#fd_quic_new_anonymous>)
    - [`fd_quic_udpsock_create`](<fd_quic_test_helpers.c.md#fd_quic_udpsock_create>)
    - [`fd_quic_udpsock_service`](<fd_quic_test_helpers.c.md#fd_quic_udpsock_service>)
    - [`fd_quic_udpsock_destroy`](<fd_quic_test_helpers.c.md#fd_quic_udpsock_destroy>)
    - [`fd_quic_test_halt`](<fd_quic_test_helpers.c.md#fd_quic_test_halt>)
