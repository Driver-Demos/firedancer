Fuzz testing for QUIC protocol implementation using LLVM's libFuzzer.

# Purpose
This code is a test suite designed for fuzz testing a QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections) implementation. It includes functions to initialize and destroy a QUIC server instance, send packets, and process input data for fuzz testing. The code uses the `fd_quic` library to handle QUIC protocol operations and includes several headers for QUIC-related functionalities. The [`LLVMFuzzerInitialize`](<#llvmfuzzerinitialize>) function sets up the environment for fuzz testing, including memory allocation and configuration of QUIC server parameters. The [`LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`](<#llvmfuzzertestoneinput>) function processes input data by extracting payload sizes and sending packets to the QUIC server, ensuring that the server can handle various input scenarios.

The code defines a function [`send_packet`](<#send_packet>) that constructs and sends a packet using the QUIC protocol. It encodes IP and UDP headers, calculates checksums, and copies the payload into a buffer before processing the packet with the QUIC server. The [`init_quic`](<#init_quic>) and [`destroy_quic`](<#destroy_quic>) functions manage the lifecycle of the QUIC server, including setting up asynchronous I/O and initializing or finalizing the server. The code is structured to be used with a fuzzing framework, such as LLVM's libFuzzer, to test the robustness of the QUIC implementation against unexpected or malformed inputs.

- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Initialize the QUIC server by calling `init_quic()`.
    - Enter a loop that continues as long as there are more than 2 bytes remaining in the input data.
    - In each iteration, read the next 2 bytes to determine the size of the next packet (`payload_sz`).
    - Advance the data pointer by 2 bytes and decrease the remaining size by 2 bytes.
    - If `payload_sz` is less than or equal to the remaining size, call `send_packet()` to send the packet, then advance the data pointer and decrease the remaining size by `payload_sz`.
    - If `payload_sz` is greater than the remaining size, finalize the QUIC server with `fd_quic_fini()` and exit the loop.
    - Finalize the QUIC server with `fd_quic_fini()` after the loop ends.
