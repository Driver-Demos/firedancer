Encodes binary data in Base64 for text-based transmission or storage, requiring decoding for use.

# Purpose
The code is a binary data block encoded in Base64 format, which is used to convert binary data into a text format suitable for transmission or storage in text-based systems. This encoding is often applied to binary files such as images, documents, or serialized objects, allowing them to be embedded within text-based formats like JSON, XML, or HTML. The code does not define public APIs, external interfaces, or executable logic, and it is not intended to be a script or library file. Instead, it serves as a data representation that requires decoding to retrieve the original binary content for use within an application or system. To utilize the data, a Base64 decoding process must be applied, which is supported by many programming languages and libraries.
