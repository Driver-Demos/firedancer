A Bash script to test parallel transaction transmissions using specified parameters and network namespaces.

# Purpose
This script is a Bash executable that automates the execution of network transactions in parallel. It uses Bash strict mode to ensure robust error handling and sets the internal field separator for safe parsing of input. The script changes the working directory to the script's location and removes temporary files with the prefix `/tmp/run-*`. It reads a specified number of transactions from a transaction file and executes them in parallel using the `parallel` command, with a default of 64 concurrent jobs. Each transaction is processed using the `nsenter` command to enter a network namespace and execute the `fddev txn` command with a base64-encoded payload. The script concludes by reporting the number of successfully transmitted transactions.
# Global Variables

---
### SCRIPT\_DIR
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: `SCRIPT_DIR` is a string variable that stores the absolute path of the directory where the script is located. It uses a combination of shell commands to determine this path by navigating to the directory of the script file and then obtaining the current working directory.
- **Use**: Stores the script's directory path to ensure subsequent commands execute in the correct directory context.


---
### NUM\_TRANSACTIONS
- **Type**: ``integer``
- **Description**: The `NUM_TRANSACTIONS` variable is an integer that specifies the number of transactions to process from the transaction file. It is initialized with a default value of 8102, but can be overridden by a command-line argument.
- **Use**: Controls the number of lines read from the transaction file and processed in parallel.


---
### TX\_FILE
- **Type**: ``string``
- **Description**: The `TX_FILE` variable is a global variable that specifies the file name containing transaction data. It is initialized with a default value of `all.txns`, but can be overridden by a command-line argument.
- **Use**: Specifies the file from which the script reads transaction data to process.


---
### NUM\_JOBS
- **Type**: `integer`
- **Description**: The `NUM_JOBS` variable is an integer that specifies the number of parallel jobs to run. It is set to a default value of 64, but can be overridden by providing a third argument when executing the script.
- **Use**: Controls the number of concurrent processes executed by the `parallel` command.
