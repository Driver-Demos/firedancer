Shell script to test QUIC transactions using a specified transaction file.

# Purpose
This script is a Bash executable that sets up and runs a network namespace test for QUIC transactions. It uses Bash strict mode to ensure robust error handling and sets the internal field separator for handling whitespace. The script navigates to the directory where it is located and removes a temporary log file, `/tmp/test-transactions.log`. It then reads a transaction file, specified by the second command-line argument or defaults to `tx`, and pipes its contents to a test executable, `test_quic_txns`, within a specified network namespace using `nsenter`. The script is intended for testing purposes in a controlled network environment.
# Global Variables

### SCRIPT\_DIR
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: Contains the absolute path of the directory where the script is located. It is determined by changing to the directory of the script's source file and then obtaining the current working directory.
- **Use**: Used to change the current directory to the script's directory at runtime.


---
### TX\_FILE
- **Type**: ``string``
- **Description**: `TX_FILE` is a global variable that stores the name of a file containing transaction data. It is initialized with a default value of 'tx' if no second command-line argument is provided.
