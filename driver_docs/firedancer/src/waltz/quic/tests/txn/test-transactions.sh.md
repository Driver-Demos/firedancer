A Bash script to test transaction transmission using a specified number of transactions and log results.

# Purpose
This script is a Bash executable designed to process and transmit a specified number of transactions from a file. It uses Bash strict mode to ensure robust error handling and sets the internal field separator for safe parsing of input. The script changes the working directory to the location of the script itself and initializes a log file at `/tmp/test-transactions.log`. It reads a specified number of transactions from a given file, defaulting to 1000 transactions from a file named `tx` if not specified. Each transaction is processed and transmitted using the `nsenter` command to execute within a specific network namespace, and the results are logged. The script concludes by reporting the number of transactions successfully transmitted based on specific return codes found in the log file.
# Global Variables

---
### SCRIPT\_DIR
- **Type**: ``SCRIPT_DIR``
- **Description**: Contains the absolute path of the directory where the script is located. It is determined by changing to the directory of the script's source file and then obtaining the current working directory.
- **Use**: Used to change the current directory to the script's directory to ensure subsequent commands execute in the correct context.


---
### NUM\_TRANSACTIONS
- **Type**: ``integer``
- **Description**: Defines the number of transactions to process from the transaction file. It is set to a default value of 1000 if not provided as a command-line argument.
- **Use**: Controls the number of lines read from the transaction file and processed in the script.


---
### TX\_FILE
- **Type**: ``string``
- **Description**: `TX_FILE` is a global variable that stores the name of the file containing transaction data. It defaults to 'tx' if not provided as the second argument to the script.
- **Use**: Used to specify the file from which the script reads a specified number of transaction lines.
