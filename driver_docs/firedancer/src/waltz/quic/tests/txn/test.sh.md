Executes unit tests through Make, ensuring correct build directory selection for the environment.

# Purpose
The `test.sh` script is a Bash script that facilitates the execution of unit tests through the `make` build system. It ensures that the correct build directory is selected based on the current environment variables such as `CC` and `MACHINE`. The script indirectly runs the tests by invoking `make` with the target `run-unit-test`, passing any additional test options provided as arguments. Additionally, it sets the `SHMEM_PATH` variable, defaulting to `/mnt/.fd` if the `FD_SHMEM_PATH` environment variable is not set.
# Global Variables

### SHMEM\_PATH
- **Type**: ``string``
- **Description**: `SHMEM_PATH` is a global variable that stores the path to the shared memory directory. It uses the value of the environment variable `FD_SHMEM_PATH` if it is set; otherwise, it defaults to `/mnt/.fd`. This allows the script to dynamically determine the shared memory path based on the environment configuration.
- **Use**: Used to define the path for shared memory operations in the script.
