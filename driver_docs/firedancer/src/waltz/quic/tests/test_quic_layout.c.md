Tests the size of QUIC frame structures by printing their sizes.

# Purpose
This code is a C program that calculates and prints the sizes of various data structures related to QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections) protocol frames. It includes several header and source files that define the necessary structures and utilities for parsing and handling QUIC frames. The program uses the `printf` function to output the size of each structure, which is determined using the `sizeof` operator. The `FD_TEMPL_DEF_STRUCT_BEGIN` macro is defined to facilitate the printing of structure sizes by iterating over different QUIC frame types. The program includes template files that define and undefine these macros to manage the inclusion of different frame definitions.

Prints the sizes of various QUIC frame structures defined in included templates.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments (unused in this function).
    - `argv`: The array of command-line arguments (unused in this function).
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Ignores the command-line arguments by casting them to void.
    - Prints a newline followed by the header 'frame sizes:'.
    - Defines a macro `FD_TEMPL_DEF_STRUCT_BEGIN` to print the size of a structure with a given name.
    - Includes the template files `fd_quic_dft.h` and `fd_quic_templ.h`, which likely define structures whose sizes are printed using the macro.
    - Includes `fd_quic_undefs.h` to undefine the macro `FD_TEMPL_DEF_STRUCT_BEGIN`.
    - Prints another newline followed by the header 'frame sizes:'.
    - Redefines the macro `FD_TEMPL_DEF_STRUCT_BEGIN` to print the size of a structure with a given name.
    - Includes the template files `fd_quic_dft.h` and `fd_quic_frames_templ.h`, which likely define additional structures whose sizes are printed using the macro.
    - Includes `fd_quic_undefs.h` to undefine the macro `FD_TEMPL_DEF_STRUCT_BEGIN`.
    - Returns 0 to indicate successful execution.
- **Output**: Returns 0 to indicate successful execution.
