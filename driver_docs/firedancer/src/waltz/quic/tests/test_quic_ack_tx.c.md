Tests for QUIC acknowledgment transmission functionality, including packet insertion and frame generation.

# Purpose
The code is a C program designed to test the functionality of QUIC acknowledgment (ACK) packet generation and handling. It includes several header files and a source file related to QUIC protocol operations, indicating that it is part of a larger QUIC implementation. The program initializes an acknowledgment generator and performs a series of tests to verify the correct behavior of ACK packet insertion, handling of packet number ranges, and the generation of ACK frames. It uses assertions to ensure that the state of the acknowledgment generator matches expected values after each operation.

The main technical components include the `fd_quic_ack_gen_t` structure, which manages the state of the acknowledgment queue, and functions such as `fd_quic_ack_gen_init`, `fd_quic_ack_pkt`, and `fd_quic_gen_ack_frames`, which are responsible for initializing the generator, inserting packets into the acknowledgment queue, and generating ACK frames, respectively. The program also tests edge cases such as buffer overflow and incorrect encryption levels. The use of `FD_TEST` macros indicates that the program is structured as a test suite, ensuring that the QUIC acknowledgment logic functions as intended.

Tests the initialization, insertion, overflow, and frame generation of QUIC acknowledgment packets.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments.
    - `argv`: An array of command-line arguments.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Calls `fd_boot` to initialize the environment with command-line arguments.
    - Initializes a `fd_quic_ack_gen_t` structure `gen` using `fd_quic_ack_gen_init`.
    - Verifies the initial state of `gen` with `FD_TEST` assertions.
    - Inserts acknowledgment packets into `gen` using `fd_quic_ack_pkt` and verifies the state after each insertion.
    - Tests the behavior of `fd_quic_ack_pkt` when extending ranges, handling duplicates, and creating gaps.
    - Tests overflow behavior by inserting packets until the queue is full.
    - Generates acknowledgment frames using `fd_quic_gen_ack_frames` and verifies the output buffer and state changes.
    - Decodes acknowledgment frames using `fd_quic_decode_ack_frame` and verifies the decoded values.
    - Logs a success message with `FD_LOG_NOTICE` and halts the program with `fd_halt`.
- **Output**: Returns 0 to indicate successful execution.
