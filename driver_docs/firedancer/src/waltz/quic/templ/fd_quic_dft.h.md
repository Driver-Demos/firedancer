Defines macros for simplifying template structures in the Firedancer QUIC implementation.

# Purpose
This code is a C header file that defines a set of preprocessor macros to simplify the creation of templates. Each macro, such as `FD_TEMPL_DEF_STRUCT_BEGIN` and `FD_TEMPL_DEF_STRUCT_END`, is conditionally defined to ensure that it is only defined if it has not been previously defined. The macros are placeholders that can be used to define elements of a structure, such as `FD_TEMPL_MBR_ELEM`, `FD_TEMPL_MBR_ELEM_VARINT`, and `FD_TEMPL_MBR_ELEM_PKTNUM`, among others. These macros allow for flexible template definitions by providing default implementations that can be overridden as needed. The file is useful for developers who need to create structured data templates with customizable elements.
