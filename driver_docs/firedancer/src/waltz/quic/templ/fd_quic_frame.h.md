Defines QUIC frame types, their attributes, and a function to check frame type allowance for packet types.

# Purpose
The code is a C header file that defines and manages QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections) frame types and their attributes. It provides a macro `FD_QUIC_FRAME_TYPES` that lists various QUIC frame types, each associated with specific attributes such as frame ID, name, and flags indicating the types of packets in which the frame is allowed. The flags include indicators for Initial, Handshake, 0-RTT, and 1-RTT packets, as well as whether the frame is not ACK eliciting. The file also defines constants and an array `fd_quic_frame_type_flags` to store these attributes for each frame type.

The header file includes a function [`fd_quic_frame_type_allowed`](<#fd_quic_frame_type_allowed>), which checks if a given frame type is allowed for a specified packet type. This function uses the `fd_quic_frame_type_flags` array to determine the validity of the frame type for the packet type, returning 1 if allowed and 0 otherwise. The file is intended to be included in other C source files that require information about QUIC frame types and their usage constraints, providing a structured way to handle frame type validation in QUIC protocol implementations.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `../../../util/fd_util_base.h`
- `../fd_quic_enum.h`


# Global Variables

---
### fd\_quic\_frame\_type\_flags
- **Type**: ``uchar const``
- **Description**: An array of constant unsigned characters that is aligned to a 32-byte boundary. The array size is defined by `FD_QUIC_FRAME_TYPE_CNT`, which represents the number of QUIC frame types.
- **Use**: Stores flags for each QUIC frame type to indicate which packet types the frame is allowed in.


# Functions

---
### fd\_quic\_frame\_type\_allowed<!-- {{#callable:fd_quic_frame_type_allowed}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../../src/waltz/quic/templ/fd_quic_frame.h#L67>)

Determines if a given QUIC frame type is allowed for a specified packet type.
- **Inputs**:
    - `pkt_type`: An unsigned integer representing the packet type, which must be one of `FD_QUIC_PKT_TYPE_{INITIAL, HANDSHAKE, ZERO_RTT, ONE_RTT}`.
    - `frame_type`: An unsigned integer representing the frame type to check against the packet type.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Check if `pkt_type` is greater than 4; if true, return 0 indicating the frame type is not allowed.
    - Check if `frame_type` is greater than or equal to `FD_QUIC_FRAME_TYPE_CNT`; if true, return 0 indicating the frame type is not allowed.
    - Return the result of the bitwise AND operation between `fd_quic_frame_type_flags[frame_type]` and `(1u<<pkt_type)`, converted to a boolean value, indicating if the frame type is allowed.
- **Output**: Returns 1 if the frame type is allowed for the given packet type, otherwise returns 0.
