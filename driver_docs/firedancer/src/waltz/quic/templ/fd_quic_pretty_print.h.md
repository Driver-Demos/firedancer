Macros for pretty-printing QUIC structures in a formatted and traceable manner.

# Purpose
The code provides a set of macros for generating functions that perform pretty-printing of data structures related to QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections) protocol. The primary functionality is to format and output the contents of these structures in a human-readable form, likely for debugging or logging purposes. The macros define how to begin and end the pretty-printing function for a given structure, and they specify how to format different types of data elements within the structure, such as integers and arrays.

The code includes macros like `FD_TEMPL_DEF_STRUCT_BEGIN` and `FD_TEMPL_DEF_STRUCT_END` to define the start and end of a pretty-print function for a specific structure. It uses `pretty_print` to format individual elements, with specific macros for different data types and formats, such as `FD_TEMPL_MBR_ELEM`, `FD_TEMPL_MBR_ELEM_VAR`, and `FD_TEMPL_MBR_ELEM_ARRAY`. These macros handle various data types and formats, including unsigned integers and hexadecimal representations. The code is intended to be included in other C files, as indicated by the inclusion of `fd_quic_dft.h`, and it does not define a standalone executable or public API.
