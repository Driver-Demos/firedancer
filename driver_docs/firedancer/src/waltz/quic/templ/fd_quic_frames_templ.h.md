Defines structures for various QUIC frames, including PADDING, PING, ACK, and others, with specific formats.

# Purpose
The code defines a series of data structures that represent different types of frames used in a network protocol. Each frame type is defined using a macro-based template system, which specifies the frame's type identifier and its constituent fields. The frames include `padding_frame`, `ping_frame`, `ack_frame`, `reset_stream_frame`, `stop_sending_frame`, `crypto_frame`, `new_token_frame`, `stream_frame`, `max_data_frame`, `max_stream_data_frame`, `max_streams_frame`, `data_blocked_frame`, `stream_data_blocked_frame`, `streams_blocked_frame`, `new_conn_id_frame`, `retire_conn_id_frame`, `path_challenge_frame`, `path_response_frame`, `conn_close_frame`, and `handshake_done_frame`. Each frame is associated with a specific type identifier, and the fields within each frame are defined using macros that specify the data type and constraints.

The code is structured to facilitate the definition of frames in a consistent manner, using macros such as `FD_TEMPL_DEF_STRUCT_BEGIN` and `FD_TEMPL_DEF_STRUCT_END` to encapsulate the frame definitions. The frames are designed to handle various aspects of network communication, such as connection management, data transmission, and error handling. The use of macros allows for a flexible and scalable approach to defining frame structures, which can be easily extended or modified as needed. The frames are likely intended to be used in a network protocol implementation, where they serve as the building blocks for encoding and decoding protocol messages.
