Undefines template macros related to QUIC structure definitions and frame contexts.

# Purpose
This code is a C preprocessor directive file that undefines a series of macros. These macros, such as `FD_TEMPL_DEF_STRUCT_BEGIN` and `FD_TEMPL_MBR_ELEM`, are likely used in other parts of the codebase to define or manipulate data structures and their elements. By undefining these macros, the file ensures that any previous definitions are removed, which can prevent conflicts or redefinitions in subsequent code. This is typically done to maintain a clean preprocessor environment or to prepare for redefining these macros with different values or behaviors later in the code.
