Defines a macro for handling QUIC frames with a customizable context and data structure.

# Purpose
This code is a C header file that defines a macro for creating function prototypes related to handling QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections) frames. It first checks if `FD_TEMPL_FRAME_CTX` is defined; if not, it defines it as `void`. The macro `FD_TEMPL_DEF_STRUCT_BEGIN(NAME)` is then defined to generate a static function prototype named `fd_quic_handle_##NAME`. This function takes a pointer to `FD_TEMPL_FRAME_CTX`, a pointer to a data structure `fd_quic_##NAME##_t`, a constant pointer to an unsigned character array `p`, and an unsigned long `p_sz`. The file includes another header file, `fd_quic_dft.h`, which likely contains additional definitions or declarations related to QUIC.
