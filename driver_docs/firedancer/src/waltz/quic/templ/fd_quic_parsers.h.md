Macros for parsing QUIC protocol data structures with support for various data types and error handling.

# Purpose
The code defines a set of macros for parsing QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections) protocol data. These macros are designed to extract and decode various data types from a byte buffer, such as `uchar`, `ushort`, `uint`, and `ulong`. The macros perform bitwise operations to shift and combine bytes into the desired data type. The code also includes macros for parsing more complex structures, such as packet numbers and variable-length integers, which are specific to the QUIC protocol.

The code provides a framework for defining functions that decode QUIC protocol structures. It uses macros like `FD_TEMPL_DEF_STRUCT_BEGIN` and `FD_TEMPL_DEF_STRUCT_END` to encapsulate the decoding logic within a function. The macros handle different types of data elements, including fixed-size elements, variable-length integers, and raw byte arrays. The code checks for buffer overflows and returns a failure code if the input data is insufficient. The inclusion of `fd_quic_dft.h` suggests that additional definitions or implementations related to QUIC parsing are provided in that header file.
