Template macros for defining and structuring QUIC-related data structures in the Firedancer codebase.

# Purpose
This code is a C header file template that defines macros for generating structures related to QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections) protocol data handling. The macros, such as `FD_TEMPL_DEF_STRUCT_BEGIN` and `FD_TEMPL_DEF_STRUCT_END`, are used to define the beginning and end of a structure, respectively. Other macros like `FD_TEMPL_MBR_ELEM`, `FD_TEMPL_MBR_ELEM_HIDDEN`, and `FD_TEMPL_MBR_ELEM_VARINT` define different types of structure members, including standard elements, hidden elements, and variable-length integers. The macro `FD_TEMPL_MBR_ELEM_PKTNUM` is specifically for handling packet numbers, which are encrypted and require special handling. The file concludes with an inclusion of another header file, `fd_quic_dft.h`, which likely contains default settings or additional definitions related to the QUIC protocol.
