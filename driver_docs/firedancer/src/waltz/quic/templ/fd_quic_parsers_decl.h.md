Declarations for `fd_quic_decode_*` functions to decode QUIC packets and frames.

# Purpose
The code is a C header file that declares a macro `FD_TEMPL_DEF_STRUCT_BEGIN` for defining functions to decode QUIC packets and frames. The macro generates function declarations for `fd_quic_decode_*` functions, where `*` is replaced by a specific name. Each function takes a pointer to a structure `fd_quic_##NAME##_t`, a byte array `buf`, and its size `sz` as input parameters. The function returns the number of bytes consumed during the decoding process and requires the caller to check the result. The file includes another header file, `fd_quic_dft.h`, which likely contains additional definitions or implementations related to QUIC decoding.
