Macros for calculating maximum encoding sizes of QUIC frames at compile time using struct definitions.

# Purpose
The code defines a set of macros to calculate the maximum encoding sizes for QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections) frames at compile time. It constructs structures with character arrays to determine the sizes of different frame components, which eliminates the need for packed structures. The macro `FD_QUIC_MAX_FOOTPRINT` calculates the maximum footprint for a given frame by using the `sizeof` operator on a specific structure. Other macros, such as `FD_TEMPL_ENCODE_FP`, `FD_TEMPL_MBR_FRAME_TYPE`, and `FD_TEMPL_MBR_ELEM`, define the encoding footprint for various elements, including frame types, packet numbers, and variable-length integers. The code includes a header file `fd_quic_dft.h`, which likely contains additional definitions or dependencies related to QUIC encoding.
