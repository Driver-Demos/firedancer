Macros for defining and printing QUIC structure data in various formats.

# Purpose
This code is a C header file that defines a set of macros for generating functions to print the contents of structures related to QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections) protocol data. The macros, such as `FD_TEMPL_DEF_STRUCT_BEGIN` and `FD_TEMPL_DEF_STRUCT_END`, are used to define the start and end of a function that prints the fields of a structure. Other macros like `FD_TEMPL_MBR_ELEM`, `FD_TEMPL_MBR_ELEM_VAR`, and `FD_TEMPL_MBR_ELEM_RAW` are used to format and print different types of data fields within these structures, including fixed-size elements, variable-length elements, and raw byte arrays. The file includes format specifiers for different data types, such as `FD_QUIC_FMT_uchar` and `FD_QUIC_HEX_FMT_ulong`, to ensure the correct formatting of output. The inclusion of `fd_quic_dft.h` suggests that this file relies on additional definitions or declarations provided in that header.
