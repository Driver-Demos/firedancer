Defines a macro for beginning a static inline function to dump QUIC structure declarations.

# Purpose
The code defines a macro `FD_TEMPL_DEF_STRUCT_BEGIN` that generates a function prototype for dumping the contents of a structure related to QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections). The macro takes a parameter `NAME` and constructs a function named `fd_quic_dump_struct_##NAME`, which is intended to take a pointer to a constant structure of type `fd_quic_##NAME##_t`. The inclusion of the header file `fd_quic_dft.h` suggests that this file is part of a larger system dealing with QUIC protocol data structures, and the macro is used to facilitate the creation of functions for debugging or logging purposes.
