Defines a macro for generating pretty-print functions for QUIC structures.

# Purpose
The code defines a macro `FD_TEMPL_DEF_STRUCT_BEGIN` that generates a function prototype for pretty-printing a structure associated with QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections). The macro takes a parameter `NAME` and constructs a function named `fd_quic_pretty_print_struct_##NAME`, which is intended to print the contents of a structure of type `fd_quic_##NAME##_t`. The function is declared as `static inline`, indicating that it is defined in a header file and should be inlined by the compiler. The inclusion of the header file `fd_quic_dft.h` suggests that this file is part of a larger codebase related to QUIC protocol handling, where `fd_quic_dft.h` likely contains additional definitions or declarations used in conjunction with this macro.
