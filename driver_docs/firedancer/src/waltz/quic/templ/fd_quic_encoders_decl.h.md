Defines macros for QUIC encoders and their footprint calculations.

# Purpose
This code defines macros for encoding operations related to QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections) frames. The macro `FD_TEMPL_DEF_STRUCT_BEGIN(NAME)` generates two inline function declarations for a given `NAME`. The first function, `fd_quic_encode_##NAME`, encodes a QUIC frame of type `fd_quic_##NAME##_t` into a buffer, while the second function, `fd_quic_encode_footprint_##NAME`, calculates the footprint of the frame. The inclusion of the header file `fd_quic_dft.h` suggests that it contains default definitions or additional utilities related to QUIC encoding. This code is part of a template system to facilitate the creation of encoding functions for different QUIC frame types.
