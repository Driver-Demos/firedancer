Macros and inline functions for encoding QUIC frames with error handling and buffer management.

# Purpose
The code is a C header file that provides macros for encoding various data types and structures in the context of QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections) protocol operations. The primary functionality of the code is to define a series of macros that facilitate the encoding of different data types such as `uchar`, `ushort`, `uint`, and `ulong` into a byte buffer. These macros are used to convert values into a byte-oriented format suitable for network transmission, adhering to the QUIC protocol's requirements.

The code includes macros for encoding specific elements within a QUIC frame, such as frame types, packet numbers, and variable-length integers. It also provides mechanisms to handle variable-length fields and raw byte arrays, ensuring that the encoded data fits within the specified buffer size. The macros are designed to be used in conjunction with a structure definition, allowing for the encoding of complex data structures into a byte stream. The file includes a reference to `fd_quic_dft.h`, suggesting that it is part of a larger library or framework for handling QUIC protocol operations. The code also includes error handling for buffer overflows and encoding failures, returning specific error codes when such conditions are detected.
