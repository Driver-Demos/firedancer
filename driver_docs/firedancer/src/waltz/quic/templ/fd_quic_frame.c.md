Defines lookup tables and frame handlers for QUIC frame types and metrics in the Firedancer codebase.

# Purpose
The code defines a set of utilities for handling QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections) frame types. It includes lookup tables and frame handlers that are essential for interpreting and processing different QUIC frame types. The `fd_quic_frame_type_flags` array is a lookup table that maps each frame type to its corresponding flags, which are defined using macros. Similarly, the `fd_quic_frame_metric_id` array maps each frame type to a metric ID, facilitating the identification and processing of frames based on their metrics.

The code also includes a macro `FD_TEMPL_DEF_STRUCT_BEGIN` that generates functions to interpret (decode and handle) specific frame types. These functions use the `fd_quic_decode_##NAME` and `fd_quic_handle_##NAME` functions to decode the frame from a buffer and handle it accordingly. The code is structured to be included in other files, as indicated by the use of include guards and the inclusion of other header files like `fd_quic_frame.h`, `fd_quic_dft.h`, `fd_quic_frames_templ.h`, and `fd_quic_undefs.h`. This suggests that the code is part of a larger library or framework for handling QUIC protocol operations.
# Imports and Dependencies

- `fd_quic_frame.h`
- `fd_quic_dft.h`
- `fd_quic_frames_templ.h`
- `fd_quic_undefs.h`


# Global Variables

---
### fd\_quic\_frame\_metric\_id
- **Type**: ``uchar const``
- **Description**: An array of unsigned characters that is aligned to a 32-byte boundary. It serves as a lookup table for frame metric IDs, where each index corresponds to a frame type and contains the metric ID for that frame type.
- **Use**: Used to map frame types to their corresponding metric IDs in the QUIC protocol implementation.
