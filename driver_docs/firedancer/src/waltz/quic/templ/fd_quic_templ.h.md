Defines data structures for various QUIC packet types and transport parameters.

# Purpose
The code defines a series of data structures that represent various packet formats and transport parameters used in network communication protocols. These structures are defined using a template-like syntax, which suggests that they are part of a larger framework or library for handling network packets. The structures include `long_hdr`, `version_neg`, `initial`, `handshake`, `retry_hdr`, `one_rtt`, `transport_param_entry`, `common_frag`, `ack_range_frag`, `ecn_counts_frag`, and `preferred_address`. Each structure corresponds to a specific type of packet or parameter, such as long header packets, version negotiation packets, initial packets, handshake packets, retry packets, and 1-RTT packets, as well as transport parameters and fragments related to acknowledgment and ECN counts.

The code is organized to define the fields of each packet or parameter, including fixed fields like version numbers and variable-length fields like connection IDs and payloads. The use of macros like `FD_TEMPL_DEF_STRUCT_BEGIN` and `FD_TEMPL_MBR_ELEM` indicates a structured approach to defining these data types, which likely facilitates serialization and deserialization of packet data. The structures are designed to handle various aspects of packet headers, including connection identifiers, packet numbers, and payloads, as well as transport parameters such as preferred addresses and reset tokens. This code is likely part of a library that provides functionality for constructing, parsing, and managing network packets in a protocol-compliant manner.
