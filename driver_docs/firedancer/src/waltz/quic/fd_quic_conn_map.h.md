Defines a structure and macros for a QUIC connection map with dynamic mapping capabilities.

# Purpose
This C header file defines a data structure and related macros for managing a map of QUIC connections. The `fd_quic_conn_map` structure, aligned to 16 bytes, contains a `conn_id` of type `ulong` and a pointer `conn` to a `fd_quic_conn_t` structure. The typedef `fd_quic_conn_map_t` is provided for ease of use. The file also sets up several macros, such as `MAP_NAME`, `MAP_T`, and `MAP_KEY`, which are used to configure a dynamic map implementation included from `fd_map_dynamic.c`. The map uses `conn_id` as the key and a simple hash function `MAP_KEY_HASH` that casts the key to a `uint`.
# Imports and Dependencies

- `../../util/tmpl/fd_map_dynamic.c`


# Data Structures

---
### fd\_quic\_conn\_map
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - ``conn_id``: A unique identifier for a connection.
    - ``conn``: A pointer to an `fd_quic_conn_t` structure representing the connection.
- **Description**: Aligns to 16 bytes and maps a connection ID to a pointer to an `fd_quic_conn_t` structure, facilitating the management of QUIC connections.

- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - ``conn_id``: A unique identifier for a connection.
    - ``conn``: A pointer to a `fd_quic_conn_t` structure representing the connection.
- **Description**: Aligns to 16 bytes and maps a connection ID to a pointer to a QUIC connection structure, facilitating efficient connection management.
