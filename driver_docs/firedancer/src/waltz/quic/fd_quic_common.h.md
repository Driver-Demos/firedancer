Defines data structures and constants for QUIC protocol handling in the Firedancer project.

# Purpose
This C header file defines constants, type declarations, and a structure related to the QUIC protocol. It includes a utility header file `fd_util_base.h` and defines constants `FD_QUIC_PARSE_FAIL` and `FD_QUIC_ENCODE_FAIL` to represent failure conditions using the maximum value of an unsigned long. The file specifies a maximum of 8 supported versions for QUIC version packets with `FD_QUIC_MAX_VERSIONS`. It provides forward declarations for several structures related to QUIC, such as `fd_quic_t`, `fd_quic_conn_t`, and others, which are likely used in the implementation of the QUIC protocol. Additionally, it defines a structure `fd_quic_range` with two unsigned long members, `offset_lo` and `offset_hi`, to represent a range, which is aligned to 16 bytes and can be used to manage data offsets within the protocol.
# Imports and Dependencies

- `../../util/fd_util_base.h`


# Data Structures

---
### fd\_quic\_t
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `fd_quic_t`: A forward declaration for a `struct` representing a QUIC protocol instance.
    - `fd_quic_conn_t`: A forward declaration for a `struct` representing a QUIC connection.
- **Description**: The `fd_quic_t` and `fd_quic_conn_t` are forward declarations for structures related to the QUIC protocol, which is used for secure and reliable internet communication. These declarations suggest that the actual definitions of these structures are located elsewhere in the codebase, and they are likely used to manage QUIC protocol instances and connections.


---
### fd\_quic\_conn\_t
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `fd_quic_conn_t`: A forward declaration for a `struct` representing a QUIC connection.
- **Description**: `fd_quic_conn_t` is a forward declaration for a `struct` that represents a QUIC connection in the Fast Data (FD) QUIC implementation. The actual definition of the `struct` is not provided in the given code, indicating that it is defined elsewhere. This `struct` is part of a larger set of data structures used to manage QUIC protocol operations.


---
### fd\_quic\_config\_t
- **Type**: ``fd_quic_config_t``
- **Description**: `fd_quic_config_t` is a forward declaration of a structure used in the QUIC protocol implementation. The actual definition of this structure is not provided in the given code, so its members and specific purpose within the QUIC configuration context are not detailed here.


---
### fd\_quic\_tls\_cfg\_t
- **Type**: ``fd_quic_tls_cfg_t``
- **Description**: `fd_quic_tls_cfg_t` is a forward declaration of a structure type, which means its definition is not provided in the given code. It is likely used to configure TLS (Transport Layer Security) settings for QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections) protocol operations. The actual members and their descriptions are not available in the provided code.


---
### fd\_quic\_tls\_t
- **Type**: ``fd_quic_tls_t``
- **Description**: `fd_quic_tls_t` is a forward declaration of a structure in the QUIC protocol implementation. The actual definition of the structure is not provided in the given code, so its members and functionality are not specified here.


---
### fd\_quic\_tls\_hs\_t
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Description**: `fd_quic_tls_hs_t` is a forward declaration of a `struct` in the code, indicating that it is a placeholder for a data structure that will be defined elsewhere in the program.


---
### fd\_quic\_tls\_secret\_t
- **Type**: ``fd_quic_tls_secret_t``
- **Description**: `fd_quic_tls_secret_t` is a forward declaration of a structure in the code, indicating that it is defined elsewhere. The structure is likely related to handling TLS secrets in the context of QUIC protocol operations, but the specific fields and their purposes are not provided in the given code.


---
### fd\_quic\_tls\_hs\_data\_t
- **Type**: ``fd_quic_tls_hs_data_t``
- **Description**: `fd_quic_tls_hs_data_t` is a forward declaration of a structure in the code provided. The actual definition of the structure is not present in the given code, so details about its members and functionality are not available. It is likely used in the context of QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections) protocol handling, specifically related to TLS (Transport Layer Security) handshake data.


---
### fd\_quic\_pkt\_t
- **Type**: ``fd_quic_pkt_t``
- **Description**: `fd_quic_pkt_t` is a forward declaration of a structure in the QUIC protocol implementation, but its definition is not provided in the given code. It is likely used to represent a QUIC packet within the context of the QUIC protocol operations.


---
### fd\_quic\_state\_t
- **Type**: ``fd_quic_state_t``
- **Description**: `fd_quic_state_t` is a forward declaration for a structure named `fd_quic_state_private`, which is not defined in the provided code. This suggests that `fd_quic_state_t` is used as a placeholder for a more complex data structure that is defined elsewhere in the codebase.


---
### fd\_quic\_range
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `offset_lo`: The lower bound of the range, inclusive.
    - `offset_hi`: The upper bound of the range, exclusive.
- **Description**: Defines a range with a lower bound `offset_lo` and an upper bound `offset_hi`, where the range includes all offsets from `offset_lo` up to, but not including, `offset_hi`. A zero-initialized range is empty, represented as [0,0).


---
### fd\_quic\_range\_t
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `offset_lo`: The lower bound of the range, inclusive.
    - `offset_hi`: The upper bound of the range, exclusive.
- **Description**: Defines a range with a lower bound `offset_lo` and an upper bound `offset_hi`, where the range includes all offsets from `offset_lo` to `offset_hi` (exclusive). A zero-initialized range is empty, represented as [0,0).
