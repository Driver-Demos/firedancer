Makefile for building and testing TLS components, including unit and fuzz tests, with optional OpenSSL support.

# Purpose
The `Makefile` content automates the build process for a software project involving TLS (Transport Layer Security) components. It uses custom functions to manage the compilation and testing of the `fd_tls` library and its associated headers and object files. The `make-lib` function compiles the `fd_tls` library, while `add-hdrs` and `add-objs` functions include the necessary header and object files. The file also defines unit tests and fuzz tests for the TLS components, using `make-unit-test` and `make-fuzz-test` functions, which are conditional on the presence of certain features like `FD_HAS_HOSTED` and `FD_HAS_OPENSSL`. The `run-unit-test` function executes the defined unit tests, ensuring the integrity and functionality of the TLS components within the project.
