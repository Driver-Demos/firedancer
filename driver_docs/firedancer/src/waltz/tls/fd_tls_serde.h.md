Branch-minimizing (de-)serializer macros for internal use in `fd_tls_proto.c`.

# Purpose
The `fd_tls_serde.h` file provides a set of macros for serialization and deserialization operations, specifically designed for internal use within the `fd_tls_proto.c` file. These macros are intended to minimize branching and perform bounds checking during the serialization and deserialization processes. The file defines a series of macros such as `FD_TLS_SERDE_BEGIN`, `FD_TLS_SERDE_END`, `FD_TLS_SERDE_LOCATE`, `FD_TLS_SERDE_CHECK`, `FD_TLS_SERDE_DECODE`, and `FD_TLS_SERDE_ENCODE`, which collectively manage the context and execution of these operations. The macros handle tasks like locating fields, checking bounds, and performing memory operations with potential byte-swapping for data types.

Additionally, the file includes convenience macros for common operations, such as `FD_TLS_DECODE_FIELD` and `FD_TLS_ENCODE_FIELD`, which simplify the process of decoding and encoding single fields. It also provides batch processing macros like `FD_TLS_DECODE_STATIC_BATCH` and `FD_TLS_ENCODE_STATIC_BATCH` for handling multiple fields at once. The file includes mechanisms for handling lists and skipping fields, as seen in `FD_TLS_DECODE_LIST_BEGIN`, `FD_TLS_DECODE_LIST_END`, `FD_TLS_SKIP_FIELD`, and `FD_TLS_SKIP_FIELDS`. These macros ensure that the operations are performed efficiently and safely, with error handling for out-of-bounds conditions. The file is not intended for use outside of its specific context, as indicated by the comment that it should not be included elsewhere.
