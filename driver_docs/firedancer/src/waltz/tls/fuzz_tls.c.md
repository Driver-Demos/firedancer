Fuzz testing implementation for TLS handshaking in the Firedancer codebase.

# Purpose
The code is a fuzz testing suite for the `fd_tls` handshaking process. It is designed to test the robustness and correctness of the TLS handshake implementation by providing random inputs and observing the behavior of the system. The code includes functions to simulate various aspects of a TLS handshake, such as handling secrets, sending messages, and managing QUIC transport parameters. It uses a template `fd_tls_t` structure to configure the handshake parameters and state, and it initializes a random number generator to create random keys and certificates for testing purposes.

The [`LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`](<#llvmfuzzertestoneinput>) function is the main entry point for the fuzzing process. It takes a byte array as input, interprets the first few bytes as a state configuration, and uses the remaining bytes as the payload for the handshake. The function supports both server and client handshake scenarios, and it checks the validity of the handshake state before proceeding. The code also includes initialization and cleanup functions to set up the environment and manage resources during the fuzzing process. The use of mock certificates and random data generation helps to simulate a wide range of handshake scenarios, making it possible to identify potential issues in the TLS implementation.

# Global Variables

---
### tls\_tmpl
- **Type**: ``fd_tls_t` array`
- **Description**: Defines a static array of type `fd_tls_t` with a single element, initialized with function pointers and ALPN protocol information. The array is used to set up a template for TLS operations, including handling secrets, sending messages, and managing QUIC transport parameters.
- **Use**: Used as a template for initializing and configuring TLS operations in the fuzzing test.


---
### \_tls\_valid\_srv\_hs\_state
- **Type**: ``uchar` array`
- **Description**: Defines a static array of unsigned characters with 16 elements, where specific indices corresponding to server handshake states are set to 1. These indices represent valid states in the TLS handshake process for a server.
- **Use**: Used to validate server handshake states during the TLS handshake process.


---
### \_tls\_valid\_cli\_hs\_state
- **Type**: ``uchar` array`
- **Description**: An array of unsigned characters that represents valid client handshake states in a TLS (Transport Layer Security) protocol. Each index in the array corresponds to a specific handshake state, and a value of 1 indicates that the state is valid for a client during the handshake process.
- **Use**: Used to verify if a given client handshake state is valid during the TLS handshake process.
