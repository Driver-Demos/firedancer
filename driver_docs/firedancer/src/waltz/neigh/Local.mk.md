Makefile for adding headers, objects, and unit tests related to `fd_neigh4` in the `firedancer` project.

# Purpose
The `Makefile` content defines build instructions for a software project. It uses the `add-hdrs` and `add-objs` functions to include header files and object files, respectively, such as `fd_neigh4_map.h` and `fd_neigh4_map`. The conditional block `ifdef FD_HAS_LINUX` checks if the `FD_HAS_LINUX` variable is defined, and if so, it adds additional headers and objects related to `fd_neigh4_netlink` and `fd_neigh4_probe`. It also specifies a unit test target `test_neigh4_netlink` that depends on `fd_waltz` and `fd_util`.
