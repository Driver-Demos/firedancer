Functions for printing IPv4 and MAC address mappings from a neighbor map to a file.

# Purpose
The code is part of a C source file that implements functionality for handling and printing entries in an IPv4 neighbor map. It includes necessary headers and definitions for working with the `fd_neigh4_map` data structure, which is used to manage mappings between IPv4 addresses and Ethernet MAC addresses. The file includes a function [`fd_neigh4_hmap_fprintf`](<#fd_neigh4_hmap_fprintf>), which iterates over the entries in the neighbor map and prints each valid entry's IPv4 address and corresponding MAC address to a specified file stream. This function is designed to work in a hosted environment, as indicated by the `FD_HAS_HOSTED` preprocessor directive.

The function [`fd_neigh4_hmap_fprintf`](<#fd_neigh4_hmap_fprintf>) uses several utility functions and macros to interact with the neighbor map, such as `fd_neigh4_hmap_ele_max`, `fd_neigh4_hmap_shele_const`, and `fd_neigh4_hmap_query_try`. It performs speculative reads and checks for read overruns to ensure data integrity. The function outputs the formatted IPv4 and MAC addresses using the `fprintf` function, and it handles potential errors by returning the appropriate error code. This code is intended to be part of a larger system that manages network neighbor information, providing a mechanism to output the current state of the neighbor map for diagnostic or logging purposes.

### fd\_neigh4\_hmap\_fprintf<!-- {{#callable:fd_neigh4_hmap_fprintf}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/waltz/neigh/fd_neigh4_map.c#L16>)

Prints the IP and MAC address entries from a hash map to a specified file.
- **Inputs**:
    - ``map``: A pointer to a `fd_neigh4_hmap_t` structure representing the hash map containing IP and MAC address entries.
    - ``file_``: A pointer to a `FILE` object where the function will print the IP and MAC address entries.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Initialize `file` as a `FILE` pointer from `file_`.
    - Retrieve the maximum number of elements (`ele_max`) and a pointer to the elements (`ele`) from the hash map using `fd_neigh4_hmap_ele_max` and `fd_neigh4_hmap_shele_const`.
    - Iterate over each element in the hash map up to `ele_max`.
    - For each element, retrieve the IP address (`ip4_addr`) and perform a speculative read using `fd_neigh4_hmap_query_try`.
    - If the speculative read is unsuccessful, continue to the next element.
    - Copy the queried element data into a local variable `e` using `memcpy`.
    - Check if the read was overrun using `fd_neigh4_hmap_query_test`; if so, continue to the next element.
    - If the IP address in `e` is non-zero, print the IP and MAC address to the file using `fprintf`.
    - If `fprintf` fails, return the error number `errno`.
    - Return 0 upon successful completion of the loop.
- **Output**: Returns 0 on success or an error number if `fprintf` fails.
