Defines macros for a hash map with specific types and a hash function for IPv4 addresses.

# Purpose
This code defines a set of macros for configuring a hash map in C. The macro `MAP_NAME` specifies the name of the hash map as `fd_neigh4_hmap`. The macro `MAP_ELE_T` defines the type of elements stored in the map as `fd_neigh4_entry_t`. The macro `MAP_KEY_T` sets the type of the key used in the map as `uint`, and `MAP_KEY` specifies the key field within the element as `ip4_addr`. The macro `MAP_KEY_HASH` provides a hashing function for the key, which combines the dereferenced key value with a seed using the `fd_uint_hash` function. These macros are likely used to configure a generic hash map implementation.
