Macros for eBPF assembly instruction encoding and register definitions.

# Purpose
This code is a C header file that defines macros for assembling eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter) instructions. It provides symbolic names for eBPF registers (`FD_EBPF_ASM_r0` to `FD_EBPF_ASM_r5`) and macros to construct eBPF instructions for various operations, such as load, arithmetic, and jump instructions. The macros like `FD_EBPF_ASM_ldxb`, `FD_EBPF_ASM_mov64_imm`, and `FD_EBPF_ASM_jeq_imm` simplify the creation of eBPF bytecode by encoding operation codes, destination and source registers, immediate values, and offsets into a single instruction. The file uses preprocessor directives to prevent multiple inclusions and ensure that the macros are only defined once.
