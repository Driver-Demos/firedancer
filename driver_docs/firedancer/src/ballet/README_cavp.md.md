Contains unmodified NIST CAVP test vectors for SHA-2 hash functions with verification checksums.

# Purpose
The document provides information about the NIST Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Program (CAVP) and includes test vectors for validating implementations of NIST-recommended cryptographic algorithms. It contains unmodified copies of test vectors for the SHA-2 family of hash functions, such as SHA-256 and SHA-512, as specified in FIPS 180-4. The document lists the SHA-256 checksums for each test vector file to verify their integrity. It also provides links to the source of the test vectors and additional documentation for usage, such as the Secure Hash Algorithm Validation System (SHAVS). The table included specifies the file names, their locations, and their corresponding SHA-256 checksums.
