Implements base58 encoding and decoding with AVX optimizations and lookup tables for character mapping.

# Purpose
The code provides functionality for encoding and decoding data using the Base58 encoding scheme. Base58 is a binary-to-text encoding scheme that is commonly used in applications such as Bitcoin addresses. The code includes definitions and lookup tables necessary for converting between binary data and Base58-encoded strings. It supports both standard and AVX (Advanced Vector Extensions) optimized operations, as indicated by the conditional inclusion of `fd_base58_avx.h` when AVX is available.

The code defines several constants and lookup tables, such as `base58_chars` and `base58_inverse`, which map between Base58 characters and their corresponding values. It also includes encoding and decoding tables (`enc_table_32`, `dec_table_32`, `enc_table_64`, and `dec_table_64`) that facilitate the conversion process for different data sizes. The inclusion of `fd_base58_tmpl.c` suggests that the code is part of a larger system where template-based code generation is used to handle different data sizes or configurations. The code is structured to allow for efficient, branchless lookups and operations, which is important for performance in encoding and decoding tasks.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `fd_base58.h`
- `fd_base58_avx.h`
- `fd_base58_tmpl.c`


# Global Variables

---
### base58\_chars
- **Type**: ``char const[]``
- **Description**: Maps the indices [0, 58) to the corresponding Base58 characters. The array contains the characters used in Base58 encoding, excluding characters that can be easily confused, such as '0', 'O', 'I', and 'l'.
- **Use**: Used to convert numerical values to their Base58 encoded string representation.


---
### base58\_inverse
- **Type**: ``uchar const[]``
- **Description**: Maps the difference between a character value and '1' to a range of [0, 58). Invalid base58 characters map to `BASE58_INVALID_CHAR`, and the character after 'z' also maps to `BASE58_INVALID_CHAR` to allow branchless lookups.
- **Use**: Used to convert base58 characters to their corresponding numerical values.


---
### enc\_table\_32
- **Type**: ``uint const``
- **Description**: Contains unique values less than 58^5, used in base58 encoding calculations. The table is structured to map powers of 2 to sums of powers of 58.
- **Use**: Used in base58 encoding to map binary data to base58 characters.


---
### dec\_table\_32
- **Type**: ``uint const``
- **Description**: Contains unique values less than 2^32 that are used in calculations involving powers of 58 and 2. The table is structured with dimensions defined by `INTERMEDIATE_SZ` and `BINARY_SZ`, which are related to the encoding and decoding processes of base58.
- **Use**: Used in base58 decoding to map powers of 58 to powers of 2.


---
### enc\_table\_64
- **Type**: ``uint``
- **Description**: Contains unique values less than 58^5 that are used in calculations related to base58 encoding. The table is structured to map powers of 2 to sums of products involving powers of 58.
- **Use**: Used in base58 encoding processes to facilitate the conversion of binary data to base58 representation.


---
### dec\_table\_64
- **Type**: ``static uint const``
- **Description**: Contains unique values less than 2^32 such that 58^(5*(16-j)) equals the sum of the table values multiplied by 2^(32*(15-k)). It is a two-dimensional array with dimensions defined by `INTERMEDIATE_SZ` and `BINARY_SZ`.
- **Use**: Used to decode base58 encoded data by mapping powers of 58 to powers of 2.
