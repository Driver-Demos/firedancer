Methods for converting between binary data and base58 encoding, including encoding and decoding functions.

# Purpose
The `fd_base58.h` header file provides function prototypes and macros for encoding and decoding data between binary format and base58 encoding. It defines constants for the maximum lengths and sizes of base58-encoded strings resulting from 32-byte and 64-byte binary data conversions. The file includes macros to initialize character arrays for encoding operations and declares functions [`fd_base58_encode_32`](<#fd_base58_encode_32>) and [`fd_base58_encode_64`](<#fd_base58_encode_64>) for converting 32-byte and 64-byte binary data into base58 strings, respectively. It also declares [`fd_base58_decode_32`](<#fd_base58_decode_32>) and [`fd_base58_decode_64`](<#fd_base58_decode_64>) for decoding base58 strings back into binary format. These conversions are optimized for performance but should be used cautiously in performance-critical applications due to the inherently slow nature of base58 encoding.
