Fuzz testing for Base58 decoding functions with memory sanitization and error handling.

# Purpose
The code is a fuzz testing module designed to test the robustness of Base58 decoding functions. It is intended to be used in a hosted environment, as indicated by the preprocessor directive that checks for `FD_HAS_HOSTED`. The module includes necessary headers for standard input/output operations and utility functions from the `fd_util` and `fd_fuzz` libraries. The [`LLVMFuzzerInitialize`](<#llvmfuzzerinitialize>) function sets up the environment by disabling backtraces, initializing the application with `fd_boot`, and setting the log level to crash on warnings. This function ensures that the environment is correctly configured before fuzz testing begins.

The core functionality is provided by the [`LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`](<#llvmfuzzertestoneinput>) function, which takes a byte array as input, converts it into a null-terminated string, and tests it against two Base58 decoding functions: `fd_base58_decode_32` and `fd_base58_decode_64`. The [`touch`](<#touch>) function is used to read every byte in the output buffer to trigger AddressSanitizer (ASan) checks for uninitialized data. The module ensures that all code paths are covered by using the `FD_FUZZ_MUST_BE_COVERED` macro. This setup is typical for fuzz testing, where the goal is to identify potential vulnerabilities or unexpected behavior in the decoding functions when handling various inputs.

# Functions

---
### LLVMFuzzerInitialize<!-- {{#callable:LLVMFuzzerInitialize}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/ballet/base58/fuzz_base58_garbage.c#L12>)

Initializes the fuzzer environment by setting environment variables, booting the system, registering an exit function, and setting the log level.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: A pointer to the argument count, typically from the command line.
    - `argv`: A pointer to the argument vector, typically from the command line.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Set the environment variable `FD_LOG_BACKTRACE` to `0` to disable backtraces in logs.
    - Call `fd_boot` with `argc` and `argv` to initialize the system.
    - Register `fd_halt` to be called on program exit using `atexit`.
    - Set the core log level to `3` using `fd_log_level_core_set`, which will cause the program to crash on warning logs.
    - Return `0` to indicate successful initialization.
- **Output**: Returns `0` to indicate successful initialization.

### touch<!-- {{#callable:touch}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/ballet/base58/fuzz_base58_garbage.c#L27>)

Reads every byte in a given memory region to allow ASan to detect uninitialized data.
- **Inputs**:
    - `in`: A pointer to the memory region to read.
    - `in_sz`: The size of the memory region in bytes.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Initialize a pointer `_in` to the input memory region `in`.
    - Initialize a variable `x` to zero.
    - Iterate over each byte in the memory region from index `0` to `in_sz - 1`.
    - For each byte, perform a bitwise XOR operation with `x` and the current byte.
    - Call `FD_COMPILER_UNPREDICTABLE` with `x` to prevent compiler optimizations that could remove the loop.
- **Output**: No output is returned; the function is used for its side effect of reading memory.

### LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput<!-- {{#callable:LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/ballet/base58/fuzz_base58_garbage.c#L38>)

Processes input data by converting it to a C-style string and attempts to decode it using Base58 decoding functions.
- **Inputs**:
    - `data`: A pointer to an array of unsigned characters representing the input data.
    - `data_sz`: The size of the input data array.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Allocate memory for a C-style string with a size of `data_sz + 1` to accommodate a null terminator.
    - Copy the input data into the allocated memory and append a null terminator to form a C-style string.
    - Attempt to decode the C-style string using `fd_base58_decode_32` into a 32-byte output array.
    - If decoding is successful, call [`touch`](<#touch>) on the output array to ensure all bytes are accessed.
    - Attempt to decode the C-style string using `fd_base58_decode_64` into a 64-byte output array.
    - If decoding is successful, call [`touch`](<#touch>) on the output array to ensure all bytes are accessed.
    - Free the allocated memory for the C-style string.
    - Return 0 to indicate successful execution.
- **Output**: Returns 0 to indicate successful execution.
- **Functions Called**:
    - [`touch`](<#touch>)
