Tests for the Poseidon hash function and benchmarks its performance.

# Purpose
The code is a C program that serves as a test suite for benchmarking and validating the functionality of the Poseidon hash function and scalar multiplication operations using the BN254 curve. The program includes a [`main`](<#main>) function, which is the entry point for execution. It initializes necessary components, performs a series of hash computations and scalar multiplications, and verifies the results against expected outputs using the `FD_TEST` macro. The program also logs performance metrics such as the number of operations per second and the time per call using the [`log_bench`](<#log_bench>) function.

The code includes several key components: a [`byte_swap_32`](<#byte_swap_32>) function for byte-swapping operations, and multiple test cases that validate the Poseidon hash function with different inputs and configurations. The tests ensure that the hash function produces the expected results by comparing the computed hash values with predefined "gold" values. The program also benchmarks the Poseidon hash function by measuring the time taken to process a series of inputs and logs the results. The use of `fd_poseidon_init`, `fd_poseidon_append`, and `fd_poseidon_fini` functions indicates that the code is designed to work with a specific Poseidon hash implementation, and it is structured to test and validate the correctness and performance of this implementation.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `fd_poseidon.h`
- `../../util/fd_util.h`


# Functions

---
### byte\_swap\_32<!-- {{#callable:byte_swap_32}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/ballet/bn254/test_poseidon.c#L5>)

Reverses the order of bytes in a 32-byte array.
- **Inputs**:
    - `v`: A pointer to an array of unsigned characters (`uchar`) that represents a 32-byte integer.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Iterates over the first half of the array using a loop with index `i`.
    - Swaps the byte at position `i` with the byte at position `FD_POSEIDON_HASH_SZ-1U-i`.
    - Continues swapping until the middle of the array is reached.
- **Output**: No return value; the function modifies the input array in place.


---
### log\_bench<!-- {{#callable:log_bench}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/ballet/bn254/test_poseidon.c#L14>)

Logs the performance metrics of a benchmark test, including the rate of iterations per second and the average time per call.
- **Inputs**:
    - ``descr``: A constant character pointer that describes the benchmark being logged.
    - ``iter``: An unsigned long integer representing the number of iterations performed in the benchmark.
    - ``dt``: A long integer representing the total time taken for the benchmark in microseconds.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Calculate `khz` as the number of iterations per second per core, scaled to kilohertz, using the formula `1e6f * (float)iter / (float)dt`.
    - Calculate `tau` as the average time per call in nanoseconds, using the formula `(float)dt / (float)iter`.
    - Log the benchmark description, iterations per second per core, and average time per call using the `FD_LOG_NOTICE` macro.
- **Output**: No return value; the function logs the performance metrics using the `FD_LOG_NOTICE` macro.


---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/ballet/bn254/test_poseidon.c#L23>)

Initializes the environment, performs a series of cryptographic operations and benchmarks, and then terminates the program.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments.
    - `argv`: An array of command-line arguments.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Calls `fd_boot` to initialize the environment with command-line arguments.
    - Declares a byte array `bytes` of size 416 to store data for operations.
    - Performs a benchmark of the `fd_bn254_scalar_mul` function by multiplying two constant scalar values `_a` and `_b` a million times and logs the performance.
    - Initializes `bytes` with a value of 1 and performs a Poseidon hash, comparing the result with a predefined `gold` value to verify correctness.
    - Repeats the Poseidon hash operation with different initializations of `bytes` and different expected `gold` values to verify correctness.
    - Performs a series of Poseidon hash operations on predefined input arrays and compares the results with expected output arrays to verify correctness.
    - Performs a benchmark of the Poseidon hash function with varying input sizes and logs the performance.
    - Logs a notice indicating the successful completion of all tests and benchmarks.
    - Calls `fd_halt` to terminate the program.
- **Output**: Returns 0 to indicate successful execution.
- **Functions Called**:
    - [`log_bench`](<#log_bench>)
    - [`fd_poseidon_hash`](<fd_poseidon.h.md#fd_poseidon_hash>)
    - [`fd_poseidon_fini`](<fd_poseidon.c.md#fd_poseidon_fini>)
    - [`fd_poseidon_append`](<fd_poseidon.c.md#fd_poseidon_append>)
    - [`byte_swap_32`](<#byte_swap_32>)
