Defines static constant arrays for Poseidon hash function parameters using BN254 curve, including round constants and MDS matrices.

# Purpose
The code defines a series of static constant arrays that provide essential parameters for the Poseidon cryptographic hash function, specifically tailored for use with the BN254 curve. These arrays are organized by different widths (2 to 13) and rounds, and are named using the convention `fd_poseidon_ark_w` and `fd_poseidon_mds_w`, where `w` indicates the width of the Poseidon permutation. The `fd_poseidon_ark_w` arrays contain round constants, which introduce non-linearity in each round of the Poseidon permutation, while the `fd_poseidon_mds_w` arrays contain Maximum Distance Separable (MDS) matrices, which ensure diffusion by mixing the state in each round. The arrays are composed of structures that hold four 64-bit integers, representing scalars in Montgomery form, and are intended for internal use within a cryptographic library. The code does not define public APIs or external interfaces but serves as a configuration file providing constants necessary for implementing the Poseidon hash function in cryptographic applications.
