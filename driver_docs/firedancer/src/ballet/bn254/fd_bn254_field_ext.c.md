Implements extension fields Fp2, Fp6, and Fp12 for BN254, including arithmetic operations and conversions.

# Purpose
The code provides functionality for arithmetic operations in extension fields `Fp2`, `Fp6`, and `Fp12`, which are used in cryptographic computations, particularly in pairing-based cryptography. The code is based on mathematical concepts from the paper referenced in the comments and implements operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, squaring, inversion, and Frobenius maps in these fields. The elements in these fields are represented in Montgomery form, which is a method used to speed up modular arithmetic operations.

The code defines several constants and functions for handling elements in the `Fp2`, `Fp6`, and `Fp12` fields. It includes functions for converting elements to and from Montgomery form, checking properties like negativity and equality, and performing arithmetic operations. The functions are implemented as inline functions for efficiency. The code is structured to be part of a larger cryptographic library, as indicated by the use of specific data types like `fd_bn254_fp2_t`, `fd_bn254_fp6_t`, and `fd_bn254_fp12_t`, which are likely defined in the included header file `fd_bn254.h`. The operations are optimized for performance, as seen in the use of algorithms from cryptographic research papers.

[View Source →](<../../../../../src/ballet/bn254/fd_bn254_field_ext.c#L672>)

Computes the inverse of an element in the Fp12 extension field using a specific algorithm.
- **Inputs**:
    - ``r``: A pointer to an `fd_bn254_fp12_t` structure where the result will be stored.
    - ``a``: A constant pointer to an `fd_bn254_fp12_t` structure representing the element to invert.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Initialize temporary variables `t0` and `t1` of type `fd_bn254_fp6_t`.
    - Compute the square of `a->el[0]` and store it in `t0`.
    - Compute the square of `a->el[1]` and store it in `t1`.
    - Multiply `t1` by gamma and store the result back in `t1`.
    - Subtract `t1` from `t0` and store the result in `t0`.
    - Compute the inverse of `t0` and store it in `t1`.
    - Multiply `a->el[0]` by `t1` and store the result in `r->el[0]`.
    - Multiply `a->el[1]` by `t1`, negate the result, and store it in `r->el[1]`.
- **Output**: Returns a pointer to the `fd_bn254_fp12_t` structure `r` containing the inverse of `a`.

[View Source →](<../../../../../src/ballet/bn254/fd_bn254_field_ext.c#L688>)

Applies the Frobenius endomorphism to an element in the field `Fp12`.
- **Inputs**:
    - ``r``: A pointer to the `fd_bn254_fp12_t` structure where the result will be stored.
    - ``a``: A constant pointer to the `fd_bn254_fp12_t` structure representing the input element to which the Frobenius endomorphism is applied.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Initialize an array `t` of type `fd_bn254_fp2_t` to store intermediate results.
    - Compute the conjugate of each element in `a` and store the results in `r` and `t`.
    - Multiply the conjugates stored in `t` by the corresponding constants from `fd_bn254_const_frob_gamma1_mont` and store the results in `r`.
    - Return the pointer `r` containing the result of the Frobenius endomorphism.
- **Output**: A pointer to the `fd_bn254_fp12_t` structure `r` containing the result of the Frobenius endomorphism.

[View Source →](<../../../../../src/ballet/bn254/fd_bn254_field_ext.c#L719>)

Applies the Frobenius endomorphism squared to an element in the field `Fp12` using precomputed constants.
- **Inputs**:
    - ``r``: A pointer to an `fd_bn254_fp12_t` structure where the result will be stored.
