Makefile for adding headers, objects, and conditional fuzz tests for the `fd_toml` component.

# Purpose
The `Makefile` content defines build instructions for a project. It uses the `add-hdrs` and `add-objs` functions to include the header file `fd_toml.h` and object files `fd_toml` and `fd_ballet` in the build process. If the `FD_HAS_HOSTED` variable is defined, it also calls the `make-fuzz-test` function to create a fuzz test named `fuzz_toml`, which depends on `fd_ballet` and `fd_util`.
