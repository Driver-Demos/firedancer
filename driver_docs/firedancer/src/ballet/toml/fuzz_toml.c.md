Fuzz testing for TOML parsing using LLVM's libFuzzer framework.

# Purpose
The code is a fuzz testing module designed to test the parsing functionality of a TOML parser. It is intended to be used with a fuzzing framework, such as LLVM's libFuzzer. The module includes the necessary headers for standard input/output operations and utility functions from the project's library. It defines two main functions: [`LLVMFuzzerInitialize`](<#llvmfuzzerinitialize>) and [`LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`](<#llvmfuzzertestoneinput>). 

[`LLVMFuzzerInitialize`](<#llvmfuzzerinitialize>) sets up the environment for the fuzzer by configuring logging levels and initializing the application without signal handlers. It uses environment variables and utility functions like `fd_boot` and `fd_halt` to manage the application's lifecycle. [`LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`](<#llvmfuzzertestoneinput>) is the core function that receives input data from the fuzzer. It attempts to parse the input data as TOML using the `fd_toml_parse` function. The function uses a scratch buffer and a POD (Plain Old Data) structure to handle the parsing process. The module ensures that the parsing process does not produce errors by disabling error logging, which is useful for fuzz testing where invalid inputs are expected.

# Functions

---
### LLVMFuzzerInitialize<!-- {{#callable:LLVMFuzzerInitialize}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/ballet/toml/fuzz_toml.c#L13>)

Initializes the fuzzer environment by setting environment variables, booting the system, and configuring logging levels.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: A pointer to the argument count, typically passed from the command line.
    - `argv`: A pointer to the argument vector, typically passed from the command line.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Set the environment variable `FD_LOG_BACKTRACE` to `0` to disable backtrace logging.
    - Call `fd_boot` with `argc` and `argv` to initialize the system.
    - Register `fd_halt` to be called at program exit using `atexit`.
    - Set the standard error log level to `4` using `fd_log_level_stderr_set`.
    - Set the logfile log level to `4` using `fd_log_level_logfile_set`.
    - Return `0` to indicate successful initialization.
- **Output**: Returns `0` to indicate successful initialization.

### LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput<!-- {{#callable:LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/ballet/toml/fuzz_toml.c#L27>)

Parses TOML data from a given input buffer and stores it in a POD structure.
- **Inputs**:
    - `data_`: A pointer to the input data buffer containing TOML data to parse.
    - `size`: The size of the input data buffer in bytes.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Cast `data_` to a `char` pointer and assign it to `data`.
    - Declare a `scratch` buffer of 128 bytes for temporary storage during parsing.
    - Declare a `pod_data` buffer of 256 bytes to hold the POD structure data.
    - Create a new POD structure using `fd_pod_new` and join it with `fd_pod_join`, storing the result in `pod`.
    - Parse the TOML data using [`fd_toml_parse`](<fd_toml.c.md#fd_toml_parse>), passing `data`, `size`, `pod`, `scratch`, and the size of `scratch`.
    - Delete the POD structure using `fd_pod_delete` after leaving it with `fd_pod_leave`.
    - Return 0 to indicate successful execution.
- **Output**: Returns 0 to indicate successful execution.
- **Functions Called**:
    - [`fd_toml_parse`](<fd_toml.c.md#fd_toml_parse>)
