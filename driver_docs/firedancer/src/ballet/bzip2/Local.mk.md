Makefile logic for checking bzip2 installation and compiling related objects.

# Purpose
This Makefile script checks for the presence of the `bzlib.c` file in the specified directory `$(OPT)/git/bzip2/`. If the file is not found, it issues a warning that bzip2 is not installed and skips further actions. If the file is present, it sets the `FD_HAS_BZIP2` flag to 1 and appends a corresponding definition to `CFLAGS`. It defines a list of object files `BZ2_OBJS` related to bzip2 and specifies a rule to build these object files into a static library `libfd_ballet.a`. The script also modifies `CFLAGS_NOWARN` to exclude warning-related flags and defines a rule to compile each source file into an object file, creating necessary directories as needed.
