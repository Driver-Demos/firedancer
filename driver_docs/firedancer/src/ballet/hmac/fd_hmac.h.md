APIs for computing HMAC digests using SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512 algorithms.

# Purpose
This C header file defines an interface for computing HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code) using different SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm) variants. It includes function prototypes for [`fd_hmac_sha256`](<#fd_hmac_sha256>), [`fd_hmac_sha384`](<#fd_hmac_sha384>), and [`fd_hmac_sha512`](<#fd_hmac_sha512>), which compute HMAC digests using SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512 algorithms, respectively. Each function takes a message and a key as input, along with their sizes, and outputs the computed HMAC digest into a provided memory region. The file also defines a function pointer type, `fd_hmac_fn_t`, for HMAC functions, facilitating the use of these functions in a flexible manner. The header file includes a dependency on `fd_ballet_base.h`, indicating it relies on definitions or declarations from that file.
