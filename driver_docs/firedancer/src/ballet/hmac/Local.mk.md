Makefile for building and testing HMAC components with unit and fuzz tests.

# Purpose
This Makefile script is used to manage the build process for a software project. It adds headers and object files using the `add-hdrs` and `add-objs` functions, respectively, for the `fd_hmac` and `fd_ballet` components. It also defines a unit test named `test_hmac` and specifies its dependencies on `fd_ballet` and `fd_util`. The script includes a conditional statement that, if `FD_HAS_HOSTED` is defined, creates a fuzz test named `fuzz_hmac` with dependencies on `fd_ballet` and `fd_util`.
