Makefile for building and testing the SipHash13 implementation with unit and fuzz tests.

# Purpose
The `Makefile` content defines build and test instructions for the `fd_siphash13` component. It adds headers and object files using `add-hdrs` and `add-objs` functions, respectively. It creates and runs a unit test named `test_siphash13` with dependencies on `fd_ballet` and `fd_util`. If the `FD_HAS_HOSTED` variable is defined, it also creates a fuzz test named `fuzz_siphash13` with the same dependencies.
