Defines macros and constants for constructing and using SBPF opcodes in the Firedancer project.

# Purpose
The code is a C header file that defines macros and constants for constructing and using opcodes in the context of eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter) and classic BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter) programs. It provides a set of macros for register shortcuts, opcode classes, source modes, size modes, ALU operation modes, jump operation modes, and address modes. These macros are used to define instruction opcodes for various operations such as arithmetic, logic, memory access, and control flow within BPF programs.

The file includes definitions for both 32-bit and 64-bit operations, supporting a wide range of instructions that can be used in BPF programs. The macros `FD_SBPF_DEFINE_NORM_INSTR` and `FD_SBPF_DEFINE_MEM_INSTR` are used to construct normal and memory access instruction opcodes, respectively. The file also defines specific opcode constants for operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, logical operations, and various jump conditions. This header file is intended to be included in other C source files that require these opcode definitions for BPF program development.
