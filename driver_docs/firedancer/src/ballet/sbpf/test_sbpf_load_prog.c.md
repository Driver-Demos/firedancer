A test program for loading and processing sBPF programs, with redundant functionality noted.

# Purpose
This code is an executable C program designed to load and process sBPF (Solana Berkeley Packet Filter) programs from a binary file. It begins by parsing command-line arguments to determine the paths for the binary input file and an optional output file for read-only data segments. The program then opens the specified binary file, checks its type and size, and reads its contents into memory. It uses the `fd_sbpf_loader` and `fd_sbpf_opcodes` libraries to extract ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) information and configure the sBPF loader. The program allocates memory for the read-only data segment and other necessary objects, such as the sBPF program and syscall structures.

The program proceeds to load and relocate the sBPF program, inserting syscall identifiers from a predefined list. If the `--fixup-calls` option is specified, it adjusts the call destinations within the program's text segment. The program outputs the read-only data segment to a specified file if the `--rodata-out` option is provided. After processing, it cleans up allocated resources and closes the file handles. The program logs various stages of execution and errors, ensuring that any issues encountered during the loading and processing of the sBPF program are reported.

- **Description**: An array of constant unsigned integers that represents syscall identifiers.
- **Use**: Used to insert syscall identifiers into the `fd_sbpf_syscalls_t` structure for program loading and relocation.

Processes command-line arguments to load, validate, and execute an sBPF program from a binary file, optionally fixing up call destinations and writing the read-only data segment to a specified file.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments.
    - `argv`: An array of command-line argument strings.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Calls `fd_boot` to initialize the environment with command-line arguments.
    - Parses command-line arguments to extract `--bin`, `--rodata-out`, and `--fixup-calls` options.
    - Validates that the `--bin` argument is specified, logging an error if not.
    - Opens the binary file specified by `--bin` and checks if it is a regular file with a valid size.
    - Reads the binary file into memory and logs the loading process.
    - Extracts ELF information from the binary buffer using [`fd_sbpf_elf_peek`](<fd_sbpf_loader.c.md#fd_sbpf_elf_peek>) and checks for errors.
    - Allocates memory for the read-only data segment and program objects, checking for allocation failures.
    - Creates a new sBPF program and syscall objects, inserting predefined syscalls into the syscall object.
    - Loads the sBPF program into memory, using a scratch buffer for temporary storage.
    - If `--fixup-calls` is specified, iterates over the program's instructions to adjust call destinations.
    - Logs the read-only data segment and writes it to the specified file if `--rodata-out` is provided.
    - Cleans up allocated resources and closes the binary file, logging any errors during cleanup.
    - Checks for errors in loading the program and logs a success message if no errors occurred.
    - Calls `fd_halt` to terminate the program and returns 0.
- **Output**: Returns 0 on successful execution, indicating the program completed without errors.
- **Functions Called**:
    - [`fd_sbpf_elf_peek`](<fd_sbpf_loader.c.md#fd_sbpf_elf_peek>)
    - [`fd_sbpf_program_align`](<fd_sbpf_loader.c.md#fd_sbpf_program_align>)
    - [`fd_sbpf_program_footprint`](<fd_sbpf_loader.c.md#fd_sbpf_program_footprint>)
    - [`fd_sbpf_program_new`](<fd_sbpf_loader.c.md#fd_sbpf_program_new>)
    - [`fd_sbpf_program_load`](<fd_sbpf_loader.c.md#fd_sbpf_program_load>)
    - [`fd_sbpf_program_delete`](<fd_sbpf_loader.c.md#fd_sbpf_program_delete>)
