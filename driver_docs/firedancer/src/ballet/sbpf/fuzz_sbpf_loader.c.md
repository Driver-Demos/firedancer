Fuzz testing for the SBPF loader with syscall handling and program loading validation.

# Purpose
The code is a fuzz testing module for a software component that involves loading and executing eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter) programs. It is designed to work with the LLVM fuzzer, a tool used to test the robustness of software by providing random inputs. The module includes two main functions: [`LLVMFuzzerInitialize`](<#llvmfuzzerinitialize>) and [`LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`](<#llvmfuzzertestoneinput>). The [`LLVMFuzzerInitialize`](<#llvmfuzzerinitialize>) function sets up the environment for the fuzzer by configuring logging and initializing necessary components. The [`LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`](<#llvmfuzzertestoneinput>) function is the core of the fuzz testing process, where it attempts to load and execute eBPF programs from the provided input data.

The module includes several key components: it defines a list of syscall identifiers in `_syscalls`, which are used to configure the eBPF program's environment. The function `fd_sbpf_elf_peek` is used to inspect the input data to determine if it can be processed as an eBPF program. Memory is allocated for program data and syscall structures, and the `fd_sbpf_program_load` function attempts to load the program. The code ensures that at least one program can be loaded and one cannot, which is a requirement for the fuzz testing process. The module also includes cleanup operations to free allocated resources after testing. This code is intended to be part of a larger testing framework and does not define public APIs or external interfaces.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `../../util/sanitize/fd_fuzz.h`
- `fd_sbpf_loader.h`
- `stdlib.h`


# Global Variables

---
### \_syscalls
- **Type**: ``uint const[]``
- **Description**: An array of constant unsigned integers that represent syscall identifiers. The array is terminated with a zero value to indicate the end of the list.
- **Use**: Used to insert syscall identifiers into a `fd_sbpf_syscalls_t` structure for further processing.


# Functions

---
### LLVMFuzzerInitialize<!-- {{#callable:LLVMFuzzerInitialize}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/ballet/sbpf/fuzz_sbpf_loader.c#L22>)

Initializes the fuzzer environment by setting environment variables, booting the system, registering an exit function, and setting the log level.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: A pointer to the argument count, typically passed from the main function.
    - `argv`: A pointer to the argument vector, typically passed from the main function.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Set the environment variable `FD_LOG_BACKTRACE` to `0` to disable backtrace logging.
    - Call `fd_boot` with `argc` and `argv` to initialize the system.
    - Register `fd_halt` to be called on program exit using `atexit`.
    - Set the core log level to `3` using `fd_log_level_core_set`, which will cause the program to crash on warning logs.
    - Return `0` to indicate successful initialization.
- **Output**: Returns `0` to indicate successful initialization.

### LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput<!-- {{#callable:LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/ballet/sbpf/fuzz_sbpf_loader.c#L33>)

Tests an input buffer by attempting to load it as an sBPF program and checks for successful and unsuccessful load scenarios.
- **Inputs**:
    - `data`: A pointer to the input buffer containing the data to test.
    - `size`: The size of the input buffer in bytes.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Initialize `fd_sbpf_elf_info_t` and `fd_sbpf_loader_config_t` structures, setting `sbpf_max_version` to `FD_SBPF_V3`.
    - Call [`fd_sbpf_elf_peek`](<fd_sbpf_loader.c.md#fd_sbpf_elf_peek>) to inspect the ELF data in the input buffer; return -1 if it fails.
    - Allocate memory for `rodata` using `malloc` with the size from `info.bin_sz`.
    - Create a new `fd_sbpf_program_t` object using [`fd_sbpf_program_new`](<fd_sbpf_loader.c.md#fd_sbpf_program_new>) with aligned memory allocation and check for success.
    - Create a new `fd_sbpf_syscalls_t` object using `fd_sbpf_syscalls_new` with aligned memory allocation and check for success.
    - Insert predefined syscall values from `_syscalls` array into the `syscalls` object using `fd_sbpf_syscalls_insert`.
    - Allocate memory for `scratch` using `malloc` with the size of the input buffer.
    - Load the program using [`fd_sbpf_program_load`](<fd_sbpf_loader.c.md#fd_sbpf_program_load>) with the input data, size, syscalls, and configuration; store the result in `res`.
    - Check if the program load was successful or not using `FD_UNLIKELY` and ensure both scenarios are covered with `FD_FUZZ_MUST_BE_COVERED`.
    - Free allocated memory for `rodata`, `scratch`, and delete `syscalls` and `prog` objects using their respective delete functions.
- **Output**: Returns 0 after testing the input buffer and cleaning up resources, or -1 if the initial ELF peek fails.
- **Functions Called**:
    - [`fd_sbpf_elf_peek`](<fd_sbpf_loader.c.md#fd_sbpf_elf_peek>)
    - [`fd_sbpf_program_new`](<fd_sbpf_loader.c.md#fd_sbpf_program_new>)
    - [`fd_sbpf_program_align`](<fd_sbpf_loader.c.md#fd_sbpf_program_align>)
    - [`fd_sbpf_program_footprint`](<fd_sbpf_loader.c.md#fd_sbpf_program_footprint>)
    - [`fd_sbpf_program_load`](<fd_sbpf_loader.c.md#fd_sbpf_program_load>)
    - [`fd_sbpf_program_delete`](<fd_sbpf_loader.c.md#fd_sbpf_program_delete>)
