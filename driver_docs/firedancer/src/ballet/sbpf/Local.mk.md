Makefile for adding headers, objects, and defining unit and fuzz tests for SBPF components.

# Purpose
The Makefile content defines build and test instructions for a software project. It uses the `add-hdrs` and `add-objs` functions to specify header files and object files, respectively, for the `fd_sbpf_loader` and `fd_ballet` components. The `ifdef FD_HAS_HOSTED` directive checks if the `FD_HAS_HOSTED` variable is defined, and if so, it includes commands to create and run unit tests for components such as `test_sbpf_load_prog`, `test_sbpf_loader`, and `test_sbpf_elf_peek`. Additionally, it includes a command to create a fuzz test for `fuzz_sbpf_loader`. These instructions help automate the compilation and testing processes, ensuring that the software components are correctly built and verified.
