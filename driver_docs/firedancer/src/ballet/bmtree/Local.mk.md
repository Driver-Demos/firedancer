Makefile for adding headers, objects, and unit tests, with optional fuzz testing for `fd_bmtree`.

# Purpose
This Makefile snippet defines build and test instructions for a software project. It adds the header file `fd_bmtree.h` and object files `fd_bmtree` and `fd_ballet` to the build process. It specifies the creation and execution of a unit test named `test_bmtree`, which depends on `fd_ballet` and `fd_util`. If the `FD_HAS_HOSTED` variable is defined, it also creates a fuzz test named `fuzz_bmtree` with dependencies on `fd_ballet` and `fd_util`.
