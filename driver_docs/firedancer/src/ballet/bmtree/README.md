Functions, APIs, and tests for binary Merkle trees using SHA-256, including fuzz testing and a Makefile.


## Files
- **[fd_bmtree.c](fd_bmtree.c.md)**: Functions for binary Merkle trees using SHA-256, supporting different tree widths and operations like hashing, merging, and proof management.
- **[fd_bmtree.h](fd_bmtree.h.md)**: APIs for binary Merkle trees using SHA256, including construction, inclusion proofs, and verification.
- **[fuzz_bmtree.c](fuzz_bmtree.c.md)**: Fuzz testing implementation for binary Merkle trees with memory management and proof verification.
- **[Local.mk](Local.mk.md)**: Makefile for adding headers, objects, and unit tests, with optional fuzz testing for `fd_bmtree`.
- **[test_bmtree.c](test_bmtree.c.md)**: Tests for the construction and verification of binary Merkle trees using 20-byte and 32-byte nodes.
