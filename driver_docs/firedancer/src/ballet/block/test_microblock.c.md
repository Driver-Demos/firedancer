Tests for the layout and size of `fd_microblock_hdr_t` in the `firedancer` codebase.

# Purpose
This code is a C program that performs static assertions to verify the layout of the `fd_microblock_hdr_t` structure. It includes the header file `fd_microblock.h` and uses `FD_STATIC_ASSERT` to check that the size of `fd_microblock_hdr_t` is 48 bytes and that specific fields within the structure have expected offsets. The [`main`](<#main>) function initializes the program with `fd_boot`, logs a notice indicating a successful pass, and then terminates with `fd_halt`. The program is designed to ensure that the memory layout of the `fd_microblock_hdr_t` structure meets predefined specifications, which is critical for maintaining data integrity and compatibility.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `fd_microblock.h`
- `stddef.h`


# Functions

---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/ballet/block/test_microblock.c#L9>)

Initializes the program, logs a notice, and halts execution.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The count of command-line arguments passed to the program.
    - `argv`: An array of strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Calls `fd_boot` with pointers to `argc` and `argv` to initialize the program environment.
    - Logs a notice message 'pass' using `FD_LOG_NOTICE`.
    - Calls `fd_halt` to terminate the program execution.
    - Returns 0 to indicate successful execution.
- **Output**: Returns an integer 0, indicating successful execution.
