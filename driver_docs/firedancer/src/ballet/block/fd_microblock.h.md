Defines a packed structure for a microblock header with fields for hash count, hash, and transaction count.

# Purpose
This code is a C header file that defines a data structure for a microblock header in a blockchain context. The `fd_microblock_hdr` structure is packed and contains three fields: `hash_cnt`, `hash`, and `txn_cnt`. The `hash_cnt` field is an unsigned long integer that represents the number of Proof of History (PoH) hashes between the current and the last microblock. The `hash` field is an array of unsigned characters that stores the PoH state after evaluating the current microblock, using the SHA-256 hash size defined in `fd_sha256.h`. The `txn_cnt` field is an unsigned long integer that indicates the number of transactions in the microblock. The file includes dependencies on `fd_ballet_base.h` and `fd_sha256.h` for base definitions and SHA-256 hashing functionality, respectively.
# Imports and Dependencies

# Data Structures

---
### fd\_microblock\_hdr
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `hash_cnt`: Stores the number of PoH hashes between this and the last microblock.
    - `hash`: Contains the PoH state after evaluating this microblock, including all appends and mixin.
    - `txn_cnt`: Indicates the number of transactions in this microblock.
- **Description**: Defines a packed structure that represents the header of a microblock, including the count of PoH hashes, the PoH state, and the transaction count.


---
### fd\_microblock\_hdr\_t
- **Type**: ``struct fd_microblock_hdr``
- **Members**:
    - ``hash_cnt``: Number of PoH hashes between this and the last microblock.
    - ``hash``: PoH state after evaluating this microblock, including all appends and mixin.
    - ``txn_cnt``: Number of transactions in this microblock.
- **Description**: Represents the header of a microblock, containing information about the number of PoH hashes since the last microblock, the PoH state after processing the current microblock, and the number of transactions included in the microblock.
