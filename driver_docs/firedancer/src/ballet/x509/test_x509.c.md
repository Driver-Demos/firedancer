Tests for X.509 certificate mock functions, including public key extraction and certificate validation.

# Purpose
The code is a C program designed to test the functionality of X.509 certificate handling, specifically focusing on the mock generation and validation of public keys from certificates. It includes the main function, which initializes a random number generator and performs a series of tests on predefined certificate data. The program uses the `fd_x509_mock_pubkey` function to extract public keys from mock certificates and verifies the correctness of these extractions through assertions. It also tests the robustness of the extraction process by introducing controlled corruption into the certificate data and checking if the extraction fails as expected.

The program is structured to test both version 1 and version 2 certificates. It includes static arrays representing mock certificates and uses a loop to generate random public keys, create corresponding certificates, and verify the integrity of the public key extraction process. The code also tests boundary conditions by attempting to extract public keys from certificates with varying sizes. The program concludes by cleaning up resources and logging a success message if all tests pass. This code is intended to be executed as a standalone test suite for validating the behavior of the X.509 mock certificate functions.

Initializes the environment, tests certificate and public key extraction, and verifies integrity through random corruption and validation.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments.
    - `argv`: An array of command-line arguments.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Calls `fd_boot` to initialize the environment with command-line arguments.
    - Creates a random number generator `rng` using `fd_rng_new` and `fd_rng_join`.
    - Tests certificate version 1 by extracting the public key from `cert_v1_1` and `cert_v1_2` using [`fd_x509_mock_pubkey`](<fd_x509_mock.c.md#fd_x509_mock_pubkey>) and verifies the extraction with `FD_TEST`.
    - Checks out-of-bounds key extraction by iterating over a range and verifying that extraction fails for certain offsets.
    - Tests certificate version 2 by generating random public keys, creating certificates with [`fd_x509_mock_cert`](<fd_x509_mock.c.md#fd_x509_mock_cert>), and verifying the integrity of the extracted public key against the original.
    - Corrupts random bytes in the certificate and verifies that extraction fails when corruption occurs in specific regions.
    - Deletes the random number generator using `fd_rng_delete` and `fd_rng_leave`.
    - Logs a success message with `FD_LOG_NOTICE` and halts the program with `fd_halt`.
- **Output**: Returns 0 to indicate successful execution.
- **Functions Called**:
    - [`fd_x509_mock_pubkey`](<fd_x509_mock.c.md#fd_x509_mock_pubkey>)
    - [`fd_x509_mock_cert`](<fd_x509_mock.c.md#fd_x509_mock_cert>)
