Makefile for adding headers, objects, and running unit tests for x509 in the firedancer codebase.

# Purpose
The content defines build instructions for a software project using a Makefile. It adds the header file `fd_x509_mock.h` and object files `fd_x509_mock` and `fd_ballet` to the build process. It also specifies a unit test named `test_x509`, which depends on the `fd_ballet` and `fd_util` components, and includes instructions to run this unit test.
