Fuzz testing for transaction parsing with initialization and input handling functions.

# Purpose
The code is a fuzz testing module designed to test the robustness of transaction parsing functionality. It is intended to be used with a fuzzing framework, as indicated by the presence of [`LLVMFuzzerInitialize`](<#llvmfuzzerinitialize>) and [`LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`](<#llvmfuzzertestoneinput>) functions. The module includes necessary headers and dependencies, such as `fd_util.h`, `fd_fuzz.h`, and `fd_txn.h`, which provide utility functions, fuzzing support, and transaction-related operations, respectively.

The [`LLVMFuzzerInitialize`](<#llvmfuzzerinitialize>) function sets up the environment for fuzz testing by configuring logging and registering a cleanup function with `atexit`. The [`LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`](<#llvmfuzzertestoneinput>) function is the core of the fuzz testing process. It takes input data and size, checks if the size is within a valid range, and attempts to parse the data into a transaction buffer. The function uses various macros and functions to ensure the parsed data meets expected conditions, such as alignment and size constraints. The use of `FD_FUZZ_MUST_BE_COVERED` indicates that certain code paths must be executed during fuzz testing to ensure comprehensive coverage.

# Functions

---
### LLVMFuzzerInitialize<!-- {{#callable:LLVMFuzzerInitialize}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/ballet/txn/fuzz_txn_parse.c#L12>)

Initializes the fuzzer environment by setting environment variables, booting the system, setting log levels, and registering an exit handler.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: A pointer to the argument count, typically from the command line.
    - `argv`: A pointer to the argument vector, typically from the command line.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Set the environment variable `FD_LOG_BACKTRACE` to `0` to disable backtraces in logs.
    - Call `fd_boot` with `argc` and `argv` to initialize the system.
    - Set the core log level to `3` using `fd_log_level_core_set`, which causes the program to crash on warning logs.
    - Register the `fd_halt` function to be called on program exit using `atexit`.
    - Return `0` to indicate successful initialization.
- **Output**: Returns `0` to indicate successful initialization.

### LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput<!-- {{#callable:LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/ballet/txn/fuzz_txn_parse.c#L23>)

Processes input data for fuzz testing by parsing it into a transaction buffer and validating its footprint.
- **Inputs**:
    - `data`: A pointer to the input data to be processed, of type `uchar const *`.
    - `size`: The size of the input data, of type `ulong`.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Check if `size` is greater than or equal to 1232; if true, return -1.
    - Declare an aligned transaction buffer `txn_buf` and initialize a `counters` structure to zero.
    - Parse the input data into `txn_buf` using [`fd_txn_parse`](<fd_txn.h.md#fd_txn_parse>), storing the result in `sz`.
    - Use `FD_COMPILER_UNPREDICTABLE` and `FD_COMPILER_MFENCE` to handle compiler optimizations and memory ordering.
    - If `sz` is greater than 0, assert that the transaction footprint is within the maximum size using `FD_TEST`.
    - Ensure coverage with `FD_FUZZ_MUST_BE_COVERED` macros.
    - Return 0 to indicate successful processing.
- **Output**: Returns 0 if the input data is processed successfully, or -1 if the size is too large.
- **Functions Called**:
    - [`fd_txn_parse`](<fd_txn.h.md#fd_txn_parse>)
    - [`fd_txn_footprint`](<fd_txn.h.md#fd_txn_footprint>)
