Defines BLAKE3 test vectors for use in cryptographic validation.

# Purpose
The code defines a set of test vectors for the BLAKE3 cryptographic hash function. It is not intended to be compiled directly but serves as a reference for verifying the correctness of BLAKE3 implementations. The test vectors are derived from standard test vectors available in a JSON format from the BLAKE3 team's repository. Each test vector consists of a message, its size, and the expected hash output. The `fd_blake3_test_vector` structure is used to store these components, and an array of these structures, `fd_blake3_test_vector`, holds multiple test cases with varying message lengths and corresponding hash values.

The code includes a static array `zeros` initialized with zero bytes, which is used in one of the test vectors. The macro `_` is defined to simplify the representation of hexadecimal values in the hash outputs. The code also includes conditional compilation directives to suppress specific compiler warnings when using GCC version 15 or higher. This file is a C source file that provides a collection of test vectors for use in testing and validating BLAKE3 hash function implementations. It does not define any public APIs or external interfaces but is intended to be used internally within a testing framework.
# Global Variables

---
### zeros
- **Type**: ``char const``
- **Description**: An array of 16384 constant characters, all initialized to zero. This array is defined as a static variable, meaning it is limited to the file scope and retains its value between function calls.
- **Use**: Used to provide a large block of zero-initialized data, likely for testing or buffer purposes.


---
### fd\_blake3\_test\_vector
- **Type**: ``fd_blake3_test_vector_t const[]``
- **Description**: An array of `fd_blake3_test_vector_t` structures, each containing a message, its size, and a corresponding hash value. The array is initialized with predefined test vectors for the BLAKE3 hash function.
- **Use**: Used to store and provide test vectors for verifying the BLAKE3 hash function implementation.


# Data Structures

---
### fd\_blake3\_test\_vector
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `msg`: A pointer to a constant character array representing the message.
    - `sz`: An unsigned long integer representing the size of the message.
    - `hash`: An array of 32 unsigned characters representing the hash of the message.
- **Description**: Defines a test vector for the BLAKE3 hash function, containing a message, its size, and the corresponding hash value.
