Makefile for building and testing BLAKE3 components with optional SSE, AVX, and AVX512 optimizations.

# Purpose
This Makefile script configures the build process for a software project. It adds header files and object files for the `fd_blake3` module and its variants, such as `fd_blake3_ref` and `fd_ballet`. The script conditionally includes additional object files based on the presence of specific CPU features, such as SSE, AVX512, and AVX, to optimize performance. It also defines and runs a unit test named `test_blake3` and conditionally sets up a fuzz test named `fuzz_blake3` if the `FD_HAS_HOSTED` environment variable is defined.
