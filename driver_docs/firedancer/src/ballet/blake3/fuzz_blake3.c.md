Fuzz testing for the BLAKE3 hash function using LLVM's libFuzzer.

# Purpose
The code is a fuzz testing module designed for use with LLVM's libFuzzer. It initializes a fuzzing environment and tests the `fd_blake3` hashing function. The [`LLVMFuzzerInitialize`](<#llvmfuzzerinitialize>) function sets up the environment by configuring logging and registering a cleanup function to be called at program exit. The [`LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`](<#llvmfuzzertestoneinput>) function is the core of the fuzzing process, which takes an input buffer and its size, hashes the input using the `fd_blake3` hashing algorithm, and verifies the consistency of the hash output by comparing two separate hash computations of the same input.

The module includes necessary headers for standard input/output operations and custom utilities from the `fd_util` and `fd_fuzz` libraries. It ensures that the target environment supports hosted execution by checking the `FD_HAS_HOSTED` macro. The code is structured to be integrated into a larger testing framework, providing a specific focus on validating the correctness and stability of the `fd_blake3` hashing function under various input conditions. The use of assertions ensures that any deviation from expected behavior is immediately flagged during the fuzzing process.
# Imports and Dependencies

---

- `../../util/sanitize/fd_fuzz.h`
- `fd_blake3.h`


# Functions

---
### LLVMFuzzerInitialize<!-- {{#callable:LLVMFuzzerInitialize}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/ballet/blake3/fuzz_blake3.c#L13>)

Initializes the fuzzer environment by setting environment variables, booting the system, setting log levels, and registering an exit handler.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: A pointer to the argument count, typically from the command line.
    - `argv`: A pointer to the argument vector, typically from the command line.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Set the environment variable `FD_LOG_BACKTRACE` to `0` to disable backtrace logging.
    - Call `fd_boot` with `argc` and `argv` to initialize the system.
    - Set the core log level to `3` using `fd_log_level_core_set`, which will cause the program to crash on warning logs.
    - Register the `fd_halt` function to be called at program exit using `atexit`.
    - Return `0` to indicate successful initialization.
- **Output**: Returns `0` to indicate successful initialization.

### LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput<!-- {{#callable:LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/ballet/blake3/fuzz_blake3.c#L24>)

Processes input data by hashing it twice using the BLAKE3 algorithm and verifies the consistency of the hashes.
- **Inputs**:
    - `data`: A pointer to the input data to be hashed, represented as an array of unsigned characters.
    - `size`: The size of the input data in bytes, represented as an unsigned long integer.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Cast the input `data` to a `char` pointer `msg`.
    - Declare two arrays `hash1` and `hash2` to store the hash results, each aligned to 32 bytes.
    - Declare a BLAKE3 hash state `sha`.
    - Initialize the BLAKE3 hash state `sha` and assert that the initialization is successful.
    - Append the message `msg` to the hash state `sha` and assert that the operation is successful.
    - Finalize the hash computation and store the result in `hash1`, asserting success.
    - Reinitialize the BLAKE3 hash state `sha` and assert that the initialization is successful.
    - Append the message `msg` again to the hash state `sha` and assert that the operation is successful.
    - Finalize the hash computation and store the result in `hash2`, asserting success.
    - Compare `hash1` and `hash2` to ensure they are identical, asserting that the comparison is successful.
    - Invoke `FD_FUZZ_MUST_BE_COVERED` to ensure code coverage requirements are met.
    - Return 0 to indicate successful execution.
- **Output**: Returns 0 to indicate successful execution.
- **Functions Called**:
    - [`fd_blake3_init`](<fd_blake3.c.md#fd_blake3_init>)
    - [`fd_blake3_append`](<fd_blake3.c.md#fd_blake3_append>)
    - [`fd_blake3_fini`](<fd_blake3.c.md#fd_blake3_fini>)
