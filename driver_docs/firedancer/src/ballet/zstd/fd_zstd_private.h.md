Defines a structure for Zstandard decompression streams with specific alignment and magic number.

# Purpose
This code is a C header file that defines a private structure and constants for a Zstandard decompression stream. It includes the header file `fd_zstd.h` and defines two constants: `FD_ZSTD_DSTREAM_ALIGN`, which specifies the alignment requirement for the decompression stream structure, and `FD_ZSTD_DSTREAM_MAGIC`, a magic number used for validation or identification purposes. The `fd_zstd_dstream` structure is defined with an alignment attribute to ensure it is aligned to 32 bytes. This structure contains a `magic` field for validation, a `mem_sz` field for memory size, a padding array `pad` to maintain alignment, and a flexible array member `mem` for additional memory allocation.
# Imports and Dependencies

- `fd_zstd.h`


# Data Structures

---
### fd\_zstd\_dstream
- **Type**: ``struct fd_zstd_dstream``
- **Members**:
    - ``magic``: A unique identifier for the data stream, used for validation or identification.
    - ``mem_sz``: The size of the memory allocated for the data stream.
    - ``pad``: A padding array to ensure proper memory alignment.
    - ``mem``: A flexible array member for additional memory allocation, starting at zero size.
- **Description**: Defines a data structure for a Zstandard decompression stream with specific memory alignment requirements. It includes a magic number for stream identification, a memory size indicator, padding for alignment, and a flexible array member for dynamic memory allocation.
