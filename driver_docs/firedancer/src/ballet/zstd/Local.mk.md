Makefile for adding headers, objects, and unit tests for ZSTD in the Firedancer project.

# Purpose
The makefile snippet conditionally includes and compiles components related to Zstandard (ZSTD) compression if the `FD_HAS_ZSTD` flag is defined. It adds the header file `fd_zstd.h` and the object files `fd_zstd` and `fd_util` to the build process. Additionally, it sets up and runs a unit test named `test_zstd` to verify the functionality of the ZSTD components.
