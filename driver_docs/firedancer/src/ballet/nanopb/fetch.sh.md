Fetches and modifies specific files from the nanopb repository based on a specified tag.

# Purpose
This script is a Bash executable that automates the process of downloading specific files from a remote repository. It sets up the environment by determining the script's directory and reads a repository tag from a file named `nanopb_tag.txt`. The script defines a list of files to download, which includes header and source files related to the `nanopb` library. For each file in the list, it constructs a URL using the repository URL and tag, then uses `curl` to download the file into the script's directory. After downloading, the script modifies each file to replace the `#include "pb.h"` directive with `#include "pb_firedancer.h"`.
