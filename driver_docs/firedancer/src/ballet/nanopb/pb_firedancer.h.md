Header file for configuring nanopb with specific settings and including necessary dependencies.

# Purpose
This code is a C header file that sets up preprocessor directives and includes necessary dependencies for a project using the nanopb library. It ensures that the file `pb_firedancer.h` is the only header included by checking if `PB_H_INCLUDED` is defined, and if so, it raises a compilation error. The file defines several macros: `PB_BUFFER_ONLY`, `PB_FIELD_32BIT`, and `PB_ENABLE_MALLOC`, which configure the nanopb library to use 32-bit fields and enable dynamic memory allocation. The header includes the `pb.h` file from the nanopb library and a utility header `fd_util.h` from a relative path, indicating dependencies on these files for further functionality.
