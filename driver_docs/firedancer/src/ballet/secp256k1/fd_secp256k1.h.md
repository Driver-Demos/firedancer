APIs for secp256K1 signature computations, including public key recovery from signatures.

# Purpose
This C header file defines an interface for working with secp256k1 cryptographic signatures. It includes a function prototype for [`fd_secp256k1_recover`](<#fd_secp256k1_recover>), which is used to recover a public key from a recoverable SECP256K1 signature. The function requires a message hash, a signature, and a recovery ID as inputs, and it outputs the recovered public key. The header file includes `fd_ballet_base.h` and uses macros `FD_PROTOTYPES_BEGIN` and `FD_PROTOTYPES_END` to manage the function prototypes. The file does not perform input validation, and it specifies memory requirements for the input and output parameters.

Recovers a public key from a recoverable SECP256K1 signature.
- **Description**: Use this function to recover a public key from a given SECP256K1 signature. It requires a message hash, a signature, and a recovery ID as inputs. The function writes the recovered public key to a specified memory location. Ensure that the input pointers are valid and point to the correct memory sizes: 32 bytes for the message hash, 64 bytes for the signature, and 64 bytes for the public key. The recovery ID must be between 0 and 3. The function does not perform input validation and returns the public key on success or NULL on failure.
- **Inputs**:
    - `public_key`: A pointer to a 64-byte memory region where the recovered public key will be stored. The caller must ensure this memory is allocated and writable.
    - `msg_hash`: A pointer to a 32-byte memory region containing the hash of the message. The caller must ensure this memory is allocated and readable.
    - `sig`: A pointer to a 64-byte memory region containing the recoverable signature. The caller must ensure this memory is allocated and readable.
    - `recovery_id`: An integer representing the recovery ID used in the signing process. Must be between 0 and 3. If the value is outside this range, the function returns NULL.
- **Output**: Returns a pointer to the recovered public key on success, or NULL on failure.
