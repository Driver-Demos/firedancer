Fuzz testing for secp256k1 public key recovery using LLVM's libFuzzer.

# Purpose
The code is a C source file designed for fuzz testing the `fd_secp256k1` cryptographic library, specifically focusing on the verification of digital signatures using the secp256k1 elliptic curve. It includes a preprocessor directive to ensure that the target environment supports hosted execution, indicated by the `FD_HAS_HOSTED` macro. The file includes necessary headers such as `stdio.h`, `stdlib.h`, and custom headers like `fd_util.h` and `fd_secp256k1.h` to provide utility functions and cryptographic operations.

The file defines two main functions: [`LLVMFuzzerInitialize`](<#llvmfuzzerinitialize>) and [`LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`](<#llvmfuzzertestoneinput>). The [`LLVMFuzzerInitialize`](<#llvmfuzzerinitialize>) function sets up the environment for fuzz testing by configuring logging and registering cleanup functions. The [`LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`](<#llvmfuzzertestoneinput>) function is the core of the fuzz testing process. It takes input data, interprets it as a `verification_test_t` structure containing a message, signature, and public key, and attempts to recover the public key from the signature using the `fd_secp256k1_recover` function. If the recovered public key matches the expected public key, the function triggers a trap, indicating a successful verification of the fuzz input. This setup is typical for fuzz testing frameworks, where the goal is to identify edge cases or vulnerabilities in cryptographic operations.

# Functions

---
### LLVMFuzzerInitialize<!-- {{#callable:LLVMFuzzerInitialize}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/ballet/secp256k1/fuzz_secp256k1_recover.c#L11>)

Initializes the fuzzer environment by setting environment variables, booting the system, registering an exit function, and setting the log level.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: A pointer to the argument count, typically passed to the main function.
    - `argv`: A pointer to the argument vector, typically passed to the main function.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Set the environment variable `FD_LOG_BACKTRACE` to `0` to disable backtraces in logs.
    - Call `fd_boot` with `argc` and `argv` to initialize the system.
    - Register `fd_halt` to be called on program exit using `atexit`.
    - Set the core log level to `3` using `fd_log_level_core_set`, which causes the program to crash on warning logs.
    - Return `0` to indicate successful initialization.
- **Output**: Returns `0` to indicate successful initialization.


---
### LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput<!-- {{#callable:LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/ballet/secp256k1/fuzz_secp256k1_recover.c#L29>)

Tests if the input data can be used to successfully verify a secp256k1 signature and triggers a trap if verification succeeds.
- **Inputs**:
    - `data`: A pointer to the input data, expected to be a byte array representing a `verification_test_t` structure.
    - `size`: The size of the input data in bytes.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Check if `size` is less than the size of `verification_test_t`; if true, return -1.
    - Cast `data` to a `verification_test_t` pointer named `test`.
    - Initialize a 64-byte array `_pub` to store the recovered public key.
    - Iterate over `recid` from 0 to 3 to attempt recovery of the public key using [`fd_secp256k1_recover`](<fd_secp256k1.c.md#fd_secp256k1_recover>).
    - If [`fd_secp256k1_recover`](<fd_secp256k1.c.md#fd_secp256k1_recover>) returns a non-NULL result and the recovered public key matches `test->pub`, trigger a trap using `__builtin_trap()`.
    - Return 0 if no trap is triggered.
- **Output**: Returns -1 if the input size is insufficient; otherwise, returns 0 unless a trap is triggered.
- **Functions Called**:
    - [`fd_secp256k1_recover`](<fd_secp256k1.c.md#fd_secp256k1_recover>)
