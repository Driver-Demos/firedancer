Makefile for building and testing secp256k1 components with conditional library checks.

# Purpose
The content is a Makefile segment that conditionally includes and tests the `secp256k1` cryptographic library. If the `FD_HAS_SECP256K1` flag is defined, it adds the header `fd_secp256k1.h` and the object files `fd_secp256k1` and `fd_ballet`. It also sets up a unit test `test_secp256k1` and a fuzz test `fuzz_secp256k1_recover`, linking them with `fd_ballet`, `fd_util`, and any libraries specified in `SECP256K1_LIBS`. The unit test `test_secp256k1` is then executed. If the flag is not defined, a warning is issued indicating that `secp256k1` is disabled due to the absence of `libsecp256k1`.
