Defines a 256-bit unsigned integer type with functions for byte swapping, comparison, and bit access.

# Purpose
The code defines a C header file that provides functionality for handling 256-bit unsigned integers, referred to as `fd_uint256_t`. This is achieved through a union that represents a 256-bit integer as either an array of four `ulong` values or a buffer of 32 bytes. The code includes macros and functions to ensure proper alignment and efficient storage of these integers, particularly in environments with different alignment requirements.

The header file includes several inline functions for operations on `fd_uint256_t` types. These functions include [`fd_uint256_bswap`](<#fd_uint256_bswap>), which swaps the byte order of a 256-bit integer to facilitate conversions between little and big endian formats; [`fd_uint256_eq`](<#fd_uint256_eq>), which checks for equality between two 256-bit integers; [`fd_uint256_cmp`](<#fd_uint256_cmp>), which compares two 256-bit integers and returns a comparison result; and [`fd_uint256_bit`](<#fd_uint256_bit>), which retrieves the value of a specific bit within a 256-bit integer. The file also includes another header, `fd_uint256_mul.h`, which suggests additional multiplication-related functionality for `fd_uint256_t` types.

# Data Structures

---
### fd\_uint256\_t
- **Type**: `union`
- **Members**:
    - ``limbs``: An array of 4 unsigned long integers representing the 256-bit integer.
    - ``buf``: A buffer of 32 unsigned characters representing the 256-bit integer.
- **Description**: Represents a 256-bit unsigned integer using a union that can be accessed as either an array of four 64-bit unsigned long integers or a buffer of 32 bytes. This structure is aligned to 32 bytes to optimize space usage in memory, especially when used in arrays or structures. It is designed to facilitate operations on 256-bit integers, such as byte swapping for endianness conversion, equality comparison, and bit manipulation.


# Functions

---
### fd\_uint256\_bswap<!-- {{#callable:fd_uint256_bswap}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/ballet/bigint/fd_uint256.h#L31>)

Swaps the byte order of a 256-bit unsigned integer.
- **Inputs**:
    - ``r``: A pointer to a `fd_uint256_t` structure where the result will be stored.
    - ``a``: A pointer to a constant `fd_uint256_t` structure whose byte order will be swapped.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Call `fd_ulong_bswap` on each of the four `ulong` elements in the `limbs` array of `a` to swap their byte order.
    - Store the swapped values in reverse order in the `limbs` array of `r`.
    - Return the pointer `r`.
- **Output**: A pointer to the `fd_uint256_t` structure `r` with the byte order of its elements swapped.


---
### fd\_uint256\_eq<!-- {{#callable:fd_uint256_eq}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/ballet/bigint/fd_uint256.h#L46>)

Compares two `fd_uint256_t` values for equality.
- **Inputs**:
    - `a`: A pointer to the first `fd_uint256_t` value to compare.
    - `b`: A pointer to the second `fd_uint256_t` value to compare.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Compares each of the four `limbs` of `a` and `b` for equality.
    - Returns 1 if all corresponding `limbs` are equal.
    - Returns 0 if any corresponding `limbs` are not equal.
- **Output**: Returns an integer: 1 if `a` and `b` are equal, 0 otherwise.


---
### fd\_uint256\_cmp<!-- {{#callable:fd_uint256_cmp}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/ballet/bigint/fd_uint256.h#L56>)

Compares two `fd_uint256_t` values and returns 0 if they are equal, -1 if the first is less, and 1 if the first is greater.
- **Inputs**:
    - `a`: A pointer to the first `fd_uint256_t` value to compare.
    - `b`: A pointer to the second `fd_uint256_t` value to compare.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Iterates over the `limbs` array of the `fd_uint256_t` structures from the most significant limb (index 3) to the least significant limb (index 0).
    - Checks if the current limb of `a` is not equal to the corresponding limb of `b`.
    - If a difference is found, returns 1 if the limb of `a` is greater than the limb of `b`, otherwise returns -1.
    - If no differences are found after checking all limbs, returns 0.
- **Output**: An integer indicating the comparison result: 0 if `a` equals `b`, -1 if `a` is less than `b`, and 1 if `a` is greater than `b`.

### fd\_uint256\_bit<!-- {{#callable:fd_uint256_bit}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/ballet/bigint/fd_uint256.h#L69>)

Retrieves the value of the i-th bit from a 256-bit unsigned integer.
- **Inputs**:
    - ``a``: A pointer to a `fd_uint256_t` structure representing a 256-bit unsigned integer.
    - ``i``: An integer representing the bit position to retrieve, where 0 is the least significant bit.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Calculate the index of the limb containing the i-th bit by dividing `i` by 64.
    - Calculate the bit position within the limb by taking `i` modulo 64.
    - Retrieve the limb from the `limbs` array using the calculated index.
    - Perform a bitwise AND operation between the limb and a bitmask with a single bit set at the calculated position.
    - Return the result of the bitwise AND operation, which is either 0 or a non-zero value indicating the presence of the bit.
- **Output**: The function returns an `ulong` that is either 0 or a non-zero value, indicating whether the i-th bit is set.
