Makefile for building and testing ChaCha and ChaCha-RNG components with optional SSE and AVX support.

# Purpose
The Makefile content configures the build process for the ChaCha cryptographic functions and their associated random number generator (RNG) support. It includes conditional compilation directives to add headers and object files based on the availability of specific CPU instruction sets, such as SSE, AVX, and AVX512. The `add-hdrs` and `add-objs` functions are used to include the necessary header and object files for both the base ChaCha and ChaCha-RNG functionalities. Additionally, the file defines unit tests for these components using `make-unit-test` and executes them with `run-unit-test` to ensure the correctness of the implementations.
