Defines constants and functions for the ChaCha20 block cipher, including block and key sizes.

# Purpose
This C header file defines constants and function prototypes related to the ChaCha20 encryption algorithm. It specifies the size of the ChaCha20 block (`FD_CHACHA_BLOCK_SZ`) as 64 bytes and the size of the encryption key (`FD_CHACHA20_KEY_SZ`) as 32 bytes. The file declares two functions, [`fd_chacha8_block`](<#fd_chacha8_block>) and [`fd_chacha20_block`](<#fd_chacha20_block>), which are intended to perform the ChaCha20 block function. These functions take pointers to an output block, an encryption key, and a block index with a nonce. The header includes a note that encryption and decryption functions are not implemented, as they are not currently required.
