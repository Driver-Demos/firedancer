Tests and benchmarks the `fd_chacha20_block` function using a test vector from IETF RFC 7539.

# Purpose
The code is a C program that tests and benchmarks the `fd_chacha20_block` function, which is part of a cryptographic library. The program includes two main functions: `test_chacha20_block` and `bench_chacha20_block`. The `test_chacha20_block` function verifies the correctness of the `fd_chacha20_block` function by comparing its output against a known test vector from the IETF RFC 7539. It uses a predefined key and nonce to generate a block of data and checks if the output matches the expected result. If the output does not match, it logs an error message.

The `bench_chacha20_block` function measures the performance of the `fd_chacha20_block` function. It first performs a warm-up loop to prepare the system, then executes the function multiple times to calculate the throughput in gigabits per second and the time per byte in nanoseconds. The [`main`](<#main>) function initializes the environment, calls the test and benchmark functions, and logs a success message if the test passes. The program uses logging functions such as `FD_LOG_ERR` and `FD_LOG_NOTICE` to report errors and performance metrics.

Initializes the environment, runs tests and benchmarks for the ChaCha20 block function, logs the results, and then halts the program.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments passed to the program.
    - `argv`: An array of strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Calls `fd_boot` to initialize the environment with command-line arguments.
    - Executes `test_chacha20_block` to verify the ChaCha20 block function against a known test vector.
    - Executes `bench_chacha20_block` to benchmark the performance of the ChaCha20 block function.
    - Logs a notice message indicating the tests passed.
    - Calls `fd_halt` to clean up and terminate the program.
- **Output**: Returns 0 to indicate successful execution.
