SHA-1 hash function implementation with data pre-processing and main loop logic.

# Purpose
The code implements the SHA-1 hashing algorithm, which is a cryptographic hash function. The function [`fd_sha1_hash`](<#fd_sha1_hash>) takes an input data buffer and its length, processes the data according to the SHA-1 specification, and produces a 160-bit hash value. The function uses a series of bitwise operations and logical functions to transform the input data into a fixed-size hash. The algorithm involves initializing a set of hash values, processing the data in 512-bit chunks, and performing a series of operations to update the hash values. The final hash is stored in the provided `hash` buffer.

The code includes pre-processing steps such as padding the input data to ensure it is a multiple of 512 bits and appending the original message length. It defines a main loop that processes each 512-bit chunk, extending it into 80 32-bit words, and iteratively updating the hash values using bitwise operations and constants. The function returns the computed hash, which is useful for verifying data integrity and authenticity. The code is a modified version of the teeny SHA-1 library, as noted in the comments, and is intended to be used as part of a larger application or library that requires SHA-1 hashing functionality.

### fd\_sha1\_hash<!-- {{#callable:fd_sha1_hash}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/ballet/sha1/fd_sha1.c#L6>)

Computes the SHA-1 hash of the input data.
- **Inputs**:
    - `data`: A pointer to the input data to hash.
    - `data_len`: The length of the input data in bytes.
    - `hash`: A pointer to a buffer where the resulting SHA-1 hash will be stored.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Initialize the `W` array and the `H` array with predefined constants.
    - Calculate the number of bits in the input data and determine the number of 512-bit chunks needed.
    - Prepare the data tail with padding and the length of the message in bits.
    - Iterate over each 512-bit chunk, processing it into 80 32-bit words in `W`.
    - Extend the first 16 words in `W` to 80 words using bitwise operations and rotations.
    - Initialize working variables `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `e` with the values from `H`.
    - Perform the main loop of 80 iterations, updating the working variables using SHA-1 specific functions and constants.
    - Update the `H` array with the results from the working variables.
    - Convert the final `H` values into the output hash in big-endian format.
- **Output**: A pointer to the buffer containing the computed SHA-1 hash.
