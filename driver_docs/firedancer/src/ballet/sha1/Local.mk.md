Makefile for adding headers, objects, and unit tests for SHA1 in the firedancer codebase.

# Purpose
The content is a Makefile script that manages the build process for a software project. It adds the header file `fd_sha1.h` and object files `fd_sha1` and `fd_ballet` to the build. It also defines a unit test named `test_sha1`, which depends on the `fd_ballet` and `fd_util` components. Finally, it runs the `test_sha1` unit test to verify the functionality of the code.
