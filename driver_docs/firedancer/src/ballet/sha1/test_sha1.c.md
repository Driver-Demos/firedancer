Tests the SHA-1 hash function implementation with predefined input and output pairs.

# Purpose
The code is a test suite for verifying the functionality of the SHA-1 hashing algorithm. It includes the `fd_sha1_hash` function from the `fd_sha1.h` header file to compute SHA-1 hashes for a set of predefined input strings. The code compares the computed hash values against expected hash outputs to ensure correctness. The test inputs include various strings, such as "abc" and "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog", which are common test cases for hash functions.

The program initializes by calling `fd_boot` and concludes with `fd_halt`, which are likely functions for setting up and tearing down the test environment. The main loop iterates over the input strings, computes their SHA-1 hashes, and formats the results into hexadecimal strings. It uses `fd_cstr_printf_check` to format the hash and `FD_TEST` to assert that the computed hash matches the expected output. If all tests pass, the program logs a "pass" message and exits successfully. This code is intended to be executed as a standalone program to validate the SHA-1 implementation.

Executes SHA-1 hashing on predefined input strings and verifies the results against expected output hashes.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments.
    - `argv`: The array of command-line arguments.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Calls `fd_boot` to initialize the environment with command-line arguments.
    - Defines two arrays, `inputs` and `outputs`, containing test strings and their expected SHA-1 hash results respectively.
    - Iterates over each input string, computes its SHA-1 hash using [`fd_sha1_hash`](<fd_sha1.c.md#fd_sha1_hash>), and stores the result in `digest`.
    - Converts the `digest` to a hexadecimal string `hexdigest` using `fd_cstr_printf_check` and byte-swapping with `fd_uint_bswap`.
    - Compares `hexdigest` with the expected hash in `outputs` using `FD_TEST` to ensure correctness.
    - Logs a notice message "pass" if all tests succeed.
    - Calls `fd_halt` to terminate the program.
- **Output**: Returns 0 to indicate successful execution.
- **Functions Called**:
    - [`fd_sha1_hash`](<fd_sha1.c.md#fd_sha1_hash>)
