Defines the `fd_fec_set` structure for managing data and parity shreds in FEC sets.

# Purpose
This C header file defines structures and macros for managing Forward Error Correction (FEC) sets, which are used in data transmission processes involving Merkle shreds. It includes the `fd_reedsol.h` header for Reed-Solomon error correction capabilities and utilizes a template file `fd_set.c` to define sets for received data and parity shreds, with maximum sizes specified by `FD_REEDSOL_DATA_SHREDS_MAX` and `FD_REEDSOL_PARITY_SHREDS_MAX`. The `fd_fec_set` structure contains counters for data and parity shreds, arrays to track received shreds, and pointers to the actual data and parity shreds. This setup is essential for constructing and validating FEC sets, which must be complete before transmission or validation can occur.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `../reedsol/fd_reedsol.h`
- `../../util/tmpl/fd_set.c`


# Data Structures

---
### fd\_shred\_t
- **Type**: ``fd_shred_t``
- **Description**: `fd_shred_t` is a typedef for a forward-declared structure `fd_shred`, which is not defined in the provided code. It serves as a placeholder for a data structure that is likely defined elsewhere in the codebase.


---
### fd\_fec\_set
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `data_shred_cnt`: Counts the number of data shreds.
    - `parity_shred_cnt`: Counts the number of parity shreds.
    - `data_shred_rcvd`: Stores received data shreds in an array of type `d_rcvd_t`.
    - `parity_shred_rcvd`: Stores received parity shreds in an array of type `p_rcvd_t`.
    - `data_shreds`: Holds pointers to data shreds with a maximum defined by `FD_REEDSOL_DATA_SHREDS_MAX`.
    - `parity_shreds`: Holds pointers to parity shreds with a maximum defined by `FD_REEDSOL_PARITY_SHREDS_MAX`.
- **Description**: Defines a Forward Error Correction (FEC) set used in the context of Merkle shreds, which includes counts and arrays for both data and parity shreds, facilitating the transmission and validation of data packets.

### fd\_fec\_set\_t
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `data_shred_cnt`: Counts the number of data shreds in the FEC set.
    - `parity_shred_cnt`: Counts the number of parity shreds in the FEC set.
    - `data_shred_rcvd`: Stores the received status of data shreds using `d_rcvd_t`.
    - `parity_shred_rcvd`: Stores the received status of parity shreds using `p_rcvd_t`.
    - `data_shreds`: Holds pointers to data shreds with a maximum defined by `FD_REEDSOL_DATA_SHREDS_MAX`.
    - `parity_shreds`: Holds pointers to parity shreds with a maximum defined by `FD_REEDSOL_PARITY_SHREDS_MAX`.
- **Description**: Represents a Forward Error Correction (FEC) set used in transmission, where it is necessary to construct the entire set before sending or validating it. The structure includes counters for data and parity shreds, arrays to track received shreds, and pointers to the actual data and parity shreds.
