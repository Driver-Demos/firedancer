APIs for authenticated AES-GCM encryption and decryption, compatible with TLS 1.3 and QUIC.

# Purpose
The code defines a C header file for implementing AES-GCM (Galois/Counter Mode) encryption, which is a mode of operation for cryptographic block ciphers. It provides authenticated encryption, ensuring both confidentiality and integrity of the data. The file includes APIs for encrypting and decrypting messages using AES-GCM, compatible with protocols like TLS 1.3 and QUIC. The code supports an "all-in-one" API, where the entire plaintext is processed in a single call, and it may evolve to support more complex operations in the future. The file also includes structures and definitions for different backend implementations, such as AES-NI and AVX10, which optimize the encryption process based on the available hardware capabilities.

The header file defines several key components, including structures for managing encryption keys and states (`fd_aes_gcm_aesni_key_t`, `fd_aes_gcm_aesni_t`, and `fd_aes_gcm_avx10_t`). It also includes macros for selecting the appropriate backend implementation based on the hardware features available (`FD_AES_GCM_IMPL`). The public API functions [`fd_aes_128_gcm_init`](<#fd_aes_128_gcm_init>), [`fd_aes_gcm_encrypt`](<#fd_aes_gcm_encrypt>), and [`fd_aes_gcm_decrypt`](<#fd_aes_gcm_decrypt>) are provided for initializing the encryption state, encrypting plaintext, and decrypting ciphertext, respectively. The file specifies alignment and size requirements for the encryption state and authentication tags, ensuring compatibility across different architectures.
