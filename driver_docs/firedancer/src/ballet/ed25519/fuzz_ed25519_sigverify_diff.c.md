Fuzz testing for verifying and signing ED25519 signatures using C and Rust implementations.

# Purpose
The code is a fuzz testing suite for verifying the interoperability and correctness of Ed25519 cryptographic operations between C and Rust implementations. It uses dynamic linking to load functions from a Rust library (`libdalek_target.so`) that implements Ed25519 signing and verification. The code defines function pointers `verify_fn` and `sign_fn` to interface with the Rust functions `ed25519_dalek_verify` and `ed25519_dalek_sign`, respectively. The [`LLVMFuzzerInitialize`](<#llvmfuzzerinitialize>) function sets up the environment by configuring logging and loading the Rust library functions. 

The [`LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`](<#llvmfuzzertestoneinput>) function is the main test function that takes input data, interprets it as a `verification_test_t` structure, and performs several tests. It checks that both C and Rust implementations produce the same signature for a given message and private key, and that both can verify the signature correctly. It also tests that both implementations return the same result when verifying a random signature. The code uses assertions to ensure that the results are consistent, and it logs critical errors if any dynamic linking operations fail.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `assert.h`
- `dlfcn.h`
- `stdio.h`
- `stdlib.h`
- `../../util/fd_util.h`
- `../../util/sanitize/fd_fuzz.h`
- `fd_ed25519.h`


# Global Variables

---
### verify\_fn
- **Type**: `union`
- **Description**: A static union that contains a function pointer `fn` of type `verify_fn_t` and a generic pointer `ptr`. The `verify_fn_t` is a function pointer type that points to a function used for verifying digital signatures.
- **Use**: Used to dynamically load and store the address of the `ed25519_dalek_verify` function from a shared library at runtime.


---
### sign\_fn
- **Type**: `union`
- **Description**: A static union that contains a function pointer of type `sign_fn_t` and a void pointer. The `sign_fn_t` is a function pointer type for a function that signs a message using the Ed25519 algorithm.
- **Use**: Used to dynamically load and store the address of the `ed25519_dalek_sign` function from a shared library at runtime.


# Data Structures

---
### verification\_test
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `prv`: An array of 32 unsigned characters representing the private key.
    - `sig`: An array of 64 unsigned characters representing the signature.
    - `msg`: A flexible array member representing the message to be signed or verified.
- **Description**: Holds data for a cryptographic verification test, including a private key, a signature, and a message.

### verification\_test\_t
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - ``prv``: An array of 32 unsigned characters representing the private key.
    - ``sig``: An array of 64 unsigned characters representing the signature.
    - ``msg``: A flexible array member representing the message to be signed or verified.
- **Description**: Represents a test case for verifying digital signatures using the Ed25519 algorithm, containing a private key, a signature, and a message.


# Functions

---
### LLVMFuzzerInitialize<!-- {{#callable:LLVMFuzzerInitialize}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/ballet/ed25519/fuzz_ed25519_sigverify_diff.c#L38>)

Initializes the fuzzer environment by setting up logging, loading a shared library, and resolving function pointers for cryptographic operations.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: A pointer to the argument count, typically passed to the main function.
    - `argv`: A pointer to the argument vector, typically passed to the main function.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Sets the environment variable `FD_LOG_BACKTRACE` to `0` to disable backtraces in logs.
    - Calls `fd_boot` with `argc` and `argv` to initialize the environment.
    - Registers `fd_halt` to be called at program exit using `atexit`.
    - Sets the log level to crash on warnings using `fd_log_level_core_set(3)`.
    - Attempts to load the shared library `libdalek_target.so` using `dlopen`.
    - If the library fails to load, logs a critical error with `FD_LOG_CRIT`.
    - Resolves the `ed25519_dalek_verify` function from the library using `dlsym`.
    - If the function pointer is not found, logs a critical error with `FD_LOG_CRIT`.
    - Resolves the `ed25519_dalek_sign` function from the library using `dlsym`.
    - If the function pointer is not found, logs a critical error with `FD_LOG_CRIT`.
- **Output**: Returns `0` to indicate successful initialization.

### LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput<!-- {{#callable:LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/ballet/ed25519/fuzz_ed25519_sigverify_diff.c#L69>)

Tests the consistency of signature creation and verification between C and Rust implementations using the Ed25519 algorithm.
- **Inputs**:
    - `data`: A pointer to an array of unsigned characters representing the input data, which includes a private key, a signature, and a message.
    - `size`: The size of the input data in bytes.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Check if the input size is less than 96 bytes; if so, return -1.
    - Cast the input data to a `verification_test_t` structure and calculate the message size by subtracting 96 from the total size.
    - Initialize a SHA-512 context for hashing operations.
    - Generate a public key from the private key using the SHA-512 context.
    - Create signatures using both C and Rust implementations and compare them for equality.
    - Verify the generated signatures using both C and Rust implementations and ensure both succeed.
    - Verify a random signature using both C and Rust implementations and ensure both return the same result.
    - Return 0 to indicate successful execution.
- **Output**: Returns 0 if the tests pass successfully, otherwise returns -1 if the input size is insufficient.
- **Functions Called**:
    - [`fd_ed25519_verify`](<fd_ed25519_user.c.md#fd_ed25519_verify>)
