Fuzz testing for ED25519 signature verification using LLVM's libFuzzer.

# Purpose
The code is a fuzz testing suite for the `fd_ed25519` cryptographic library, specifically targeting the Ed25519 digital signature algorithm. It is designed to be used with LLVM's libFuzzer, a coverage-guided fuzzing engine. The code includes the [`LLVMFuzzerInitialize`](<#llvmfuzzerinitialize>) function, which sets up the environment by disabling signal handlers, initializing the logging system, and setting the log level to crash on warnings. The [`LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`](<#llvmfuzzertestoneinput>) function is the main entry point for the fuzzing process. It takes a data buffer and its size as input, checks if the size is sufficient, and then performs operations to test the Ed25519 signature generation and verification.

The code defines a `signature_test_t` structure to hold a private key and a message. It uses the `fd_ed25519_public_from_private` function to derive a public key from the private key and the `fd_ed25519_sign` function to generate a signature for the message. The signature is then verified using the `fd_ed25519_verify` function. Assertions ensure that the signature generation and verification processes are correct. The code also includes a macro `FD_FUZZ_MUST_BE_COVERED` to ensure that all code paths are exercised during fuzzing. The inclusion of headers like `fd_util.h` and `fd_fuzz.h` suggests that the code relies on utility functions and fuzzing support from the broader framework.

# Functions

---
### LLVMFuzzerInitialize<!-- {{#callable:LLVMFuzzerInitialize}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/ballet/ed25519/fuzz_ed25519_sigverify.c#L13>)

Initializes the fuzzer environment by setting environment variables, booting the framework, registering an exit function, and configuring log levels.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: A pointer to the argument count, typically from the command line.
    - `argv`: A pointer to the argument vector, typically from the command line.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Set the environment variable `FD_LOG_BACKTRACE` to `0` to disable backtraces in logs.
    - Call `fd_boot` with `argc` and `argv` to initialize the framework.
    - Register `fd_halt` to be called on program exit using `atexit`.
    - Set the core log level to `3` using `fd_log_level_core_set`, which causes the program to crash on warning logs.
    - Return `0` to indicate successful initialization.
- **Output**: Returns `0` to indicate successful initialization.

### LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput<!-- {{#callable:LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/ballet/ed25519/fuzz_ed25519_sigverify.c#L30>)

Processes input data to test the signing and verification of messages using the Ed25519 algorithm.
- **Inputs**:
    - `data`: A pointer to an array of unsigned characters representing the input data, which includes a private key and a message.
    - `size`: The size of the input data in bytes.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Check if the size of the input data is less than 32 bytes; if so, return -1.
    - Cast the input data to a `signature_test_t` structure to access the private key and message.
    - Calculate the size of the message by subtracting 32 from the total size.
    - Initialize a SHA-512 context for hashing operations.
    - Generate a public key from the private key using the SHA-512 context.
    - Sign the message using the private key and public key, storing the result in `sig`.
    - Compare the generated signature with the expected result to ensure they match.
    - Verify the signature using the public key and message, asserting that the verification is successful.
    - Ensure that all code paths are covered by fuzz testing.
    - Return 0 to indicate successful processing.
- **Output**: Returns 0 if the input data is processed successfully and all assertions pass; returns -1 if the input size is less than 32 bytes.
- **Functions Called**:
    - [`fd_ed25519_verify`](<fd_ed25519_user.c.md#fd_ed25519_verify>)
