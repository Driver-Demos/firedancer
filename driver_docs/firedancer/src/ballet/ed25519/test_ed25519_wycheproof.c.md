Test cases for verifying Ed25519 signatures using Wycheproof test vectors.

# Purpose
The code defines a data structure and a static array of test cases for verifying Ed25519 digital signatures using the Wycheproof test suite. The `fd_ed25519_verify_wycheproof` structure contains fields for a comment, message, message size, public key, signature, test case ID, and a boolean indicating if the test case is expected to pass. The array `ed25519_verify_wycheproofs` is initialized with multiple test cases, each containing specific values for these fields. These test cases are used to validate the correctness of Ed25519 signature verification by providing known inputs and expected outcomes.

The file is intended to be included in a larger project, as indicated by the inclusion of a header file `fd_ballet_base.h`. The code is generated automatically, as noted by the comments at the top, and should not be edited manually. The test cases cover a range of scenarios, including valid signatures, invalid signatures, and edge cases such as special values for the signature components. The array is terminated with a zero-initialized structure to indicate the end of the test cases. This setup is typically used in cryptographic libraries to ensure the implementation's compliance with expected behavior and to detect any potential vulnerabilities or errors in the signature verification process.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `../fd_ballet_base.h`


# Global Variables

---
### ed25519\_verify\_wycheproofs
- **Type**: ``fd_ed25519_verify_wycheproof_t const[]``
- **Description**: An array of `fd_ed25519_verify_wycheproof_t` structures, each containing test case data for verifying Ed25519 signatures. Each element includes a test case ID, a comment, a message, the size of the message, a public key, a signature, and a boolean indicating if the test case is expected to pass.
- **Use**: Used to store and access test cases for Ed25519 signature verification.


# Data Structures

---
### fd\_ed25519\_verify\_wycheproof
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `comment`: A pointer to a constant character string that contains a comment.
    - `msg`: A pointer to a constant unsigned character array that contains the message to verify.
    - `msg_sz`: An unsigned long integer that specifies the size of the message.
    - `pub`: An array of 32 unsigned characters that contains the public key.
    - `sig`: An array of 64 unsigned characters that contains the signature.
    - `tc_id`: An unsigned integer that identifies the test case.
    - `ok`: An integer that indicates if the verification is successful (1) or not (0).
- **Description**: Defines a structure for storing test vectors used in Ed25519 signature verification, including the message, its size, the public key, the signature, a test case identifier, a comment, and a flag indicating the success of the verification.
