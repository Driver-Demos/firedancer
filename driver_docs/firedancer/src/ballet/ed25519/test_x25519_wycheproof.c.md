Verifies X25519 key exchange using Wycheproof test vectors with structures for test data and results.

# Purpose
The code is a collection of test cases designed to verify the X25519 key exchange algorithm using test vectors from the Wycheproof project. Each test case is represented by a structure `fd_x25519_verify_wycheproof_t`, which includes fields such as `tc_id` for test case identifiers, `comment` for descriptions, `shared` for expected shared secrets, `prv` for private keys, `pub` for public keys, and `ok` for indicating expected outcomes. The test cases cover various scenarios, including normal, edge, and special cases, to ensure the correctness of the X25519 implementation. The `ok` field helps verify if the computed shared secret matches the expected value, aiding developers in identifying and fixing potential issues in cryptographic implementations. This code is intended for use in testing environments and does not define public APIs or external interfaces.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `../fd_ballet_base.h`


# Global Variables

---
### x25519\_verify\_wycheproofs
- **Type**: ``fd_x25519_verify_wycheproof_t[]``
- **Description**: An array of `fd_x25519_verify_wycheproof_t` structures, each containing test case data for verifying X25519 key exchange operations against known test vectors. Each element in the array includes fields such as `tc_id`, `comment`, `shared`, `prv`, `pub`, and `ok`, which represent the test case ID, a comment describing the test case, the expected shared secret, the private key, the public key, and a flag indicating if the test case is expected to pass, respectively.
- **Use**: Used to store and verify test cases for X25519 key exchange operations against known test vectors.


# Data Structures

---
### fd\_x25519\_verify\_wycheproof
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `comment`: A pointer to a constant character string that contains a comment.
    - `shared`: An array of 32 unsigned characters that stores the shared secret.
    - `prv`: An array of 32 unsigned characters that stores the private key.
    - `pub`: An array of 32 unsigned characters that stores the public key.
    - `tc_id`: An unsigned integer that stores the test case identifier.
    - `ok`: An integer that indicates the success or failure of the verification.
- **Description**: Represents a data structure used for verifying X25519 key exchange test vectors, containing fields for comments, shared secrets, private and public keys, test case identifiers, and verification results.


---
### fd\_x25519\_verify\_wycheproof\_t
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Description**: The `fd_x25519_verify_wycheproof_t` is a typedef for a `struct` named `fd_x25519_verify_wycheproof`. The code does not provide details about the members of this `struct`, so further information is needed to understand its purpose and usage.
