API for X25519 ECDH key exchange, including key and shared secret derivation functions.

# Purpose
This C header file defines an API for performing X25519 Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key exchange, as specified in RFC 7748 Section 5. It provides functionality for key derivation and shared secret computation between two parties. The [`fd_x25519_public`](<#fd_x25519_public>) function generates a public key from a 32-byte private key, which can be shared with a peer. The `fd_x25519_exchange` function computes a shared secret using a private key and a peer's public key, ensuring secure communication without revealing the private keys. The file includes necessary definitions and prototypes to facilitate secure key exchange operations.
