APIs for ED25519 signature computations, including key generation, signing, verification, and error handling.

# Purpose
The code is a C header file that defines the interface for ED25519 signature computations. It provides a set of APIs for generating and verifying digital signatures using the ED25519 algorithm, which is known for its high security and performance. The file includes function prototypes for key operations such as [`fd_ed25519_public_from_private`](<#fd_ed25519_public_from_private>), which computes a public key from a given private key, `fd_ed25519_sign`, which signs a message, and [`fd_ed25519_verify`](<#fd_ed25519_verify>), which verifies a message's signature. Additionally, it includes a function for batch verification of signatures over a single message, [`fd_ed25519_verify_batch_single_msg`](<#fd_ed25519_verify_batch_single_msg>), and a utility function [`fd_ed25519_strerror`](<#fd_ed25519_strerror>) to convert error codes into human-readable strings.

The header file also defines several constants and types used in the ED25519 operations. These include error codes like `FD_ED25519_SUCCESS`, `FD_ED25519_ERR_SIG`, `FD_ED25519_ERR_PUBKEY`, and `FD_ED25519_ERR_MSG`, which indicate the success or failure of operations, and `FD_ED25519_SIG_SZ`, which specifies the size of an ED25519 signature. The type `fd_ed25519_sig_t` is defined as an array to hold a signature. The file includes the `fd_sha512.h` header, indicating a dependency on SHA-512 hashing for its operations. The functions are designed to be sensitive to security, as indicated by the use of `FD_FN_SENSITIVE`, and they sanitize inputs to minimize the risk of leaking private key information.

Verifies a message signature using the Ed25519 standard.
- **Description**: Use this function to verify the authenticity of a message by checking its signature against a given public key using the Ed25519 standard. This function requires a SHA-512 context for hashing operations. It returns a success code if the signature is valid or an error code if the signature, public key, or message is invalid. Ensure that the message, signature, and public key are correctly formatted and that the SHA-512 context is properly initialized before calling this function.
- **Inputs**:
    - `msg`: A pointer to the first byte of the message to verify. The message can be of any size, including zero. If the size is zero, the pointer can be NULL.
    - `msg_sz`: The size of the message in bytes. It can be zero if the message is empty.
    - `sig`: A pointer to a 64-byte memory region containing the signature of the message. This must not be NULL.
    - `public_key`: A pointer to a 32-byte memory region containing the public key used to verify the message. This must not be NULL.
    - `sha`: A handle to a SHA-512 context used for hashing during verification. This must be properly initialized before use.
- **Output**: Returns FD_ED25519_SUCCESS (0) if the signature is valid. Returns an error code (FD_ED25519_ERR_SIG, FD_ED25519_ERR_PUBKEY, or FD_ED25519_ERR_MSG) if the signature, public key, or message is invalid.
- **See Also**: [`fd_ed25519_verify`](<fd_ed25519_user.c.md#fd_ed25519_verify>)  (Implementation)

[View Source →](<../../../../../src/ballet/ed25519/fd_ed25519.h#L124>)

Verifies a batch of ED25519 signatures for a single message.
- **Description**: Use this function to verify multiple ED25519 signatures against a single message. It is useful when you have a batch of signatures and public keys that need verification for the same message. The function requires that the batch size is greater than zero and does not exceed a predefined maximum. If the batch size is invalid, the function returns an error code. The function processes each signature and public key pair, using SHA-512 calculators for hashing operations. It returns a success code if all signatures are valid, or an error code indicating the type of failure if any signature is invalid.
- **Inputs**:
    - `msg`: Pointer to the message to verify. The message size is given by `msg_sz`. It can be null if `msg_sz` is zero.
    - `msg_sz`: Size of the message in bytes. Can be zero, in which case `msg` can be null.
    - `signatures`: Pointer to the memory region holding the signatures. Each signature is 64 bytes long. The array must have at least `64 * batch_sz` bytes.
    - `pubkeys`: Pointer to the memory region holding the public keys. Each public key is 32 bytes long. The array must have at least `32 * batch_sz` bytes.
    - `shas`: Array of pointers to SHA-512 calculators. The array must have at least `batch_sz` elements.
    - `batch_sz`: Number of signatures, public keys, and SHA-512 calculators. Must be greater than zero and not exceed a predefined maximum.
- **Output**: Returns `FD_ED25519_SUCCESS` if all signatures are valid. Returns an error code (`FD_ED25519_ERR_SIG`, `FD_ED25519_ERR_PUBKEY`, or `FD_ED25519_ERR_MSG`) if any signature is invalid.
- **See Also**: [`fd_ed25519_verify_batch_single_msg`](<fd_ed25519_user.c.md#fd_ed25519_verify_batch_single_msg>)  (Implementation)

Converts an error code to a human-readable string.
- **Description**: Use this function to obtain a human-readable description of an error code returned by other `fd_ed25519` functions. This can help in debugging or logging by providing a clear text representation of the error. The function returns a constant string that describes the error associated with the given code. The returned string is always valid and non-null, and its lifetime is infinite, meaning it does not need to be freed or managed by the caller.
- **Inputs**:
    - `err`: An integer representing an error code, typically returned by `fd_ed25519` functions. Valid values include `FD_ED25519_SUCCESS`, `FD_ED25519_ERR_SIG`, `FD_ED25519_ERR_PUBKEY`, and `FD_ED25519_ERR_MSG`. If an unknown error code is provided, the function returns "unknown".
- **Output**: A constant character pointer to a string describing the error. The string is non-null and has an infinite lifetime.
- **See Also**: [`fd_ed25519_strerror`](<fd_ed25519_user.c.md#fd_ed25519_strerror>)  (Implementation)
