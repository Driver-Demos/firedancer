Tests Ed25519 signature malleability using predefined pass and fail binary data.

# Purpose
The code is an executable C program designed to test the malleability of Ed25519 digital signatures. It imports binary data from two files, `test_ed25519_signature_malleability_should_fail.bin` and `test_ed25519_signature_malleability_should_pass.bin`, which contain test cases for signature verification. The program defines a structure `verification_test_t` to hold a signature and a public key. It then uses this structure to iterate over the test cases, verifying each signature against a predefined message "Zcash" using the `fd_ed25519_verify` function.

The program initializes a SHA-512 context for hashing operations and processes two sets of test cases: those expected to fail and those expected to pass. For each test case, it checks if the signature verification result matches the expected outcome. If a test case does not behave as expected, the program logs an error with details about the failure. The program uses logging functions to report errors and a notice when all tests pass. The execution concludes with a call to `fd_halt` to clean up resources before exiting.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `../fd_ballet.h`


# Global Variables

---
### should\_fail
- **Type**: ``verification_test_t * const``
- **Description**: Points to a binary data structure that contains test cases for signature verification that are expected to fail. The data is imported from a binary file and cast to a pointer of type `verification_test_t`. Each element in the data structure contains a signature and a public key.
- **Use**: Used in the main function to iterate over test cases and verify that each signature fails the verification process.


---
### should\_pass
- **Type**: ``verification_test_t * const``
- **Description**: A constant pointer to a `verification_test_t` structure, initialized with the binary data from `should_pass_bin`. The `verification_test_t` structure contains a 64-byte signature and a 32-byte public key.
- **Use**: Used to store and access test data for signature verification that is expected to pass.


# Data Structures

---
### verification\_test
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `sig`: An array of 64 unsigned characters representing the signature.
    - `pub`: An array of 32 unsigned characters representing the public key.
- **Description**: Stores a digital signature and its corresponding public key, used for verifying the authenticity of a message in cryptographic operations.


---
### verification\_test\_t
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - ``sig``: An array of 64 unsigned characters that stores the signature.
    - ``pub``: An array of 32 unsigned characters that stores the public key.
- **Description**: Stores a digital signature and its corresponding public key for verification purposes.


# Functions

### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/ballet/ed25519/test_ed25519_signature_malleability.c#L14>)

Executes a series of Ed25519 signature verification tests and logs the results.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments.
    - `argv`: An array of command-line arguments.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Calls `fd_boot` to initialize the environment with command-line arguments.
    - Initializes a SHA-512 context using `fd_sha512_new` and `fd_sha512_join`.
    - Defines a message `msg` with the content "Zcash".
    - Calculates the number of tests in `should_fail` by dividing `should_fail_bin_sz` by the size of `verification_test_t`.
    - Iterates over each test in `should_fail` and verifies the signature using `fd_ed25519_verify`. If verification succeeds, logs an error message indicating failure was expected.
    - Calculates the number of tests in `should_pass` by dividing `should_pass_bin_sz` by the size of `verification_test_t`.
    - Iterates over each test in `should_pass` and verifies the signature using `fd_ed25519_verify`. If verification fails, logs an error message indicating success was expected.
    - Logs a notice message "pass" if all tests pass as expected.
    - Calls `fd_halt` to terminate the program.
- **Output**: Returns 0 to indicate successful execution.
