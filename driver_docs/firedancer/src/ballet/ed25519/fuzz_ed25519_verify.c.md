Fuzz testing for ED25519 signature verification using random data inputs.

# Purpose
The code is a fuzzer designed to test the verification functionality of the Ed25519 digital signature algorithm. It is intended to run in a hosted environment, as indicated by the preprocessor directive checking for `FD_HAS_HOSTED`. The fuzzer initializes with [`LLVMFuzzerInitialize`](<#llvmfuzzerinitialize>), which sets up the environment by disabling signal handlers, configuring logging, and registering a cleanup function with `atexit`. The main function, [`LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`](<#llvmfuzzertestoneinput>), takes random input data and attempts to verify it as an Ed25519 signature. The function checks if the input size is sufficient and then uses the `fd_ed25519_verify` function to perform the verification. The result is asserted to ensure it does not succeed, as the input is random and not expected to be a valid signature.

The code includes several components from external libraries, such as `fd_util.h`, `fd_fuzz.h`, and `fd_ed25519.h`, which provide utility functions, fuzzing support, and Ed25519 verification capabilities, respectively. The `verification_test_t` structure is used to interpret the input data, containing fields for the signature, public key, and message. The code also uses SHA-512 hashing, as indicated by the `fd_sha512_t` type and related functions, to support the signature verification process. The fuzzer is part of a broader testing framework, as suggested by the use of `FD_FUZZ_MUST_BE_COVERED`, which likely ensures that all code paths are exercised during fuzzing.

# Functions

---
### LLVMFuzzerInitialize<!-- {{#callable:LLVMFuzzerInitialize}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/ballet/ed25519/fuzz_ed25519_verify.c#L13>)

Initializes the fuzzer environment by setting environment variables, booting the framework, and configuring logging behavior.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: A pointer to the argument count, typically from the command line.
    - `argv`: A pointer to the argument vector, typically from the command line.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Set the environment variable `FD_LOG_BACKTRACE` to `0` to disable backtrace logging.
    - Call `fd_boot` with `argc` and `argv` to initialize the framework.
    - Register `fd_halt` to be called at program exit using `atexit`.
    - Set the core log level to `3` using `fd_log_level_core_set`, which will cause the program to crash on warning logs.
    - Return `0` to indicate successful initialization.
- **Output**: Returns `0` to indicate successful initialization.

### LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput<!-- {{#callable:LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/ballet/ed25519/fuzz_ed25519_verify.c#L33>)

Attempts to verify a message using the Ed25519 signature scheme with provided data.
- **Inputs**:
    - `data`: A pointer to an array of unsigned characters representing the input data.
    - `size`: The size of the input data in bytes.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Check if the size of the input data is less than 96 bytes; if true, return -1.
    - Cast the input data to a `verification_test_t` structure pointer.
    - Calculate the size of the message by subtracting 96 from the total size.
    - Initialize a SHA-512 context using `fd_sha512_new` and `fd_sha512_join`.
    - Call [`fd_ed25519_verify`](<fd_ed25519_user.c.md#fd_ed25519_verify>) to verify the message using the signature, public key, and SHA-512 context.
    - Assert that the result of the verification is not `FD_ED25519_SUCCESS`.
    - Execute `FD_FUZZ_MUST_BE_COVERED` macro to ensure code coverage.
    - Return 0 to indicate the function completed.
- **Output**: Returns 0 if the function completes, or -1 if the input size is less than 96 bytes.
- **Functions Called**:
    - [`fd_ed25519_verify`](<fd_ed25519_user.c.md#fd_ed25519_verify>)
