Secure implementations of Ed25519 point addition, doubling, conditional selection, and negation.

# Purpose
The code provides secure arithmetic operations on points in the Ed25519 elliptic curve, specifically designed to maintain constant-time execution to prevent side-channel attacks. It includes functions for point addition (`fd_ed25519_point_add_secure`), point doubling (`fd_ed25519_point_dbln_secure`), conditional point selection ([`fd_ed25519_point_if`](<#fd_ed25519_point_if>)), and conditional point negation (`fd_ed25519_point_neg_if`). These functions are implemented to ensure that sensitive data, such as secret keys, are not leaked through timing attacks. The operations use precomputed tables and temporary variables that are cleared by the caller to maintain security.

The code defines macros like `FD_R43X6_GE_ADD_TABLE_ALT` and `FD_R43X6_GE_DBL_ALT` to perform specific arithmetic operations on points using extended Edwards coordinates. These macros are optimized for security by reordering instructions and using temporary variables that can be safely cleared. The functions and macros are part of a broader cryptographic library, as indicated by the inclusion of headers like `fd_curve25519.h` and `fd_r43x6_ge.h`. The code is intended to be part of a secure cryptographic module, providing essential operations for cryptographic protocols that use the Ed25519 curve.

[View Source →](<../../../../../../src/ballet/ed25519/avx512/fd_curve25519_secure.c#L99>)

Selects between two `fd_ed25519_point_t` points based on a secret condition in constant time.
- **Inputs**:
    - `r`: A pointer to an `fd_ed25519_point_t` structure where the result will be stored.
    - `secret_cond`: An unsigned char (0 or 1) that determines which point to select.
    - `a0`: A pointer to the first `fd_ed25519_point_t` structure to select if `secret_cond` is true.
    - `a1`: A pointer to the second `fd_ed25519_point_t` structure to select if `secret_cond` is false.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Use the `wwl_if` function to select between `a0->P03` and `a1->P03` based on `-secret_cond` and assign the result to `r->P03`.
    - Use the `wwl_if` function to select between `a0->P14` and `a1->P14` based on `-secret_cond` and assign the result to `r->P14`.
    - Use the `wwl_if` function to select between `a0->P25` and `a1->P25` based on `-secret_cond` and assign the result to `r->P25`.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it modifies the `fd_ed25519_point_t` structure pointed to by `r`.
