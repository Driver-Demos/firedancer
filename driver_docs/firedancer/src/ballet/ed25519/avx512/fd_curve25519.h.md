Public API for Curve25519 operations, including point manipulation in Extended Twisted Edwards Coordinates.

# Purpose
The code defines a public API for operations on the Curve25519 elliptic curve, specifically focusing on the Edwards form of the curve, which is used in cryptographic applications. The file includes several header files that provide foundational mathematical operations and data structures necessary for elliptic curve computations. The primary data structure defined is `fd_curve25519_edwards`, which represents a point on the curve using Extended Twisted Edwards Coordinates. This structure is used to perform various operations such as setting a point to zero, copying points, converting between different coordinate representations, and performing arithmetic operations like doubling and negation.

The code provides a set of inline functions that implement these operations, ensuring efficient execution. Functions like [`fd_ed25519_point_set_zero`](<#fd_ed25519_point_set_zero>), [`fd_ed25519_point_set`](<#fd_ed25519_point_set>), and [`fd_ed25519_point_dbln`](<#fd_ed25519_point_dbln>) are used to manipulate points on the curve. The file also includes functions to check for equality between points and to determine if a point is the identity element (point at infinity). The API is designed to be used in cryptographic applications where operations on elliptic curve points are required, and it explicitly notes that most operations are not constant time, which is important for security considerations.
