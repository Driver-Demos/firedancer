APIs for manipulating ED25519 curve points using extended homogeneous coordinates with AVX-512 optimizations.

# Purpose
The code is a C header file that provides APIs for manipulating group elements or curve points in the ED25519 elliptic curve using AVX-512 instructions. It defines several macros and functions for operations on curve points represented in extended homogeneous coordinates `(X, Y, Z, T)`. These operations include setting a point to the neutral or base point, checking equality of points, adding and doubling points, encoding and decoding points, and performing scalar multiplications. The header also includes functions for computing fixed and variable-time scalar multiplications, which are critical for cryptographic operations like digital signatures.

The header file defines public APIs and external interfaces for working with ED25519 curve points, making it suitable for inclusion in other C programs that require elliptic curve cryptography. It uses macros to define operations that manipulate curve points efficiently, leveraging AVX-512 for performance optimization. The file also includes functions to mitigate timing attacks, ensuring secure cryptographic operations. The use of `FD_R43X6_QUAD` and related macros indicates a focus on high-performance arithmetic operations on the curve points, which are essential for cryptographic applications.

[View Source →](<../../../../../../src/ballet/ed25519/avx512/fd_r43x6_ge.h#L303>)

Decodes two encoded curve points into extended homogeneous coordinates.
- **Description**: Use this function to decode two encoded curve points from their compressed representations into extended homogeneous coordinates. This function attempts to decode the first point from the memory region pointed to by `_vsa` into the coordinates `_Pa03`, `_Pa14`, and `_Pa25`. If successful, it then attempts to decode the second point from the memory region pointed to by `_vsb` into the coordinates `_Pb03`, `_Pb14`, and `_Pb25`. If the first decoding fails, the second point is set to zero and the function returns -1. If the second decoding fails, the first point is set to zero and the function returns -2. On success, both points are decoded and the function returns 0. Ensure that the memory regions pointed to by `_vsa` and `_vsb` are valid and contain the encoded curve points.
- **Inputs**:
    - `_Pa03`: Pointer to a `wwl_t` where the first part of the decoded coordinates of the first point will be stored. Must not be null.
    - `_Pa14`: Pointer to a `wwl_t` where the second part of the decoded coordinates of the first point will be stored. Must not be null.
    - `_Pa25`: Pointer to a `wwl_t` where the third part of the decoded coordinates of the first point will be stored. Must not be null.
    - `_vsa`: Pointer to a constant memory region containing the encoded representation of the first curve point. Must not be null and must point to a valid 32-byte region.
    - `_Pb03`: Pointer to a `wwl_t` where the first part of the decoded coordinates of the second point will be stored. Must not be null.
    - `_Pb14`: Pointer to a `wwl_t` where the second part of the decoded coordinates of the second point will be stored. Must not be null.
