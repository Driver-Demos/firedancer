Functions for point addition, subtraction, doubling, and affine conversion on the Ed25519 curve.

# Purpose
The code provides functionality for operations on elliptic curve points, specifically for the Ed25519 curve, which is a variant of the Curve25519. It includes functions for point addition, subtraction, doubling, and conversion between different representations of points. The code is structured to allow optimizations during scalar multiplication, such as skipping certain multiplications when conditions are met (e.g., when a point is precomputed or in affine form). The functions `fd_ed25519_point_add_with_opts` and `fd_ed25519_point_sub_with_opts` are central to this, offering optional parameters to optimize these operations.

The code also includes functions for serialization and deserialization of points, as well as conversion between affine and projective coordinates. The use of inline functions and macros like `FD_R43X6_GE_ADD` and `FD_R43X6_GE_DBL` suggests that the code is designed for performance, likely intended for cryptographic applications where efficiency is critical. The file appears to be part of a larger library, as it includes headers from other files and defines functions that operate on a custom data type `fd_ed25519_point_t`. This indicates that the code is intended to be used as part of a broader cryptographic system, providing essential operations for elliptic curve cryptography.
