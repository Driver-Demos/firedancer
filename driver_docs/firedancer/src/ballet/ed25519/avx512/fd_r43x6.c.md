Functions for repeated squaring and multiplication operations on fd_r43x6_t data type in AVX-512.

# Purpose
The code provides mathematical operations on a custom data type `fd_r43x6_t`, which is likely a representation of a number in a specific finite field. The primary operations implemented are repeated squaring and multiplication, which are used to compute powers and inverses of elements in this field. The function [`fd_r43x6_repsqr_mul`](<#fd_r43x6_repsqr_mul>) performs repeated squaring followed by a multiplication, which is a common operation in modular arithmetic and cryptographic algorithms. The function [`fd_r43x6_repsqr_mul2`](<#fd_r43x6_repsqr_mul2>) extends this functionality to operate on two sets of inputs simultaneously, optimizing for instruction-level parallelism.

The code also includes functions [`fd_r43x6_invert`](<#fd_r43x6_invert>) and [`fd_r43x6_pow22523`](<#fd_r43x6_pow22523>), which compute the multiplicative inverse and a specific power of an element, respectively. These functions use a combination of repeated squaring and multiplication to achieve their results, following mathematical identities and factorizations to optimize the computation. The function [`fd_r43x6_pow22523_2`](<#fd_r43x6_pow22523_2>) is a parallel version of [`fd_r43x6_pow22523`](<#fd_r43x6_pow22523>), allowing two calculations to be performed concurrently. The code is structured to encourage inlining and efficient computation, which is important for performance in applications such as cryptography.
