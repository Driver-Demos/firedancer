Contains test vectors for Ed25519 signature verification using a static array of structured test cases.

# Purpose
The code is a collection of test vectors for the Ed25519 digital signature algorithm, organized as a static array of structures named `fd_ed25519_verify_cctvs`. Each structure represents a test case with fields such as `tc_id`, `comment`, `msg`, `msg_sz`, `sig`, `pub`, and `ok`. These fields store the test case identifier, a description, the message to be signed, the size of the message, the expected signature, the public key, and a flag indicating the expected result of the signature verification, respectively. The primary purpose of this code is to provide a set of predefined test cases to verify the correctness of an Ed25519 implementation by comparing the output of the implementation against the expected results. This code is not an executable or a library but serves as a dataset for testing environments, without defining public APIs or external interfaces.
# Imports and Dependencies

- `../fd_ballet_base.h`


# Global Variables

### ed25519\_verify\_cctvs
- **Type**: ``fd_ed25519_verify_cctv_t[]``
- **Description**: The `ed25519_verify_cctvs` is a static constant array of type `fd_ed25519_verify_cctv_t`. Each element in the array represents a test case for verifying Ed25519 signatures. The structure `fd_ed25519_verify_cctv_t` includes fields such as `tc_id` for test case identification, `comment` for descriptive text, `msg` for the message to verify, `msg_sz` for the size of the message, `sig` for the signature, `pub` for the public key, and `ok` for the expected verification result.
- **Use**: Used to store test cases for Ed25519 signature verification.


# Data Structures

---
### fd\_ed25519\_verify\_cctv
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `comment`: A pointer to a constant character string for comments.
    - `msg`: A pointer to a constant unsigned character array representing the message.
    - `msg_sz`: An unsigned long integer indicating the size of the message.
    - `pub`: An array of 32 unsigned characters representing the public key.
    - `sig`: An array of 64 unsigned characters representing the signature.
    - `tc_id`: An unsigned integer representing the test case identifier.
    - `ok`: An integer indicating the verification result.
- **Description**: Represents the data structure used for verifying an Ed25519 signature, containing fields for a comment, message, message size, public key, signature, test case identifier, and verification result.


---
### fd\_ed25519\_verify\_cctv\_t
- **Type**: `typedef`
- **Description**: Defines a type alias `fd_ed25519_verify_cctv_t` for the structure `fd_ed25519_verify_cctv`, but does not provide any details about the structure's members or purpose.
