Makefile for adding headers, objects, and unit tests for cryptographic operations in the fd_ballet module.

# Purpose
The Makefile content defines build and test instructions for cryptographic components related to the Curve25519 and Ed25519 algorithms. It uses macros to add header files and object files to the build process, specifically for files like `fd_ed25519.h` and `fd_curve25519_scalar`. The file also specifies unit tests for various components, such as `test_ed25519` and `test_x25519`, and includes instructions to run these tests. Additionally, if the `FD_HAS_HOSTED` condition is met, the file includes fuzz testing for Ed25519 verification functions, enhancing the robustness of the cryptographic verification process. The use of `$(call ...)` indicates a modular approach to managing build and test tasks within the Makefile.
