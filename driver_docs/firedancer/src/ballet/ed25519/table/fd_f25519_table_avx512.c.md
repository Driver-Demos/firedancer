Auto-generated constants for finite field arithmetic in the Ed25519 curve using AVX-512.

# Purpose
The code defines a set of constant values used in cryptographic computations involving the finite field `fd_f25519_t`, which is based on the prime number 2^255 - 19. These constants are used in elliptic curve cryptography, specifically for operations on the Curve25519 curve. The constants include `fd_f25519_zero`, `fd_f25519_one`, `fd_f25519_minus_one`, `fd_f25519_two`, and several others that represent specific mathematical values or results of operations within the field, such as `fd_f25519_k`, `fd_f25519_d`, and `fd_f25519_sqrtm1`.

The file is auto-generated and should not be modified manually. It is intended to be included indirectly through another header file, as indicated by the preprocessor directive that checks for the inclusion of `fd_f25519.h`. The constants are defined as static, meaning they are limited to the file scope and are not intended to be accessed directly from other files. This file is part of a larger cryptographic library and provides essential constants for performing secure mathematical operations on the Curve25519 elliptic curve.
