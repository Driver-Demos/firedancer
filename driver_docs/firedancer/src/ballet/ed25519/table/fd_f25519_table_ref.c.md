Auto-generated constants for finite field arithmetic in the Ed25519 elliptic curve.

# Purpose
This code defines a set of constant values used in cryptographic operations related to the Curve25519 elliptic curve. The constants are represented as arrays of type `fd_f25519_t`, which is likely a custom data type designed to handle 255-bit numbers, commonly used in cryptographic algorithms. Each constant is initialized with a specific hexadecimal value, which corresponds to important mathematical constants used in elliptic curve computations, such as zero, one, minus one, and other specific values like `fd_f25519_k` and `fd_f25519_d`.

The file is auto-generated and should not be modified manually. It is intended to be included indirectly through another header file, as indicated by the preprocessor directive that checks for the inclusion of `fd_f25519.h`. This suggests that the file is part of a larger library or framework that deals with elliptic curve cryptography, specifically using the Curve25519 curve. The constants defined here are likely used in various cryptographic functions to perform operations such as point addition, scalar multiplication, and other elliptic curve-related calculations.
