Defines constants and precomputed tables for efficient and secure Ed25519 elliptic curve operations.

# Purpose
The code is a header file that defines constants and tables for cryptographic operations related to the Ed25519 elliptic curve, forming part of a larger cryptographic library. It includes constants such as `fd_ed25519_base_point`, which represents the base point of the Ed25519 curve, and `fd_ed25519_order8_point_y0` and `fd_ed25519_order8_point_y1`, which are specific low-order points used in cryptographic checks. The file also contains precomputed tables like `fd_ed25519_base_point_wnaf_table` for fast scalar multiplication using the windowed Non-Adjacent Form (w-NAF) method, and `fd_ed25519_base_point_const_time_table` for constant-time scalar multiplication to prevent timing attacks. The code is auto-generated and intended to be included indirectly through another header file, as indicated by the `#error` directive. It does not define public APIs or external interfaces but provides internal data structures and constants for efficient and secure elliptic curve operations. The data is organized into nested arrays of hexadecimal values, suggesting its use for storing precomputed data or constants in cryptographic operations.
