Contains precomputed tables and constants for efficient Ed25519 elliptic curve cryptographic operations.

# Purpose
The code is a collection of precomputed tables and constants used for cryptographic operations involving the Ed25519 elliptic curve, forming part of a larger cryptographic library. It is intended to be included indirectly through a header file, as indicated by the `#error` directive at the beginning. The code provides internal data structures, such as static constant arrays like `fd_ed25519_base_point` and `fd_ed25519_base_point_wnaf_table`, which contain precomputed points on the Ed25519 curve to optimize operations like scalar multiplication and signature verification. The data is organized in a structured format with hexadecimal values, likely auto-generated to ensure consistency and correctness, and is used internally by other parts of the library to perform efficient cryptographic computations. The code does not define public APIs or external interfaces, and its purpose and usage are determined by the context in which it is used within the software system.
