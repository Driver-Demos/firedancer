Public API and data structures for Curve25519 operations, including point manipulation and precomputation.

# Purpose
The code defines a public API for operations on the Curve25519 elliptic curve, specifically focusing on the Edwards form of the curve, which is used in cryptographic applications. The file includes several header files that provide foundational types and operations, such as `fd_f25519_t` for field elements and functions for arithmetic operations on these elements. The primary data structure defined is `fd_curve25519_edwards`, which represents a point on the curve using Extended Twisted Edwards Coordinates. This structure is used to perform various operations on points, such as setting a point to zero, copying points, and performing arithmetic operations like negation and addition.

The code provides a collection of functions that manipulate points on the Curve25519 elliptic curve. These functions include setting a point to the point at infinity, copying points, converting between different representations, and performing arithmetic operations such as negation and addition. The code also includes optimizations for precomputed tables, which can improve the efficiency of certain operations. The file is intended to be included as part of a larger library, as indicated by the inclusion guards and the use of external header files. The functions are designed to be used in cryptographic applications where operations on elliptic curve points are required.
