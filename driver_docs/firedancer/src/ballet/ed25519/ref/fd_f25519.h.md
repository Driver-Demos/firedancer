Implements operations for Curve25519 field elements, including addition, multiplication, and serialization.

# Purpose
The code defines a set of operations for handling field elements in the Curve25519 elliptic curve, which is commonly used in cryptographic applications. The file provides a structure `fd_f25519_t` to represent a field element, which can be stored in either 10 `uint` (32-bit) or 5 `ulong` (64-bit) integers, depending on the configuration. The code includes functions for basic arithmetic operations such as multiplication, squaring, addition, subtraction, and negation of these field elements. It also includes functions for serialization and deserialization of field elements to and from byte arrays, as well as conditional operations like selecting between two elements or swapping them based on a condition.

The file is intended to be included indirectly through `fd_f25519.h`, as indicated by the preprocessor directive at the beginning. It uses the Fiat-Crypto library for efficient arithmetic operations on the Curve25519 field elements. The code provides both scalar and vectorized operations, allowing for multiple field element operations to be performed in parallel. The functions are defined as inline, suggesting that they are intended for performance-critical applications where minimizing function call overhead is important. The file does not define a public API but rather provides internal implementations for use within a larger cryptographic library or application.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `../../fd_ballet_base.h`

- `../table/fd_f25519_table_ref.c`


# Data Structures

---
### fd\_f25519
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - ``el``: Stores the field element as an array of either 10 `uint` (32-bit) or 5 `ulong` (64-bit) depending on the `USE_FIAT_32` flag.
- **Description**: Stores a Curve25519 field element, which is a key component in elliptic curve cryptography. The structure uses conditional compilation to define the element storage format, allowing for either a 32-bit or 64-bit representation. This flexibility supports different performance and compatibility requirements in cryptographic computations.


---
### fd\_f25519\_t
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - ``el``: Stores the field element as an array of either 10 `uint` (32-bit) or 5 `ulong` (64-bit) integers, depending on the compilation configuration.
- **Description**: Represents a field element in the Curve25519 elliptic curve, used for cryptographic operations. The structure can store the element in two different formats, either as an array of 10 32-bit unsigned integers or as an array of 5 64-bit unsigned integers, based on the `USE_FIAT_32` preprocessor directive. This flexibility allows for optimized performance on different hardware architectures. The structure is used in various arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and serialization/deserialization of field elements.
