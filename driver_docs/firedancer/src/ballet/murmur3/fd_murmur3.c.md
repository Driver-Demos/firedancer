Implements the Murmur3 hash function for 32-bit unsigned integers.

# Purpose
The code implements the MurmurHash3 algorithm, specifically a 32-bit variant, which is a non-cryptographic hash function suitable for general hash-based lookup. The primary function, [`fd_murmur3_32`](<#fd_murmur3_32>), serves as a public interface that calls the static helper function [`fd_murmur3_32_`](<#fd_murmur3_32_>). The helper function performs the actual computation of the hash value. It processes the input data in 4-byte chunks, applying a series of bitwise operations and multiplications to mix the input data into a hash value. The function also handles any remaining bytes that do not fit into a 4-byte chunk, ensuring that all input data contributes to the final hash value.

The code includes constants and operations that are specific to the MurmurHash3 algorithm, such as the constants `c1`, `c2`, `m`, and `n`, and the rotation operations `fd_uint_rotate_left`. The use of `FD_LOAD` and `fd_uint_rotate_left` suggests that these are likely macros or functions defined elsewhere, possibly in the included header file `fd_murmur3.h`. The function is designed to be efficient and is suitable for use in applications where a fast, non-cryptographic hash function is required. The static nature of [`fd_murmur3_32_`](<#fd_murmur3_32_>) indicates that it is intended for use only within this source file, while [`fd_murmur3_32`](<#fd_murmur3_32>) is the function intended for external use.

[View Source →](<../../../../../src/ballet/murmur3/fd_murmur3.c#L3>)

Computes a 32-bit hash value using the Murmur3 algorithm for a given data input and seed.
- **Inputs**:
    - `_data`: A pointer to the input data to hash.
    - `sz`: The size of the input data in bytes.
    - `seed`: An initial seed value for the hash computation.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Initialize constants `c1`, `c2`, `r1`, `r2`, `m`, and `n` for the Murmur3 algorithm.
    - Set `hash` to the initial `seed` value.
    - Iterate over the input data in 4-byte chunks while `sz` is greater than or equal to 4.
    - For each 4-byte chunk, load it into `k`, multiply by `c1`, rotate left by `r1`, multiply by `c2`, and update `hash` with XOR and rotation operations.
    - Adjust `data` pointer and decrement `sz` by 4 for each iteration.
    - Handle remaining bytes (less than 4) using a switch statement to update `rem` and `hash` accordingly.
    - Finalize the hash by XORing with `sz_tag`, applying bit shifts, multiplications, and XOR operations to mix the hash thoroughly.
    - Return the final hash value.
- **Output**: A 32-bit unsigned integer representing the hash of the input data.

Computes a 32-bit hash value using the Murmur3 algorithm for a given data input and seed.
- **Inputs**:
    - `_data`: A pointer to the input data to hash.
    - `sz`: The size of the input data in bytes.
    - `seed`: An initial seed value for the hash computation.
