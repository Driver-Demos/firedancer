APIs for Murmur3 hashing, including functions for computing and inverting program counter hashes.

# Purpose
The code is a C header file that provides APIs for Murmur3 hashing functions. It includes the function [`fd_murmur3_32`](<#fd_murmur3_32>), which computes a 32-bit Murmur3 hash for a given input data and seed, ensuring idempotency. Additionally, it defines [`fd_pchash`](<#fd_pchash>), a static inline function that computes a hash of a program counter, and [`fd_pchash_inverse`](<#fd_pchash_inverse>), which is the inverse function of [`fd_pchash`](<#fd_pchash>). These functions are useful for generating and reversing hashes, particularly in contexts where program counter values need to be hashed and later retrieved. The file includes necessary headers and uses macros to manage function prototypes.

### fd\_pchash<!-- {{#callable:fd_pchash}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/ballet/murmur3/fd_murmur3.h#L25>)

Computes a hash of a program counter using a series of bitwise operations and multiplications.
- **Inputs**:
    - `pc`: An unsigned integer representing the program counter to hash.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Initialize `x` with the value of `pc`.
    - Multiply `x` by the constant `0xcc9e2d51U`.
    - Rotate `x` left by 15 bits using `fd_uint_rotate_left`.
    - Multiply `x` by the constant `0x1b873593U`.
    - Rotate `x` left by 13 bits using `fd_uint_rotate_left`.
    - Multiply `x` by 5 and add the constant `0xe6546b64U`.
    - Rotate `x` left by 13 bits using `fd_uint_rotate_left`.
    - Multiply `x` by 5 and add the constant `0xe6546b64U`.
    - XOR `x` with 8.
    - XOR `x` with `x` right-shifted by 16 bits.
    - Multiply `x` by the constant `0x85ebca6bU`.
    - XOR `x` with `x` right-shifted by 13 bits.
    - Multiply `x` by the constant `0xc2b2ae35U`.
    - XOR `x` with `x` right-shifted by 16 bits.
    - Return the final value of `x`.
- **Output**: Returns an unsigned integer representing the computed hash of the program counter.

### fd\_pchash\_inverse<!-- {{#callable:fd_pchash_inverse}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/ballet/murmur3/fd_murmur3.h#L51>)

Reverses the hash transformation applied by `fd_pchash` to retrieve the original value.
- **Inputs**:
    - `hash`: The 32-bit unsigned integer hash value to invert.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Initialize `x` with the input `hash`.
    - Apply a series of bitwise XOR operations and multiplications with specific constants to `x`.
    - Use the `fd_uint_rotate_right` function to rotate `x` right by 13 and 15 bits at different stages.
    - Subtract and multiply `x` with specific constants to reverse the transformations applied by `fd_pchash`.
    - Return the final value of `x` as the result.
- **Output**: Returns the original 32-bit unsigned integer value that was transformed into the given `hash` by `fd_pchash`.


# Function Declarations (Public API)

### fd\_murmur3\_32<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_murmur3_32}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/ballet/murmur3/fd_murmur3.h#L8>)

Computes the Murmur3-32 hash of a given data block.
- **Description**: Use this function to compute a 32-bit Murmur3 hash of a specified block of data. It requires a pointer to the data, the size of the data in bytes, and a seed value for the hash computation. The function is idempotent, meaning it will consistently return the same hash value for the same input data and seed. This function is useful for generating hash values for data integrity checks or hash-based data structures.
- **Inputs**:
    - `data`: A pointer to the first byte of the input data block. The data must be contiguous in memory and can be freed after the function returns. Must not be null.
    - `sz`: The size of the data block in bytes. Must be a non-negative value.
    - `seed`: A 32-bit unsigned integer used as the seed for the hash computation. Any 32-bit unsigned integer is valid.
- **Output**: Returns a 32-bit unsigned integer representing the hash digest of the input data.
- **See Also**: [`fd_murmur3_32`](<fd_murmur3.c.md#fd_murmur3_32>)  (Implementation)
