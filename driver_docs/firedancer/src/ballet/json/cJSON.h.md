Header file for the cJSON library, defining structures, macros, and functions for JSON parsing and manipulation.

# Purpose
The code is a C header file for the `cJSON` library, which provides functionality for parsing, creating, and manipulating JSON data in C. It defines the `cJSON` structure, which represents JSON data types such as objects, arrays, strings, numbers, booleans, and null values. The file includes macros and function declarations for handling JSON data, such as parsing JSON strings into `cJSON` objects, printing `cJSON` objects as JSON strings, and managing memory allocation for JSON data structures.

The header file also includes platform-specific configurations for symbol visibility and calling conventions, particularly for Windows and Unix-like systems. It defines several macros to control the export and import of symbols, ensuring compatibility across different compilers and platforms. Additionally, the file provides utility functions for creating and modifying JSON objects and arrays, as well as functions for comparing and duplicating `cJSON` items. The file is intended to be included in C projects that require JSON parsing and manipulation capabilities, and it defines a public API for interacting with JSON data through the `cJSON` library.
# Imports and Dependencies

# Data Structures

---
### cJSON
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - ``next``: Points to the next item in an array or object chain.
    - ``prev``: Points to the previous item in an array or object chain.
    - ``child``: Points to the first child in an array or object.
    - ``type``: Stores the type of the JSON item.
    - ``valuestring``: Holds the string value if the item is a string or raw JSON.
    - ``valueint``: Deprecated integer value of the item.
    - ``valuedouble``: Stores the numeric value if the item is a number.
    - ``valueulong``: Stores an unsigned long value.
    - ``string``: Holds the name of the item if it is a child or subitem of an object.
- **Description**: Represents a JSON item in a tree structure, allowing navigation through JSON arrays and objects with pointers to next, previous, and child items, and storing data types and values for JSON elements.


---
### cJSON\_Hooks
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - ``malloc_fn``: A function pointer for memory allocation, using the `CJSON_CDECL` calling convention.
    - ``free_fn``: A function pointer for memory deallocation, using the `CJSON_CDECL` calling convention.
- **Description**: Defines custom memory allocation and deallocation functions for use with the cJSON library, allowing users to specify their own `malloc` and `free` functions, which is particularly useful for integrating with different memory management systems or environments.
