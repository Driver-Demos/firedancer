Header file for cryptographic functions and data structures including Ed25519, Shred, Bmtree, and Blake3.

# Purpose
This code is a C header file that serves as an inclusion guard and organizes the inclusion of several other header files related to cryptographic operations. The file uses preprocessor directives to prevent multiple inclusions, which can cause compilation errors. It includes headers for cryptographic algorithms and data structures, such as `fd_ed25519.h` for Ed25519 digital signatures, `fd_shred.h` for data shredding, `fd_bmtree.h` for binary Merkle trees, and `fd_blake3.h` for the BLAKE3 hash function. The commented-out includes suggest dependencies on utility functions and other cryptographic components like SHA-256 and SHA-512, which are indirectly included through other headers.
