Makefile for adding headers, objects, and unit tests for `fd_wsample` in the `firedancer` codebase.

# Purpose
The Makefile content defines build and test instructions for a software project. It adds the header file `fd_wsample.h` and object files `fd_wsample` and `fd_ballet` to the build process. It also specifies a unit test named `test_wsample`, which depends on `fd_ballet` and `fd_util`, and includes a command to execute this unit test.
