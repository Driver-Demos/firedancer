Weighted sampling algorithm and tests, ChaCha20 methods, and Makefile for `fd_wsample`.


## Files
- **[fd_wsample.c](fd_wsample.c.md)**: Implements a weighted sampling algorithm using a radix-9 tree structure for efficient sampling and removal operations.
- **[fd_wsample.h](fd_wsample.h.md)**: Defines methods for computing weighted random samples using ChaCha20, as used by Solana for leader scheduling and Turbine trees.
- **[Local.mk](Local.mk.md)**: Makefile for adding headers, objects, and unit tests for `fd_wsample` in the `firedancer` codebase.
- **[test_wsample.c](test_wsample.c.md)**: Tests for weighted sampling functions, including chi-squared tests and various sampling scenarios.
