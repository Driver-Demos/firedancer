Makefile for building and testing SHA-256 components with optional AVX and AVX512 optimizations.

# Purpose
This Makefile script configures the build process for a software project involving SHA-256 functionality. It adds header files and object files for `fd_sha256` and `fd_ballet`, and conditionally includes additional object files for AVX and AVX512 optimizations if the corresponding flags `FD_HAS_AVX` and `FD_HAS_AVX512` are set. The script also defines and runs a unit test named `test_sha256`, and conditionally creates a fuzz test named `fuzz_sha256` if the `FD_HAS_HOSTED` flag is set.
