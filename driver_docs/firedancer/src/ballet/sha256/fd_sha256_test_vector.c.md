Test vectors for SHA-256 computed using OpenSSL on randomly generated text strings.

# Purpose
The code defines a set of test vectors for the SHA-256 hashing algorithm. These test vectors are used to verify the correctness of SHA-256 implementations by providing known input strings and their corresponding hash outputs. The `fd_sha256_test_vector` structure is used to store each test vector, which includes a message (`msg`), the size of the message (`sz`), and the expected SHA-256 hash (`hash`). The test vectors are stored in a constant array `fd_sha256_test_vector`, which can be used in testing environments to ensure that a SHA-256 implementation produces the correct hash for given inputs.

The code also includes a commented-out section that describes how the input test strings were generated using a random number generator and the OpenSSL SHA-256 binary. This section is not meant to be compiled directly, as indicated by the preprocessor directive `#if 0`. The test vectors cover a range of input sizes and content, providing a comprehensive set of cases for testing the SHA-256 algorithm. The array is terminated with a vector containing a `NULL` message and a hash of zeroes, indicating the end of the test vectors.
# Global Variables

---
### \_sz
- **Type**: `double`
- **Description**: A global variable that is initialized to 0.0.
- **Use**: Used in a loop to generate test strings for OpenSSL.


---
### fac
- **Type**: `double`
- **Description**: The `fac` variable is a global variable of type `double` that is initialized to the square root of the square root of 2. This value is approximately 1.189207115.
- **Use**: The `fac` variable is used in a loop to increment the `_sz` variable by multiplying it with `fac` until `_sz` reaches 4096.


---
### fd\_sha256\_test\_vector
- **Type**: ``fd_sha256_test_vector_t const[]``
- **Description**: An array of `fd_sha256_test_vector_t` structures, each containing a message string, its size, and the corresponding SHA-256 hash. The array is used to store test vectors for verifying SHA-256 hash computations.
- **Use**: Used to store and access predefined SHA-256 test vectors for validation purposes.


# Data Structures

---
### fd\_sha256\_test\_vector
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `msg`: Pointer to a constant character array representing the message.
    - `sz`: Unsigned long integer representing the size of the message.
    - `hash`: Array of 32 unsigned characters representing the SHA-256 hash of the message.
- **Description**: Defines a test vector for SHA-256 hashing, containing a message, its size, and the corresponding SHA-256 hash. This structure is used to store precomputed hash values for various messages, facilitating the testing of SHA-256 implementations.
