Test vectors for SHA-256 short message hashing with varying message lengths and their corresponding digests.

# Purpose
This file contains test vectors for the SHA-256 cryptographic hash function, specifically for short messages. Each test vector consists of a message of varying length, represented in hexadecimal format, and its corresponding SHA-256 hash digest, also in hexadecimal format. The `Len` field specifies the length of the message in bits, the `Msg` field contains the message itself, and the `MD` field contains the resulting message digest. These test vectors are used to verify the correctness of SHA-256 implementations by comparing the computed hash of a given message against the expected hash value provided in the file. This file is relevant to the codebase as it provides a standardized set of inputs and expected outputs for testing and validating the integrity and accuracy of SHA-256 implementations.
# Content Summary
The provided content is a configuration file for testing the SHA-256 cryptographic hash function. The file contains a series of test cases, each specifying a message of varying lengths and their corresponding SHA-256 hash outputs. The key components of the file are as follows:

1. **Header Information**: 
   - The file begins with comments indicating the version of the Cryptographic Algorithm Validation System (CAVS) used, which is version 11.0.
   - It specifies that the tests are for "SHA-256 ShortMsg" and are configured for byte-oriented implementations.
   - The file was generated on March 15, 2011.

2. **Test Cases**:
   - Each test case is structured with three fields: `Len`, `Msg`, and `MD`.
   - `Len` indicates the length of the message in bits.
   - `Msg` is the hexadecimal representation of the message to be hashed.
   - `MD` is the resulting SHA-256 hash (Message Digest) of the message, also represented in hexadecimal format.

3. **Message Lengths**:
   - The message lengths (`Len`) range from 0 bits to 512 bits, increasing in increments of 8 bits.
   - This range allows for testing the SHA-256 algorithm's ability to handle messages of various sizes.

4. **Purpose**:
   - The file is used to validate the correctness of SHA-256 implementations by comparing the computed hash values against the expected `MD` values provided in the file.
   - Developers can use this file to ensure their SHA-256 implementation produces the correct hash outputs for the given input messages.

This configuration file is essential for developers who need to verify the accuracy and reliability of their SHA-256 hash function implementations.
