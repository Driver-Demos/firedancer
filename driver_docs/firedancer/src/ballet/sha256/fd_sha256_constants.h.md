SHA-256 constants for use in cryptographic computations, including initial hash values and round constants.

# Purpose
This C header file defines constants used in the SHA-256 cryptographic hash function. It includes a static array `fd_sha256_K` containing 64 constant values, which are the round constants used in the SHA-256 algorithm. The array is aligned to 64 bytes to optimize memory access. Additionally, the file defines initial hash values `FD_SHA256_INITIAL_A` through `FD_SHA256_INITIAL_H`, which are used to initialize the hash state before processing input data. The use of these constants allows the compiler to perform constant propagation, improving the efficiency of the hash computation.
