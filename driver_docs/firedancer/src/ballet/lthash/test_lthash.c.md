Tests and benchmarks for the lthash implementation using BLAKE3 hashing in the Firedancer codebase.

# Purpose
The code is a C program that tests and benchmarks a hash function implementation using the BLAKE3 cryptographic hash function. It includes two main components: a test suite and a benchmarking function. The test suite verifies the correctness of the hash function by comparing computed hash values against predefined expected values (`lthash_hello` and `lthash_world`). It performs operations such as hashing the strings "hello" and "world!", adding and subtracting hash values, and checking the results against expected outcomes. The benchmarking function, [`bench_lthash_seq`](<#bench_lthash_seq>), measures the performance of the hash function by calculating the number of hashes per second for a 128-byte input.

The program includes several static arrays and functions to facilitate these operations. The arrays `lthash_hello` and `lthash_world` store expected hash values for comparison. The function [`bench_lthash_seq`](<#bench_lthash_seq>) benchmarks the sequential API of the hash function, while the [`main`](<#main>) function orchestrates the initialization, testing, and cleanup processes. The program uses logging to report the results of tests and benchmarks, and it includes error handling to ensure the correctness of the hash operations. Additionally, the program imports functionality from other files, such as `fd_lthash.h` and `test_lthash_adder.c`, indicating that it is part of a larger codebase focused on hash function operations.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `fd_lthash.h`
- `test_lthash_adder.c`


# Global Variables

---
### lthash\_hello
- **Type**: ``ushort const[1024]``
- **Description**: Contains a static array of 1024 unsigned short integers initialized with hexadecimal values. This array is used as a reference or expected output for hash operations in the program.
- **Use**: Used in hash operations to compare against computed hash values for validation.


---
### lthash\_world
- **Type**: ``ushort` array`
- **Description**: A static constant array of 1024 unsigned short integers, each represented in hexadecimal format. This array is initialized with specific values.
- **Use**: Used as a reference hash value for the string 'world!' in hash computations.


# Functions

---
### bench\_lthash\_seq<!-- {{#callable:bench_lthash_seq}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/ballet/lthash/test_lthash.c#L138>)

Benchmarks the sequential API of the `lthash` function using a 128-byte input.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Logs the start of the benchmarking process for the `lthash` sequential API with a 128-byte input.
    - Initializes a `fd_blake3_t` structure for hashing and verifies its successful creation.
    - Performs a warmup loop where it hashes the `lthash_hello` array 16,384 times (iter_target >> 7) and measures the time taken.
    - Executes the main benchmarking loop where it hashes the `lthash_hello` array 2,097,152 times (iter_target) and measures the time taken.
    - Calculates and logs the hash rate and time per hash based on the measured time and number of iterations.
    - Cleans up by deleting the `fd_blake3_t` structure.
- **Output**: No output is returned from this function as it primarily logs benchmarking results.

### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/ballet/lthash/test_lthash.c#L167>)

Initializes and tests the BLAKE3 hash function and lthash operations, performs benchmarks, and logs results.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments.
    - `argv`: An array of command-line arguments.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Calls `fd_boot` to initialize the environment with command-line arguments.
    - Creates a random number generator `rng` using `fd_rng_new` and `fd_rng_join`.
    - Initializes BLAKE3 hasher and lthash value structures.
    - Computes the BLAKE3 hash of the string "hello" and verifies it against `lthash_hello`.
    - Initializes the hasher, appends "hello", finalizes the hash, and checks the result against `lthash_hello`.
    - Repeats the hashing process for "world!" and checks against `lthash_world`.
    - Adds the hash of "world!" to the hash of "hello" and verifies the result.
    - Removes the hash of "hello" and verifies the result matches `lthash_world`.
    - Removes the hash of "world!" and verifies the result is zero.
    - Tests [`fd_lthash_zero`](<fd_lthash.h.md#fd_lthash_zero>) to ensure it produces a zeroed hash.
    - Logs success messages for each test and benchmark.
    - Calls [`test_lthash_adder`](<test_lthash_adder.c.md#test_lthash_adder>), [`bench_lthash_seq`](<#bench_lthash_seq>), and [`bench_lthash_adder`](<test_lthash_adder.c.md#bench_lthash_adder>) for additional tests and benchmarks.
    - Deletes the random number generator and halts the program.
- **Output**: Returns 0 to indicate successful execution.
- **Functions Called**:
    - [`fd_lthash_add`](<fd_lthash.h.md#fd_lthash_add>)
    - [`fd_lthash_sub`](<fd_lthash.h.md#fd_lthash_sub>)
    - [`fd_lthash_zero`](<fd_lthash.h.md#fd_lthash_zero>)
    - [`test_lthash_adder`](<test_lthash_adder.c.md#test_lthash_adder>)
    - [`bench_lthash_seq`](<#bench_lthash_seq>)
    - [`bench_lthash_adder`](<test_lthash_adder.c.md#bench_lthash_adder>)
