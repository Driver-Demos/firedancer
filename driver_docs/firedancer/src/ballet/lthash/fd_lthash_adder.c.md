Defines and initializes a parallelized lthash adder with AVX512 and AVX support.

# Purpose
The code defines functions for managing an `fd_lthash_adder_t` structure, which is likely used for hash addition operations. The file includes conditional compilation directives to set the `FD_LTHASH_ADDER_PARA_CNT` based on the availability of AVX512 or AVX instruction sets, indicating that the code is optimized for different levels of parallel processing capabilities. The [`fd_lthash_adder_new`](<#fd_lthash_adder_new>) function initializes an `fd_lthash_adder_t` object, ensuring it is not null and is properly aligned. It also sets up batch pointers if the parallel count is greater than one, which suggests that the structure supports batch processing of data.

The [`fd_lthash_adder_delete`](<#fd_lthash_adder_delete>) function is a placeholder for deleting or cleaning up the `fd_lthash_adder_t` structure, but currently, it does not perform any operations other than returning `NULL`. This code is part of a library intended to be used elsewhere, as it defines functions for creating and deleting hash adder objects. The presence of logging for warnings indicates that the code includes basic error handling for incorrect usage or misalignment of the adder structure.

### fd\_lthash\_adder\_new<!-- {{#callable:fd_lthash_adder_new}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/ballet/lthash/fd_lthash_adder.c#L11>)

Initializes a `fd_lthash_adder_t` structure if it is non-null and properly aligned.
- **Inputs**:
    - `adder`: A pointer to a `fd_lthash_adder_t` structure that needs initialization.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Check if `adder` is NULL; if true, log a warning and return NULL.
    - Check if `adder` is not aligned to `FD_LTHASH_ADDER_ALIGN`; if true, log a warning and return NULL.
    - Set all bytes of `adder` to zero using `fd_memset`.
    - If `FD_LTHASH_ADDER_PARA_CNT` is greater than 1, initialize `adder->batch_ptrs` with pointers to `adder->batch_data` offset by multiples of `FD_BLAKE3_CHUNK_SZ`.
    - Return the initialized `adder`.
- **Output**: Returns the initialized `fd_lthash_adder_t` pointer or NULL if initialization fails.

### fd\_lthash\_adder\_delete<!-- {{#callable:fd_lthash_adder_delete}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/ballet/lthash/fd_lthash_adder.c#L30>)

Returns `NULL` after receiving an `fd_lthash_adder_t` pointer.
- **Inputs**:
    - `adder`: A pointer to an `fd_lthash_adder_t` structure, which is not used in the function.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - The function takes an `fd_lthash_adder_t` pointer as an argument.
    - The function does not perform any operations on the `adder` pointer.
    - The function returns `NULL`.
- **Output**: Always returns `NULL`.
