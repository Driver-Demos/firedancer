Methods for converting between binary and hexadecimal representations.

# Purpose
The `fd_hex.h` header file provides functions for converting data between binary and hexadecimal formats. It includes two main functions: [`fd_hex_decode`](<#fd_hex_decode>) and [`fd_hex_encode`](<#fd_hex_encode>). The [`fd_hex_decode`](<#fd_hex_decode>) function reads a specified number of characters from a hex-encoded source buffer and writes the decoded bytes to a destination buffer, returning the size of the decoded data on success or the index of failure on error. The [`fd_hex_encode`](<#fd_hex_encode>) function converts binary data from a source buffer into a hexadecimal string, storing the result in a destination buffer. The header file ensures that encoding uses lowercase hexadecimal characters and that decoding is case-insensitive.

### fd\_hex\_decode<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_hex_decode}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/ballet/hex/fd_hex.h#L17>)

Decodes a hex-encoded string into a binary buffer.
- **Description**: Use this function to convert a hex-encoded string into its binary representation. It reads up to `sz*2` characters from the source buffer and writes up to `sz` decoded bytes to the destination buffer. The function is case-insensitive and processes characters matching `[0-9a-fA-F]`. It returns the number of bytes successfully decoded or the index of the byte where decoding failed. Ensure that the destination buffer is large enough to hold `sz` bytes.
- **Inputs**:
    - `dst`: A pointer to the destination buffer where decoded bytes will be written. Must not be null and should have space for at least `sz` bytes. Caller retains ownership.
    - `src`: A pointer to the source buffer containing the hex-encoded string. Must not be null and should contain at least `sz*2` characters. Caller retains ownership.
    - `sz`: The number of bytes to decode. The function will read `sz*2` characters from `src` and write up to `sz` bytes to `dst`.
- **Output**: Returns the number of bytes successfully decoded. If decoding fails, returns the index of the byte where the failure occurred.
- **See Also**: [`fd_hex_decode`](<fd_hex.c.md#fd_hex_decode>)  (Implementation)

### fd\_hex\_encode<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_hex_encode}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/ballet/hex/fd_hex.h#L22>)

Encodes binary data into a hexadecimal string.
- **Description**: Use this function to convert binary data into a hexadecimal string representation. Each byte of the input data is encoded as two hexadecimal characters. The function writes the encoded characters to the destination buffer. Ensure that the destination buffer is large enough to hold the resulting string, which will be twice the size of the input data. This function does not append a null terminator to the output string, so the caller must handle string termination if necessary.
- **Inputs**:
    - `dst`: A pointer to the destination buffer where the encoded hexadecimal string will be written. The buffer must be large enough to hold at least `2 * sz` characters. The caller retains ownership of the buffer.
    - `_src`: A pointer to the source buffer containing the binary data to encode. The data is read-only, and the caller retains ownership of the buffer.
    - `sz`: The number of bytes to read from the source buffer and encode. Must be a non-negative value.
- **Output**: Returns a pointer to the position in the destination buffer immediately after the last written character.
- **See Also**: [`fd_hex_encode`](<fd_hex.c.md#fd_hex_encode>)  (Implementation)
