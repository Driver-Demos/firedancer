Makefile for adding headers, objects, and conditional fuzz testing in the `firedancer` codebase.

# Purpose
The `Makefile` content defines build instructions for a software project. It uses the `add-hdrs` and `add-objs` functions to include the header file `fd_hex.h` and the object files `fd_hex` and `fd_ballet` in the build process. If the `FD_HAS_HOSTED` variable is defined, it calls the `make-fuzz-test` function to create a fuzz test named `fuzz_hex`, which depends on the `fd_ballet` and `fd_util` components.
