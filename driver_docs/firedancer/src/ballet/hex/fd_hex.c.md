Functions for encoding and decoding hexadecimal strings.

# Purpose
The code provides functionality for encoding and decoding hexadecimal data. It includes two main functions: [`fd_hex_decode`](<#fd_hex_decode>) and [`fd_hex_encode`](<#fd_hex_encode>). The [`fd_hex_decode`](<#fd_hex_decode>) function converts a hexadecimal string into its binary representation. It takes a destination buffer, a source hexadecimal string, and the size of the data to decode. It uses the helper function [`fd_hex_unhex`](<#fd_hex_unhex>) to convert individual hexadecimal characters to their numeric values. If an invalid character is encountered, the function returns the number of successfully decoded bytes up to that point.

The [`fd_hex_encode`](<#fd_hex_encode>) function performs the reverse operation, converting binary data into a hexadecimal string. It takes a destination buffer, a source binary data buffer, and the size of the data to encode. The function uses a lookup table (`lut`) to map binary values to their corresponding hexadecimal characters. Both functions are designed to handle data of arbitrary size, as indicated by the `ulong` type for the size parameter. The code is intended to be part of a larger system, as indicated by the inclusion of the header file `fd_hex.h`.

### fd\_hex\_unhex<!-- {{#callable:fd_hex_unhex}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/ballet/hex/fd_hex.c#L4>)

Converts a hexadecimal character to its integer value.
- **Inputs**:
    - `c`: An integer representing a character to convert from hexadecimal to integer.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Check if `c` is a digit between '0' and '9'; if true, return the integer value by subtracting '0'.
    - Check if `c` is a lowercase letter between 'a' and 'f'; if true, return the integer value by subtracting 'a' and adding 10.
    - Check if `c` is an uppercase letter between 'A' and 'F'; if true, return the integer value by subtracting 'A' and adding 10.
    - If `c` does not match any of the above conditions, return -1.
- **Output**: Returns the integer value of the hexadecimal character, or -1 if the character is not a valid hexadecimal digit.

### fd\_hex\_decode<!-- {{#callable:fd_hex_decode}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/ballet/hex/fd_hex.c#L14>)

Decodes a hexadecimal string into a byte array.
- **Inputs**:
    - `_dst`: A pointer to the destination buffer where the decoded bytes will be stored.
    - `hex`: A pointer to the input hexadecimal string to decode.
    - `sz`: The number of bytes to decode from the hexadecimal string.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Initialize `dst` as a pointer to the destination buffer `_dst`.
    - Iterate over the range from 0 to `sz`, incrementing by 1 each time.
    - For each iteration, decode two hexadecimal characters from `hex` using [`fd_hex_unhex`](<#fd_hex_unhex>) to get the high and low nibbles.
    - If either `hi` or `lo` is negative, indicating an invalid character, return the current index `i`.
    - Combine the high and low nibbles into a single byte and store it in the destination buffer `dst`.
    - Increment the `dst` pointer to store the next byte in the next iteration.
    - Return the number of bytes successfully decoded, which is `i`.
- **Output**: Returns the number of bytes successfully decoded from the hexadecimal string.
- **Functions Called**:
    - [`fd_hex_unhex`](<#fd_hex_unhex>)

### fd\_hex\_encode<!-- {{#callable:fd_hex_encode}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/ballet/hex/fd_hex.c#L32>)

Encodes a binary data source into a hexadecimal string representation.
- **Inputs**:
    - `dst`: A pointer to the destination buffer where the hexadecimal string will be stored.
    - `_src`: A pointer to the source binary data to be encoded.
    - `sz`: The size of the source data in bytes.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Cast the source data pointer `_src` to a `uchar` pointer `src`.
    - Define a lookup table `lut` for hexadecimal characters '0' to 'f'.
    - Iterate over each byte in the source data using a loop that runs `sz` times.
    - For each byte, extract the high nibble (4 bits) and low nibble, and map them to hexadecimal characters using the lookup table `lut`.
    - Store the resulting hexadecimal characters in the destination buffer `dst`.
    - Increment the `dst` pointer after storing each character.
    - Return the updated `dst` pointer after processing all bytes.
- **Output**: Returns a pointer to the end of the encoded hexadecimal string in the destination buffer.
