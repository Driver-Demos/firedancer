Function to verify if a byte array contains valid UTF-8 according to Rust's validation rules.

# Purpose
This C header file defines the interface for a function named [`fd_utf8_verify`](<#fd_utf8_verify>), which checks if a byte array contains valid UTF-8 encoded data. The function follows the UTF-8 validation rules similar to those used in Rust's `std::str::from_utf8`, ensuring that each code point is between one and four bytes long and adheres to specific byte ranges for each length. The function does not consider zero bytes as code points, nor does it check if code points are valid Unicode characters. The header file includes necessary dependencies and uses preprocessor directives to prevent multiple inclusions. The function is declared with `FD_FN_PURE`, indicating it has no side effects and its return value depends only on its parameters.

Checks if a byte array contains valid UTF-8.
- **Description**: Use this function to verify if a given byte array adheres to UTF-8 encoding rules. It follows the validation rules similar to Rust's `std::str::from_utf8`, ensuring that each code point is between one to four bytes long and that continuation characters are correctly placed. The function does not check for valid Unicode characters but ensures that zero bytes are treated as valid one-byte code points. Call this function when you need to validate UTF-8 data, especially when handling data that may not be null-terminated or when zero bytes are present. Ensure that the byte array does not overflow beyond the specified size.
- **Inputs**:
    - `str`: A pointer to the first byte of the UTF-8 string. It must not be null unless `sz` is zero. The caller retains ownership, and the function does not modify the data.
    - `sz`: The number of bytes in the string. It must be a non-negative value, and the function assumes that `str + sz` does not overflow.
- **Output**: Returns 1 if the byte array is valid UTF-8, otherwise returns 0.
