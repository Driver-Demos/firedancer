Makefile for adding headers, objects, and unit tests for UTF-8 functionality.

# Purpose
The Makefile content defines build and test instructions for a software project. It adds the header file `fd_utf8.h` and object files `fd_utf8` and `fd_ballet` to the build process. It also specifies a unit test named `test_utf8`, which depends on the `fd_ballet` and `fd_util` components, and includes a command to execute this unit test.
