Tests for binary compatibility of ELF structures and functions for reading C strings in ELF files.

# Purpose
The code is a C source file that performs sanity checks and compatibility assertions for ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) structures and constants. It includes the header `fd_elf64.h` and uses the standard `elf.h` header when compiled on Linux systems. The code uses `FD_STATIC_ASSERT` to verify that custom ELF definitions and structures (`fd_elf64_*`) are binary compatible with the system's ELF definitions and structures (`Elf64_*`). This ensures that the custom ELF handling code can correctly interpret and manipulate ELF files on the system.

Additionally, the code contains a [`main`](<#main>) function that serves as a test suite for the `fd_elf_read_cstr` function. It initializes a static character array `haystack` and performs a series of tests using `FD_TEST` to validate the behavior of `fd_elf_read_cstr` under various conditions, such as undersized, oversized, and out-of-bounds needle searches. The tests check for correct handling of these cases and verify that the function returns expected results. The program logs a notice of "pass" if all tests succeed and then halts execution.
# Imports and Dependencies

### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/ballet/elf/test_elf.c#L138>)

Initializes the environment, performs a series of tests on the [`fd_elf_read_cstr`](<fd_elf.h.md#fd_elf_read_cstr>) function, logs a success message, and then halts the program.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments.
    - `argv`: An array of strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Calls `fd_boot` to initialize the environment with `argc` and `argv`.
    - Defines a static character array `haystack` with specific content for testing.
    - Performs a series of tests using `FD_TEST` to validate the behavior of [`fd_elf_read_cstr`](<fd_elf.h.md#fd_elf_read_cstr>) with different parameters, including edge cases like undersized, oversized, and out-of-bounds needles.
    - Logs a notice message 'pass' using `FD_LOG_NOTICE` if all tests pass.
    - Calls `fd_halt` to terminate the program.
    - Returns 0 to indicate successful execution.
- **Output**: Returns 0 to indicate successful execution.
- **Functions Called**:
    - [`fd_elf_read_cstr`](<fd_elf.h.md#fd_elf_read_cstr>)
