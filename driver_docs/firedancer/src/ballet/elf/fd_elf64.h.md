Defines packed struct types for ELF64 file headers, segments, sections, symbols, relocations, and dynamic entries.

# Purpose
The code is a C header file that defines data structures for handling ELF64 (Executable and Linkable Format) files. It provides a set of `struct` definitions that represent various components of an ELF64 file, such as the file header, program header, section header, symbol table entries, and relocation entries. These structures are essential for parsing and manipulating ELF64 files, which are commonly used in Unix-like operating systems for executables, object code, shared libraries, and core dumps.

The header file includes definitions for `fd_elf64_ehdr`, `fd_elf64_phdr`, `fd_elf64_shdr`, `fd_elf64_sym`, `fd_elf64_rel`, `fd_elf64_rela`, and `fd_elf64_dyn`. Each structure is packed to ensure that there is no padding between fields, which is important for correctly interpreting the binary data in ELF files. The file also includes a note regarding the `fd_elf64_dyn` structure, indicating a deviation from the ELF specification in the Solana ELF loader, where `d_tag` is treated as an unsigned long instead of a signed long. This header file is intended to be included in other C source files that need to work with ELF64 files, providing a standardized way to access and manipulate ELF64 data.
