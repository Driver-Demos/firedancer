Defines constants and functions for handling ELF files, including reading C-style strings.

# Purpose
The code is a C header file that defines constants and functions related to the Executable and Linking Format (ELF), which is a common file format for executables, object code, shared libraries, and core dumps. The file provides a set of macros that define various ELF-related constants, such as file type identifiers (`FD_ELF_ET_*`), machine types (`FD_ELF_EM_*`), and section header types (`FD_ELF_SHT_*`). These constants are used to interpret the structure and contents of ELF files.

Additionally, the file includes a static inline function [`fd_elf_read_cstr`](<#fd_elf_read_cstr>), which is used to validate and read a C-style string from a specified memory region. This function checks if the string is within bounds and returns a pointer to the string if successful, or `NULL` if the operation fails. The header file also includes other headers, such as `fd_elf64.h`, to provide additional ELF-related functionality. The file is intended to be included in other C source files that need to work with ELF files, providing a standardized interface for handling ELF-specific data.

### fd\_elf\_read\_cstr<!-- {{#callable:fd_elf_read_cstr}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/ballet/elf/fd_elf.h#L116>)

Validates and returns a pointer to a C-style string within a specified memory buffer.
- **Inputs**:
    - `buf`: A pointer to the memory buffer that contains the C-style string.
    - `buf_sz`: The size of the memory buffer in bytes.
    - `off`: The offset in bytes from the start of the buffer where the C-style string is expected to begin.
    - `max_sz`: The maximum allowable size for the C-style string, including the null terminator.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Check if the offset `off` is greater than or equal to `buf_sz`; if true, return `NULL` as the offset is out-of-bounds.
    - Calculate the pointer `str` to the start of the C-style string by adding the offset `off` to the base address of `buf`.
    - Determine the size `str_sz` of the remaining buffer from the offset to the end of the buffer.
    - Calculate `n` as the minimum of `str_sz` and `max_sz`.
    - Check if the length of the string up to `n` characters (using `fd_cstr_nlen`) is equal to `n`; if true, return `NULL` as the string is not properly null-terminated within the allowed size.
    - Return the pointer `str` to the start of the C-style string.
- **Output**: A pointer to the first byte of the C-style string in the buffer on success, or `NULL` on failure.
