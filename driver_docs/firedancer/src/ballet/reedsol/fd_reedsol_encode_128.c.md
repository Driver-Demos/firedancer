Auto-generated C code for encoding data and parity shreds using Reed-Solomon error correction.

# Purpose
The code defines a function [`fd_reedsol_private_encode_128`](<#fd_reedsol_private_encode_128>) that is part of a Reed-Solomon encoding process. This function is responsible for generating parity shreds from a given set of data shreds. The function takes in parameters such as the size of each shred, pointers to the data shreds, the count of data shreds, pointers to the parity shreds, and the count of parity shreds. The function uses Galois Field arithmetic to load data shreds into variables, processes them to generate parity shreds, and stores the results in the provided parity shred pointers.

The function is designed to handle up to 128 data shreds and uses a series of switch-case statements to manage different counts of data shreds. It uses macros `ALL_VARS` and `ALL_VARS_REF` to manage the large number of variables involved in the encoding process. The function also includes logic to handle cases where the number of parity shreds required exceeds the initial set of generated parity shreds, by producing additional parity shreds as needed. The function is marked with `FD_FN_UNSANITIZED`, indicating that it may not include certain safety checks, and it is part of a larger system that likely involves error correction and data recovery.

Generates parity shreds from data shreds using Reed-Solomon encoding.
- **Inputs**:
    - `shred_sz`: The size of each shred in bytes.
    - `data_shred`: A pointer to an array of pointers, each pointing to a data shred.
    - `data_shred_cnt`: The number of data shreds.
    - `parity_shred`: A pointer to an array of pointers, each pointing to a parity shred.
    - `parity_shred_cnt`: The number of parity shreds to generate.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Initialize `shred_pos` to 0 and iterate while `shred_pos` is less than `shred_sz`.
    - Load data shreds into `gf_t` variables using [`gf_ldu`](<fd_reedsol_arith_none.h.md#gf_ldu>) for the first 64 data shreds and initialize the rest to zero.
    - Use a switch statement to load additional data shreds based on `data_shred_cnt`.
    - Call the appropriate `fd_reedsol_ppt_128_xx` function based on `data_shred_cnt` to generate initial parity shreds.
    - Calculate `total_shreds` as the sum of `data_shred_cnt` and `parity_shred_cnt`.
    - Store the generated parity shreds into `parity_shred` using a switch statement, ensuring not to exceed `total_shreds`.
    - If more parity shreds are needed, call `FD_REEDSOL_GENERATE_FFT` to generate additional parity shreds and store them.
    - Increment `shred_pos` by `GF_WIDTH` and adjust it if it exceeds `shred_sz` but is less than `shred_sz + GF_WIDTH`.
- **Output**: No direct output; modifies the contents of `parity_shred` to store the generated parity shreds.
- **Functions Called**:
    - [`gf_ldu`](<fd_reedsol_arith_none.h.md#gf_ldu>)
    - [`fd_reedsol_ppt_128_67`](<wrapped_impl/fd_reedsol_ppt_impl_65.c.md#fd_reedsol_ppt_128_67>)

    - [`fd_reedsol_ppt_128_65`](<wrapped_impl/fd_reedsol_ppt_impl_65.c.md#fd_reedsol_ppt_128_65>)
