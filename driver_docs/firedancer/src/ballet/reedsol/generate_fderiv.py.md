Generates a header file for computing the formal derivative of polynomials over GF(2^8) using macros.

# Purpose
The code generates a C header file that implements the formal derivative computation of a polynomial over a finite field, specifically GF(2^8). The main functionality provided by this code is encapsulated in the macro `FD_REEDSOL_GEN_FDERIV`, which computes the formal derivative of a polynomial in a vectorized manner. The code is designed to handle polynomials of specific lengths (16, 32, 64, 128, and 256), which must be powers of 2. The formal derivative is computed by treating the polynomial's variable as a real value, taking the derivative, and then interpreting the result back over the finite field. This operation is useful because it follows the formal equivalent of the product rule.

The code uses the `galois` library to perform operations in the finite field GF(2^8) and `numpy` for numerical computations. It defines several macros and functions to facilitate the generation of the C header file. The macros `FD_REEDSOL_PRIVATE_EXPAND` and `FD_REEDSOL_GENERATE_FDERIV` are used to expand and generate the implementation details for the formal derivative computation. The code also calculates specific values (`svals`, `sbar`, `sbarprime`, and `B`) that are used in the computation of the formal derivative. The [`print_macro`](<#print_macro>) function is used to format and output the macros into the header file. The generated header file is intended to be included in other C source files to provide the formal derivative computation functionality.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `galois`
- `numpy`


# Global Variables

---
### header
- **Type**: ``str``
- **Description**: A multi-line string that contains C preprocessor directives and comments. It defines a header file for computing the formal derivative of a polynomial over a finite field.
- **Use**: Used to write the contents to a file named `fd_reedsol_fderiv.h`.


---
### outf
- **Type**: ``_io.TextIOWrapper``
- **Description**: The `outf` variable is a file object that is opened for writing text to the file `fd_reedsol_fderiv.h`. It is created using the `open` function with the mode `wt`, which stands for write text mode.
- **Use**: Used to write the `header` content and other generated code to the file `fd_reedsol_fderiv.h`.


---
### GF
- **Type**: ``galois.GF``
- **Description**: Represents a Galois Field of order 2^8, which is a finite field with 256 elements. This field is used for arithmetic operations in the context of error correction and cryptography.
- **Use**: Used to perform arithmetic operations over the finite field GF(2^8) in the code.


---
### svals
- **Type**: ``dict``
- **Description**: A dictionary that stores precomputed values for a formal derivative computation over a finite field GF(2^8). The keys are tuples where the first element is an integer `j` (ranging from 0 to 7) and the second element is an integer `x` (ranging from 0 to 255). The values are elements of the Galois field, computed based on the previous values in the dictionary.
- **Use**: Used to store and retrieve precomputed values for efficient polynomial derivative calculations in a finite field.


---
### sbar
- **Type**: ``dict``
- **Description**: A dictionary that stores precomputed values for the formal derivative computation of polynomials over the finite field GF(2^8). The keys are tuples `(j, x)` where `j` is an integer from 0 to 7 and `x` is an integer from 0 to 255. The values are the result of dividing `svals[j, x]` by `svals[j, 1<<j]`, where `svals` is another dictionary containing intermediate computations.
- **Use**: Used to store and retrieve precomputed values for efficient polynomial derivative calculations in the finite field.


---
### sbarprime
- **Type**: `list`
- **Description**: `sbarprime` is a list that stores precomputed values used in the formal derivative computation of polynomials over the finite field GF(2^8). It starts with an initial value of 1 and is populated with additional values calculated using the product of elements in the Galois field divided by specific entries in the `svals` dictionary.
- **Use**: Used to store precomputed values for polynomial derivative calculations in a finite field.


---
### B
- **Type**: ``list``
- **Description**: `B` is a list that contains 256 elements, each of which is a product of certain elements from the `sbarprime` list. The elements in `B` are computed using a loop that iterates over the range of 256, and for each index `i`, a product is calculated by multiplying elements from `sbarprime` based on the binary representation of `i`. The multiplication is performed using the Galois field arithmetic provided by the `galois` library.
- **Use**: Used to store precomputed products of elements from `sbarprime` for use in polynomial derivative computations over a finite field.


# Functions

---
### print\_macro<!-- {{#callable:firedancer/src/ballet/reedsol/generate_fderiv.print_macro}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/ballet/reedsol/generate_fderiv.py#L85>)

Generates and prints a C macro definition with specified arguments and lines of code, formatted with a given indentation.
- **Inputs**:
    - `macro_name`: The name of the macro to define.
    - `args`: A list of argument names for the macro.
    - `lines`: A list of lines of code to include in the macro body.
    - `indent`: An optional integer specifying the number of spaces to use for indentation, defaulting to 2.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Initialize the first line of the macro definition with the macro name and the first argument.
    - Calculate the maximum width for formatting based on the longest line in `lines` plus the indentation and a fixed offset.
    - Iterate over the remaining arguments, appending them to the first line, ensuring the line does not exceed the maximum width, and print the line if it does.
    - Complete the first line with a closing parenthesis and a backslash for continuation, then print it.
    - Initialize the second line with a 'do {' block, formatted to the maximum width, and print it.
    - Iterate over each line in `lines`, format it with indentation and continuation backslashes, and print each line.
    - Print the closing 'while( 0 )' block with indentation and finalize with two newlines.
- **Output**: Writes the formatted macro definition to the file `outf`.
