Defines arithmetic operations for Galois Field using AVX instructions with specific compiler conditions.

# Purpose
The code is a C header file that defines arithmetic operations for Galois Field (GF) computations using SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) instructions, specifically targeting AVX (Advanced Vector Extensions) and GFNI (Galois Field New Instructions) capabilities. It is part of a larger library related to Reed-Solomon error correction, as indicated by the file path and naming conventions. The file includes type definitions, macros, and function-like macros for loading, storing, and performing arithmetic operations such as addition and multiplication in a Galois Field. The use of SIMD instructions allows for efficient parallel processing of data, which is crucial for high-performance computing tasks like error correction.

The header file is not intended to be included directly by other source files; instead, it should be included through `fd_reedsol_private.h`, as enforced by the preprocessor directive. The file defines several macros for Galois Field operations, such as `GF_ADD`, `GF_OR`, and `GF_MUL`, which utilize AVX and GFNI instructions to perform operations on wide vectors (`wb_t`). The file also includes conditional compilation to handle differences in compiler versions, particularly addressing a known issue with older versions of GCC related to the `_mm256_gf2p8affine_epi64_epi8` intrinsic. This ensures compatibility and correct functionality across different compiler environments.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `../../util/simd/fd_avx.h`


# Global Variables

### fd\_reedsol\_arith\_consts\_gfni\_mul
- **Type**: ``uchar const[]``
- **Description**: An external constant array of unsigned characters, aligned to 128 bytes. It is used in arithmetic operations related to Galois Field (GF) multiplication with the `gfni` (Galois Field New Instructions) extension.
- **Use**: Used to load constants for Galois Field multiplication operations in functions like `GF_MUL` and `GF_MUL_VAR`.
