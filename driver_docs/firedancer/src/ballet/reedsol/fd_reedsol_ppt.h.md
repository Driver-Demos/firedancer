Processes 64 input elements for Reed-Solomon encoding.
- **Description**: Use this function to perform Reed-Solomon encoding on 64 input elements. Each input element is a pointer to a `gf_t` type, which represents a Galois Field element. The function modifies the input elements in place, so ensure that the input pointers are valid and point to writable memory. This function does not perform any input validation, so the caller must ensure that all pointers are non-null and correctly initialized before calling. It is typically used in error correction coding scenarios where data integrity is critical.

Provides macros and functions for Reed-Solomon error correction using Galois Field arithmetic.

# Purpose
The code is a header file that implements the Principal Pivot Transform (PPT) for the Reed-Solomon Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) operator, specifically designed for cases where the number of data shreds is not a power of 2. It provides macros and function declarations to handle Reed-Solomon error correction, using Galois Field arithmetic for encoding and decoding processes. The main macro, `FD_REEDSOL_GENERATE_PPT`, generates code to compute the PPT for various sizes and known elements in the evaluation domain. The macros, such as `FD_REEDSOL_PPT_IMPL_n_k`, are auto-generated for specific values of `n` and `k`, performing vectorized operations necessary for the PPT. Functions like `fd_reedsol_ppt_64_36` and `fd_reedsol_ppt_64_62` are declared to operate on `gf_t` arrays, representing elements in a Galois Field, and are intended to be used as public APIs for encoding and decoding data. The code is structured to support error correction in data systems, focusing on configurations with 64 data inputs and varying parity inputs, and includes operations like `GF_MUL`, `GF_ADD`, and FFT/IFFT transformations.

Processes 64 input elements using a Reed-Solomon algorithm.
- **Description**: Use this function to apply a Reed-Solomon error correction algorithm to 64 input elements. Each input element is a pointer to a `gf_t` type, which represents a Galois field element. The function modifies the input elements in place, so the caller must ensure that the input pointers are valid and point to writable memory. This function does not return a value, and it assumes that all input pointers are non-null and correctly initialized before the call.

Processes 64 input elements using a Reed-Solomon algorithm.
- **Description**: Use this function to apply a Reed-Solomon error correction algorithm to 64 input elements. Each input element is a pointer to a `gf_t` type, which represents a Galois Field element. The function modifies the input elements in place, so the caller must ensure that the input pointers are valid and point to writable memory. This function does not perform any input validation, so it is the caller's responsibility to provide valid inputs.

Generates a Reed-Solomon parity for 64 input elements.
- **Description**: Use this function to compute the Reed-Solomon parity for a set of 64 input elements, where each element is a pointer to a `gf_t` type.

Processes 64 input elements for Reed-Solomon encoding.
- **Description**: Use this function to perform Reed-Solomon encoding on 64 input elements. Each input element is a pointer to a `gf_t` type, which represents a Galois Field element.

This function does not perform any input validation, so it is the caller's responsibility to provide valid inputs.

Processes 64 input elements for Reed-Solomon encoding.
- **Description**: Use this function to perform Reed-Solomon encoding on 64 input elements. Each input element is a pointer to a `gf_t` type, which represents a Galois Field element. The function modifies the input elements in place, so ensure that the input pointers are valid and point to writable memory. This function does not perform any input validation, so the caller must ensure that all pointers are non-null and correctly initialized before calling. It is typically used in error correction coding scenarios where data integrity is critical.

Processes 128 input elements for Reed-Solomon encoding.
- **Description**: Use this function to process 128 input elements for Reed-Solomon encoding. Each input element is a pointer to a `gf_t` type, which represents a Galois Field element. The function reads the values from these pointers, processes them, and writes the results back to the same memory locations. Ensure that all input pointers are valid and point to allocated memory before calling this function. The function does not return a value, and it modifies the input data in place.

[View Source →](<../../../../../src/ballet/reedsol/fd_reedsol_ppt.h#L9535>)

Processes 128 input elements using a Reed-Solomon algorithm.
- **Description**: Use this function to apply a Reed-Solomon error correction algorithm to 128 input elements. This function requires 128 pointers to `gf_t` elements as input. Each pointer must not be null, and the caller must ensure that the memory locations pointed to by these pointers are valid and writable. The function modifies the values at these memory locations. It is important to ensure that the input pointers are correctly initialized before calling this function.
