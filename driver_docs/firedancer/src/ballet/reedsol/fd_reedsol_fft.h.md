Implements FFT and IFFT operations for Reed-Solomon codes on Galois Field elements.

# Purpose
The header file implements an FFT-like operator for Reed-Solomon erasure codes, providing macros and functions to perform transformations between two polynomial bases: the "evaluation basis" and the "coefficient basis". The main macros, `FD_REEDSOL_GENERATE_FFT` and `FD_REEDSOL_GENERATE_IFFT`, generate code for forward and inverse transformations, respectively, similar to the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT) but applied to polynomials in a finite field (GF(2^8)). The code includes vectorized transformations, operating on each byte of the input independently, and uses butterfly operations, which are fundamental to FFT algorithms. It defines macros for different sizes of FFT/IFFT operations and provides constants for the necessary coefficients. The functions `fd_reedsol_fft_*` and `fd_reedsol_ifft_*` perform these operations on arrays of Galois Field elements. This code is part of a library for error correction in data transmission and storage systems, intended to be included in other C programs that require these mathematical operations.

Performs an inverse fast Fourier transform on 256 Galois field elements.
- **Description**: Use this function to perform an inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) on 256 elements in a Galois field. This function takes 256 pointers to `gf_t` elements as input, processes them, and updates the values at the provided memory locations. Ensure that all input pointers are valid and point to initialized `gf_t` elements before calling this function. The function does not return a value but modifies the data at the input pointers.

[View Source →](<../../../../../src/ballet/reedsol/fd_reedsol_fft.h#L2264>)

Performs a 256-point Reed-Solomon FFT transformation on input data.
- **Description**: Use this function to apply a 256-point Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to a set of input data represented by Galois Field elements. This function is typically used in error correction algorithms, such as those found in data transmission and storage systems. Ensure that all input pointers are valid and point to initialized `gf_t` elements before calling this function. The function modifies the input data in place, so the caller must ensure that the input data is correctly set up and that the pointers are not null.

[View Source →](<../../../../../src/ballet/reedsol/fd_reedsol_fft.h#L2743>)

Performs an inverse fast Fourier transform on 128 Galois field elements.
- **Description**: Use this function to apply an inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) on 128 input elements represented in a Galois field. This operation is typically used in error correction algorithms such as Reed-Solomon codes. Ensure that all input pointers are valid and point to initialized `gf_t` elements. The function modifies the input elements in place, so the caller must ensure that the input data is correctly set up before calling this function. This function does not return a value, and it assumes that the input pointers are not null.

[View Source →](<../../../../../src/ballet/reedsol/fd_reedsol_fft.h#L3223>)

Performs a Reed-Solomon FFT on 128 input elements.
- **Description**: Use this function to apply a Reed-Solomon Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) on 128 input elements. Each input element is a pointer to a `gf_t` type, which represents a Galois Field element. The function reads the values from these pointers, processes them, and writes the transformed values back to the same memory locations. Ensure that all input pointers are valid and point to allocated memory before calling this function. This function does not return a value, and it modifies the input data in place.

[View Source →](<../../../../../src/ballet/reedsol/fd_reedsol_fft.h#L3224>)

Performs a 128-point Fast Fourier Transform on input data.
- **Description**: Use this function to apply a 128-point Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) on a set of input data points. The function requires exactly 128 input pointers, each pointing to a `gf_t` type. The function modifies the data at these pointers to store the transformed results. Ensure that all input pointers are valid and point to allocated memory before calling this function. This function does not return a value, and it directly modifies the input data in place.

Performs an inverse fast Fourier transform on 64 input elements.
- **Description**: Use this function to apply an inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) on 64 elements of type `gf_t`. Each input element is provided as a pointer, and the function modifies the values in place.

Performs an inverse fast Fourier transform on 64 input elements.
- **Description**: Use this function to apply an inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) to a set of 64 elements. Each input element is a pointer to a `gf_t` type, which represents a Galois field element. The function modifies the input elements in place, so the caller must ensure that the input pointers are valid and point to writable memory. This function is typically used in error correction and data recovery processes where IFFT is required. Ensure that all input pointers are non-null before calling this function.

[View Source →](<../../../../../src/ballet/reedsol/fd_reedsol_fft.h#L3649>)

Performs a 64-point Reed-Solomon FFT on input data.
- **Description**: Use this function to apply a 64-point Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to a set of input data represented by Galois Field elements. This function modifies the input data in place, so ensure that the input pointers are valid and point to writable memory. The function expects exactly 64 input pointers, each pointing to a `gf_t` element. It is important to provide valid pointers to avoid undefined behavior. This function does not return a value, and all results are stored back in the input locations.
