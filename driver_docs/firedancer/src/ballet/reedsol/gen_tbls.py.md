Generates and writes Galois field constant tables for GFNI, AVX, and generic use to binary files.

# Purpose
The code is a script that generates and writes several binary constant tables used for mathematical operations in Galois fields, specifically GF(2^8). It uses the `galois` library to perform operations in the Galois field and `numpy` for matrix manipulations. The script creates three different binary files: `gfni_constants.bin`, `avx2_constants.bin`, and `generic_constants.bin`, each containing precomputed constants for efficient arithmetic operations.

The script defines a function [`gen_vgf2p8affineqb_matrix`](<#gen_vgf2p8affineqb_matrix>) to generate affine transformation matrices for the Galois field. It then computes and writes constants for GFNI (Galois Field New Instructions) and AVX2 (Advanced Vector Extensions 2) operations. Additionally, it generates a generic constant table that includes logarithm and inverse logarithm tables for efficient multiplication operations. The script ensures that these tables handle special cases, such as multiplication by zero and overflow conditions, by mapping specific values in the logarithm tables. The output is stored in the specified directory `constants/`.

### out\_dir
- **Type**: ``str``
- **Description**: A string variable that specifies the directory path where output files are saved. The path is set to 'constants/'.
- **Use**: Used to define the directory path for writing binary files containing constant tables.


---
### GF
- **Type**: ``galois.GF``
- **Description**: Represents a Galois Field of order 2^8, which is a finite field used in error correction and cryptography. The Galois Field is initialized using the `galois` library, which provides operations over finite fields.

---
### data\_shreds
- **Type**: ``int``
- **Description**: Represents the number of data shreds used in the construction of the `rust_matrix1` matrix. It is a constant value set to 32.
- **Use**: Used to define the dimensions of the `rust_matrix1` matrix and to slice it for further matrix operations.


---
### total\_shreds
- **Type**: ``int``
- **Description**: The variable `total_shreds` is an integer that represents the total number of shreds used in the construction of the Galois Field matrix `rust_matrix1`. It is set to the value 64.
- **Use**: Used to define the range for the outer loop in the list comprehension that constructs `rust_matrix1`.


---
### rust\_matrix1
- **Type**: ``GF``
- **Description**: A Galois Field matrix created using the `galois.GF` function, which represents a finite field of order 2^8. The matrix is constructed with dimensions defined by `total_shreds` and `data_shreds`, where each element is computed as `GF(i)**j` for indices `i` and `j`. This matrix is used in operations involving finite field arithmetic.
- **Use**: Used to perform matrix operations in a Galois Field, specifically for encoding and decoding processes in the context of data shreds.


---
### full\_matrix
- **Type**: ``np.ndarray``
- **Description**: The variable `full_matrix` is a NumPy array that results from the matrix multiplication of a submatrix of `rust_matrix1` and the inverse of another submatrix of `rust_matrix1`. Specifically, it multiplies the submatrix from row `data_shreds` to the end with the inverse of the submatrix from the start to row `data_shreds`. This operation is performed using the `@` operator, which denotes matrix multiplication in NumPy.
- **Use**: Used to store the result of a matrix operation involving `rust_matrix1` for further processing or output.


---
### bytes\_to\_multiply
- **Type**: ``range``
- **Description**: Represents a sequence of numbers from 0 to 255. This sequence is used to iterate over each byte value in the range of possible byte values.
- **Use**: Used to generate a list of byte values for processing in the `gen_vgf2p8affineqb_matrix` function.


---
### encoded
- **Type**: `list`
- **Description**: A list of encoded data generated by multiplying a reshaped array of integers from 0 to 255 with a Galois Field matrix. The multiplication uses the `GF` function from the `galois` library to perform operations in the Galois Field of order 256.
- **Use**: Used to store the result of the Galois Field multiplication for writing to a binary file.


---
### shuffle\_idx
- **Type**: ``numpy.ndarray``
- **Description**: `shuffle_idx` is a NumPy array created by tiling a sequence of integers from 0 to 15, resulting in a 1x32 array of 32-bit integers. The `np.tile` function replicates the sequence twice along the second dimension.
- **Use**: Used to define a constant index pattern for data manipulation in the encoding process.


---
### logtbl
- **Type**: ``list``
- **Description**: A list of 256 integers initialized to zero. It is used to store logarithmic values for elements in a Galois Field (GF) of size 2^8. The first element is set to -256 to handle multiplication by zero, and the rest are populated with logarithmic values of the primitive element raised to various powers.
- **Use**: Used to map elements of the Galois Field to their logarithmic values for efficient multiplication operations.


---
### invlogtbl
- **Type**: ``list``
- **Description**: A list of 1024 integers initialized to zero, used to store inverse logarithm values for a Galois Field (GF) arithmetic operation. The list is indexed with an offset of 512 to accommodate specific mapping requirements for multiplication operations in the GF.
- **Use**: Stores inverse logarithm values for efficient multiplication operations in Galois Field arithmetic.


---
### pe
- **Type**: ``GF.primitive_element``
- **Description**: Represents the primitive element of the Galois Field `GF(2**8)`. A primitive element is a generator of the multiplicative group of the field, meaning that its powers can generate all non-zero elements of the field.

---
### gf\_log
- **Type**: ``numpy.vectorize``
- **Description**: Applies a vectorized function to elements of an input array. The function uses a lambda function to map each element `v` of the input to its corresponding logarithmic value from the `logtbl` list.
- **Use**: Used to transform elements of `full_matrix` into their logarithmic values for further processing in the `log_matrix`.


---
### log\_matrix
- **Type**: ``GFArray``
- **Description**: Represents a Galois Field array created by applying the `gf_log` function to the `full_matrix`. The `gf_log` function uses a logarithm table (`logtbl`) to transform elements of the `full_matrix` into their logarithmic equivalents in the Galois Field.
- **Use**: Used to store the logarithmic transformation of the `full_matrix` for further operations or storage.

[View Source →](<../../../../../src/ballet/reedsol/gen_tbls.py#L14>)

Generates a matrix by multiplying a given element with powers of a Galois Field element and combines the results into a single integer.
- **Inputs**:
    - `c`: A Galois Field element to multiply with powers of 2.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Initialize an empty list `out_t` to store intermediate results.
    - Iterate over a range of 8, multiplying `c` by `GF(1<<j)` and append the result to `out_t`.
    - Initialize `out_w` to 0 to accumulate the final result.
    - Iterate over a range of 64, checking if the bitwise AND of `out_t[i%8]` and `(1<<(7-i//8))` is non-zero.
    - If the condition is true, update `out_w` by setting the bit at position `i`.
- **Output**: An integer `out_w` representing the combined result of the operations.
