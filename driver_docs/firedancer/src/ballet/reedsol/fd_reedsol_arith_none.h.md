Defines arithmetic operations for Galois Field elements using lookup tables in the Firedancer codebase.

# Purpose
This C header file defines arithmetic operations for a Galois Field with a width of one byte, stored in an `ulong`. It includes type definitions and macros for basic operations such as addition (`GF_ADD`), logical OR (`GF_OR`), and multiplication (`GF_MUL`, `GF_MUL_VAR`) within the field. The file uses lookup tables for logarithmic and inverse logarithmic operations to facilitate multiplication. It also includes inline functions for loading and storing Galois Field elements from and to memory. The file is intended to be included indirectly through `fd_reedsol_private.h`, ensuring proper dependency management.
# Global Variables

---
### fd\_reedsol\_arith\_consts\_generic\_mul
- **Type**: ``uchar const[]``
- **Description**: An external constant array of unsigned characters, aligned to 128 bytes. It is used in Galois Field arithmetic operations, specifically for multiplication.
- **Use**: Used as a lookup table for Galois Field multiplication operations in Reed-Solomon error correction algorithms.


---
### gf\_arith\_log\_tbl
- **Type**: ``short const *``
- **Description**: Points to a table of logarithmic values used in Galois Field arithmetic operations. The table is indexed from 0 to 256 and is used to facilitate multiplication operations in the Galois Field.
- **Use**: Used to access logarithmic values for Galois Field multiplication operations.


---
### gf\_arith\_invlog\_tbl
- **Type**: ``uchar const *``
- **Description**: Points to a location in the `fd_reedsol_arith_consts_generic_mul` array, offset by 256 times the size of a `short` and 512 times the size of a `uchar`. It is used to access elements in the range of [-512, 512) for arithmetic operations.
- **Use**: Used in Galois Field arithmetic operations to retrieve inverse logarithm values for multiplication.


# Functions

---
### gf\_ldu<!-- {{#callable:gf_ldu}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/ballet/reedsol/fd_reedsol_arith_none.h#L13>)

Loads a byte from a given memory address and returns it as an unsigned long.
- **Inputs**:
    - `addr`: A pointer to an unsigned character (`uchar const *`) representing the memory address from which to load the byte.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Dereferences the pointer `addr` to access the byte stored at the given memory address.
    - Casts the dereferenced byte to an `ulong` type.
    - Returns the casted value.
- **Output**: Returns the byte at the specified memory address as an `ulong`.


---
### gf\_stu<!-- {{#callable:gf_stu}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/ballet/reedsol/fd_reedsol_arith_none.h#L16>)

Stores a Galois field element into a memory address.
- **Inputs**:
    - ``addr``: A pointer to the memory location where the Galois field element will be stored.
    - ``v``: The Galois field element to store, represented as a `gf_t` type.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Casts the Galois field element `v` from `gf_t` to `uchar`.
    - Stores the casted value into the memory location pointed to by `addr`.
- **Output**: No return value; the function modifies the memory location pointed to by `addr`.
