Auto-generated C code for recovering data using Reed-Solomon error correction with 256 shreds.

# Purpose
The code defines a function [`fd_reedsol_private_recover_var_256`](<#fd_reedsol_private_recover_var_256>), which is part of a Reed-Solomon error correction implementation. This function is responsible for recovering data from a set of shreds, which are fragments of data that include both original data and parity information. The function takes parameters such as the size of each shred, pointers to the shreds, the count of data and parity shreds, and an array indicating which shreds are erased. The function uses these inputs to attempt to reconstruct the original data by leveraging the properties of Reed-Solomon codes, which are capable of correcting errors and recovering lost data.

The function operates by first determining which shreds are available and which are erased. It then generates a permutation index (`pi`) based on the erased shreds and performs a series of operations involving loading, multiplying, and transforming the data using finite field arithmetic. The function checks for data integrity by comparing regenerated shreds with existing ones and returns an error code if any discrepancies are found. The function uses several helper functions and macros, such as `GF_MUL_VAR`, `fd_reedsol_ifft_256_0`, and `fd_reedsol_fft_256_0`, to perform the necessary mathematical operations. The function is part of a broader library for error correction and is not intended to be used as a standalone executable.

Recovers data from shreds using Reed-Solomon error correction by processing erased and non-erased shreds.
- **Inputs**:
    - `shred_sz`: The size of each shred in bytes.
    - `shred`: A pointer to an array of pointers, each pointing to a shred of data.
    - `data_shred_cnt`: The number of data shreds.
    - `parity_shred_cnt`: The number of parity shreds.
    - `erased`: An array indicating which shreds are erased (1) and which are not (0).
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Initialize arrays `_erased` and `pi` to track erased shreds and permutation indices.
    - Calculate the total number of shreds as the sum of data and parity shreds.
    - Iterate over 256 possible shreds to determine which shreds to load based on the `erased` array and update `_erased` and `loaded_cnt`.
    - If the number of loaded shreds is less than `data_shred_cnt`, return `FD_REEDSOL_ERR_PARTIAL`.
    - Generate permutation indices using [`fd_reedsol_private_gen_pi_256`](<fd_reedsol_pi.c.md#fd_reedsol_private_gen_pi_256>).
    - Initialize `diff` to zero to track differences in regenerated shreds.
    - Iterate over each position in the shreds, loading non-erased shreds into variables and setting erased ones to zero.
    - Multiply each loaded shred by its corresponding permutation index.
    - Perform inverse FFT, derivative generation, and FFT on the loaded shreds.
    - Multiply the erased shreds by their permutation indices again.
    - Use a switch statement to handle storing, comparing, and reloading shreds based on their erased status.
    - If any differences are detected in the regenerated shreds, return `FD_REEDSOL_ERR_CORRUPT`.
    - Advance the shred position by `GF_WIDTH` and adjust if necessary.
    - Return `FD_REEDSOL_SUCCESS` if all operations complete without error.
- **Output**: Returns an integer status code: `FD_REEDSOL_SUCCESS` on successful recovery, `FD_REEDSOL_ERR_PARTIAL` if not enough data shreds are loaded, or `FD_REEDSOL_ERR_CORRUPT` if a corruption is detected.
