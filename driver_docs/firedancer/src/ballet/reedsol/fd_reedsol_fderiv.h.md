Auto-generated macros for computing the formal derivative of polynomials over GF(2^8).

# Purpose
The code in this file is a C header file that provides functionality for computing the formal derivative of a polynomial over a finite field, specifically GF(2^8). The primary macro defined in this file is `FD_REEDSOL_GEN_FDERIV`, which is used to generate code for computing the formal derivative of a polynomial of a specified length. The polynomial is represented in the coefficient basis, and the derivative is computed in a vectorized manner. The file includes several implementation macros, such as `FD_REEDSOL_FDERIV_IMPL_16`, `FD_REEDSOL_FDERIV_IMPL_32`, `FD_REEDSOL_FDERIV_IMPL_64`, `FD_REEDSOL_FDERIV_IMPL_128`, and `FD_REEDSOL_FDERIV_IMPL_256`, each corresponding to different polynomial lengths that are powers of 2.

The macros in this file perform operations on polynomials by treating the variable `x` as if it were a real value, taking the derivative, and then reinterpreting the result over the finite field. The macros use operations like `GF_MUL` and `GF_ADD` to perform multiplication and addition in the finite field. The file is auto-generated and includes detailed implementation for each polynomial length, ensuring that the formal derivative is computed correctly according to the rules of the finite field. The file also includes a private macro `FD_REEDSOL_PRIVATE_EXPAND` to facilitate the expansion of the derivative computation macros.
