Auto-generated C code for encoding data and parity shreds using Reed-Solomon error correction.

# Purpose
The code defines a function [`fd_reedsol_private_encode_16`](<#fd_reedsol_private_encode_16>) that is part of an auto-generated file. This function is responsible for encoding data using Reed-Solomon error correction codes. It takes in a specified number of data shreds and parity shreds, and it generates parity shreds based on the input data shreds. The function uses a series of operations involving Galois Field arithmetic to compute the parity shreds, which are essential for data recovery in the event of data loss or corruption.

The function operates by iterating over the data shreds and applying a series of transformations, including inverse fast Fourier transforms (IFFT) and fast Fourier transforms (FFT), to generate the required parity shreds. The function handles different numbers of data shreds by using a switch-case structure to apply the appropriate operations for each case. The function also includes logic to handle cases where the number of parity shreds required exceeds the initial set of generated parity shreds, by producing additional parity shreds as needed. The function is marked with `FD_FN_UNSANITIZED`, indicating that it may not perform input validation or error checking, and it is intended for internal use within a larger system that implements Reed-Solomon encoding.

[View Source →](<../../../../../src/ballet/reedsol/fd_reedsol_encode_16.c#L4>)

Encodes data shreds into parity shreds using Reed-Solomon encoding with a maximum of 16 data shreds.
- **Inputs**:
    - `shred_sz`: The size of each shred in bytes.
    - `data_shred`: A pointer to an array of pointers, each pointing to a data shred.
    - `data_shred_cnt`: The number of data shreds.
    - `parity_shred`: A pointer to an array of pointers, each pointing to a parity shred.
    - `parity_shred_cnt`: The number of parity shreds to produce.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Initialize 16 Galois field variables to zero.
    - Iterate over each position in the shreds up to `shred_sz`.
    - Load data shreds into Galois field variables based on `data_shred_cnt`.
    - Use a switch statement to apply different Reed-Solomon encoding functions (`FD_REEDSOL_GENERATE_IFFT` or `FD_REEDSOL_GENERATE_PPT`) based on `data_shred_cnt`.
    - Calculate the total number of shreds and store the generated parity shreds into `parity_shred` array.
    - If more parity shreds are needed, generate additional parity shreds using `FD_REEDSOL_GENERATE_FFT` and store them.
    - Repeat the process until all required parity shreds are produced.
    - Adjust `shred_pos` to handle shred sizes not divisible by 32.
- **Output**: No direct output; the function modifies the `parity_shred` array in place to store the generated parity shreds.
- **Functions Called**:
    - [`gf_ldu`](<fd_reedsol_arith_none.h.md#gf_ldu>)
    - [`gf_stu`](<fd_reedsol_arith_none.h.md#gf_stu>)
