Auto-generated C code for 128-point forward and inverse Reed-Solomon FFT implementations.

# Purpose
The code defines two functions, [`fd_reedsol_fft_128_128`](<#fd_reedsol_fft_128_128>) and [`fd_reedsol_ifft_128_128`](<#fd_reedsol_ifft_128_128>), which perform forward and inverse Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT) on 128 input elements, respectively. These functions are part of a Reed-Solomon error correction implementation, as indicated by the inclusion of the header file `fd_reedsol_fft.h`. The functions take pointers to 128 elements of type `gf_t`, which likely represent elements in a Galois Field, a mathematical structure used in error correction algorithms.

The functions use macros `FD_REEDSOL_GENERATE_FFT` and `FD_REEDSOL_GENERATE_IFFT` to perform the actual FFT and inverse FFT operations. The input elements are first dereferenced and stored in local variables, then processed by the macros, and finally, the results are written back to the original memory locations. This code is auto-generated, which suggests that it is part of a larger system where similar functions are generated for different configurations or parameters. The functions do not define public APIs or external interfaces directly but are likely used internally within a library or application that implements Reed-Solomon error correction.
