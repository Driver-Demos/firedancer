Auto-generated C code for 64-point forward and inverse Reed-Solomon FFT implementations.

# Purpose
The code defines two functions, [`fd_reedsol_fft_64_64`](<#fd_reedsol_fft_64_64>) and [`fd_reedsol_ifft_64_64`](<#fd_reedsol_ifft_64_64>), which perform Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT) operations on 64 input elements, respectively. These functions are part of a Reed-Solomon error correction implementation, as indicated by the inclusion of the header file `fd_reedsol_fft.h`. The functions take pointers to 64 elements of type `gf_t`, which likely represent elements in a Galois Field, a mathematical structure commonly used in error correction algorithms.

The functions use macros `FD_REEDSOL_GENERATE_FFT` and `FD_REEDSOL_GENERATE_IFFT` to perform the actual FFT and IFFT computations. The input elements are first dereferenced and stored in local variables, then processed by the macros, and finally, the results are written back to the original memory locations. This code is auto-generated, suggesting it is part of a larger system where such transformations are systematically applied to data for error correction purposes. The functions do not define public APIs or external interfaces directly but are likely intended to be used within a larger library or application that handles data encoding and decoding.
