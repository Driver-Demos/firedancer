Auto-generated C code for 256-point Reed-Solomon FFT and inverse FFT implementations.

# Purpose
The code defines two functions, [`fd_reedsol_fft_256_0`](<#fd_reedsol_fft_256_0>) and [`fd_reedsol_ifft_256_0`](<#fd_reedsol_ifft_256_0>), which perform forward and inverse Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT) on 256 input elements, respectively. These functions are part of a Reed-Solomon error correction implementation, as indicated by the inclusion of the header file `fd_reedsol_fft.h`. The functions take pointers to 256 elements of type `gf_t`, which likely represent elements in a Galois Field, a mathematical structure commonly used in error correction algorithms.

The functions are auto-generated and use macros `FD_REEDSOL_GENERATE_FFT` and `FD_REEDSOL_GENERATE_IFFT` to perform the actual FFT and inverse FFT operations. The input elements are first dereferenced and stored in local variables, then processed by the macros, and finally, the results are written back to the original memory locations. This code is intended to be part of a larger library and does not define a public API or external interface directly. Instead, it provides specific functionality for FFT operations within the context of Reed-Solomon error correction.

    - Call the macro `FD_REEDSOL_GENERATE_IFFT` with the initialized variables to perform the IFFT operation.
    - Store the results back into the original memory locations by updating the values pointed to by `_in00` to `_in255`.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value but updates the input pointers with the IFFT results.
