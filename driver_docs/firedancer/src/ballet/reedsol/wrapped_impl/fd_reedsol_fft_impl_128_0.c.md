Auto-generated C code for 128-point forward and inverse Reed-Solomon FFT operations.

# Purpose
The code defines two functions, [`fd_reedsol_fft_128_0`](<#fd_reedsol_fft_128_0>) and [`fd_reedsol_ifft_128_0`](<#fd_reedsol_ifft_128_0>), which perform Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT) operations, respectively, on 128 input elements. These functions are part of a Reed-Solomon error correction implementation, as indicated by the inclusion of the header file `fd_reedsol_fft.h`. The functions take pointers to 128 elements of type `gf_t`, which likely represent elements in a Galois Field, a mathematical structure commonly used in error correction algorithms.

The functions are auto-generated and use macros `FD_REEDSOL_GENERATE_FFT` and `FD_REEDSOL_GENERATE_IFFT` to perform the core FFT and IFFT operations. The input elements are first dereferenced and stored in local variables, then processed by the macros, and finally written back to the original memory locations. This code is intended to be part of a larger library and does not define a public API or external interface directly. Instead, it provides specific functionality for FFT and IFFT operations within the context of Reed-Solomon encoding and decoding.
