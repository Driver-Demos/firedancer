Header file for AVX2-optimized arithmetic operations in Reed-Solomon error correction.

# Purpose
The code is a C header file that provides arithmetic operations for Galois Field computations using AVX2 SIMD instructions. It is part of a larger library related to Reed-Solomon error correction, as indicated by the file path and naming conventions. The file defines types and macros for performing operations such as loading, storing, zeroing, addition, logical OR, and multiplication in a Galois Field. The use of AVX2 instructions suggests that the operations are optimized for performance on processors that support these instructions.

The header file includes a dependency on another header, `fd_reedsol_private.h`, and it is not intended to be included directly by other files. It defines a type `gf_t` as an alias for `wb_t`, which is likely a vector type used for SIMD operations. The file also declares an external constant array `fd_reedsol_arith_consts_avx_mul` and defines a static array `fd_reedsol_arith_scale4` for internal use. The macros `GF_MUL` and `GF_MUL_VAR` perform multiplication in the Galois Field, leveraging AVX2 intrinsics for efficient computation. The file is structured to allow the optimizer to use these operations at compile time, enhancing performance.
# Imports and Dependencies

### fd\_reedsol\_arith\_consts\_avx\_mul
- **Type**: ``uchar const[]``
- **Description**: An external constant array of unsigned characters, aligned to 128 bytes, used in arithmetic operations for Reed-Solomon error correction with AVX2 instructions.
- **Use**: Used in the `GF_MUL` and `GF_MUL_VAR` macros to perform efficient multiplication operations in Galois Field arithmetic.


---
### fd\_reedsol\_arith\_scale4
- **Type**: ``uchar const[256UL]``
- **Description**: A static constant array of unsigned characters with 256 elements. It contains precomputed values used for arithmetic operations in Reed-Solomon coding.
- **Use**: Used in Galois Field multiplication operations to optimize calculations by providing precomputed scaling factors.
