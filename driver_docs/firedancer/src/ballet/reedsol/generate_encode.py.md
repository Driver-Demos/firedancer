Generates C code for Reed-Solomon encoding functions with varying data and parity shred counts.

# Purpose
The code is a Python script that generates C source files for encoding data using Reed-Solomon error correction. The primary function, [`make_encode`](<#make_encode>), creates a C file named `fd_reedsol_encode_<n>.c`, where `<n>` is a power of two derived from the `max_data_shreds` parameter. The script writes C code that defines a function to encode data shreds and generate parity shreds, which are used for error correction. The function [`cprint`](<#cprint>) is used to manage indentation and format the output to the C file.

The script generates multiple C functions for different ranges of data shreds, as indicated by the calls to [`make_encode`](<#make_encode>) with varying parameters. Each generated function includes logic to handle different numbers of data shreds and parity shreds, using macros and function calls to perform operations like loading data, generating parity, and storing results. The script uses global variables and file operations to manage the output, and it includes logic to handle specific cases, such as when the number of shreds is not divisible by 32. The generated C code is intended to be part of a larger system that uses Reed-Solomon encoding for data integrity and recovery.
# Global Variables

---
### indent
- **Type**: ``int``
- **Description**: The `indent` variable is an integer that represents the current level of indentation for formatted output. It is used to adjust the indentation level when printing strings that contain opening or closing braces.
- **Use**: Used to control the indentation level in the `cprint` function for formatted output.


# Functions

---
### cprint<!-- {{#callable:firedancer/src/ballet/reedsol/generate_encode.cprint}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/ballet/reedsol/generate_encode.py#L2>)

Formats and prints a string with indentation based on the presence of curly braces.
- **Inputs**:
    - `string`: The string to print, which may contain curly braces to adjust indentation.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Checks if the input `string` contains a closing curly brace '}'.
    - If a closing curly brace is found, decreases the global `indent` variable by 1.
    - Prints the `string` with indentation determined by the current value of `indent`, using two spaces per indentation level.
    - Checks if the input `string` contains an opening curly brace '{'.
    - If an opening curly brace is found, increases the global `indent` variable by 1.
- **Output**: Prints the formatted string to the file object `outf` with the specified indentation.

### make\_encode<!-- {{#callable:firedancer/src/ballet/reedsol/generate_encode.make_encode}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/ballet/reedsol/generate_encode.py#L10>)

Generates a C source file for encoding data and parity shreds using Reed-Solomon error correction.
- **Inputs**:
    - `min_data_shreds`: The minimum number of data shreds to consider.
    - `max_data_shreds`: The maximum number of data shreds to consider.
    - `max_parity_shreds`: The maximum number of parity shreds to generate.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Calculate `n` as the smallest power of 2 greater than or equal to `max_data_shreds`.
    - Open a file named `fd_reedsol_encode_{n}.c` for writing.
    - Write the initial C code structure including headers and function signature.
    - Initialize variables for data shreds and set unused variables to zero.
    - Use a switch statement to load data shreds based on `data_shred_cnt`.
    - Define macros `ALL_VARS` and `ALL_VARS_REF` for variable references.
    - Use a switch statement to generate parity shreds using IFFT or PPT based on `data_shred_cnt`.
    - Calculate `total_shreds` and use a switch statement to store parity shreds.
    - Calculate `parity_produced` and `parity_remaining`.
    - Use a loop to generate additional parity shreds if `parity_remaining` is greater than zero.
    - Adjust `shred_pos` to handle shred sizes not divisible by 32.
- **Output**: A C source file named `fd_reedsol_encode_{n}.c` with the generated encoding function.
- **Functions Called**:
    - [`firedancer/src/ballet/reedsol/generate_encode.cprint`](<#cprint>)
