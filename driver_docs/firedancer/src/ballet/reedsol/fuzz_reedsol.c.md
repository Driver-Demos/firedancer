Fuzz testing for Reed-Solomon encoding and decoding with error detection and recovery.

# Purpose
The code is a fuzz testing suite for a Reed-Solomon error correction implementation. It is designed to test the robustness and correctness of the Reed-Solomon encoding and decoding processes. The code includes two main functions: [`LLVMFuzzerInitialize`](<#llvmfuzzerinitialize>) and [`LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`](<#llvmfuzzertestoneinput>). The [`LLVMFuzzerInitialize`](<#llvmfuzzerinitialize>) function sets up the environment for the fuzzer by configuring logging and initializing necessary resources. The [`LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`](<#llvmfuzzertestoneinput>) function is the core of the fuzz testing, where it takes input data, interprets it as a test case for the Reed-Solomon algorithm, and performs encoding and decoding operations to verify the integrity and error detection capabilities of the implementation.

The code defines a structure `reedsol_test_t` to represent test cases, which include parameters such as shred size, data shred count, parity shred count, and indices for erased and corrupted shreds. The function [`LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`](<#llvmfuzzertestoneinput>) uses these parameters to simulate various scenarios of data corruption and recovery. It initializes the Reed-Solomon encoder and decoder, processes the data shreds, and checks if the recovery process can correctly handle erased and corrupted data. The code also includes mechanisms to ensure that any discrepancies or failures in the recovery process are detected, using assertions and traps to handle unexpected outcomes. This fuzz testing suite is intended to be used with a fuzzer like LLVM's libFuzzer to automatically generate and test a wide range of input scenarios.

# Functions

---
### LLVMFuzzerInitialize<!-- {{#callable:LLVMFuzzerInitialize}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/ballet/reedsol/fuzz_reedsol.c#L12>)

Initializes the fuzzer environment by setting environment variables, booting the system, registering an exit function, and setting the log level.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: A pointer to the argument count, typically from the command line.
    - `argv`: A pointer to the argument vector, typically from the command line.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Set the environment variable `FD_LOG_BACKTRACE` to `0` to disable backtraces in logs.
    - Call `fd_boot` with `argc` and `argv` to initialize the system.
    - Register `fd_halt` to be called on program exit using `atexit`.
    - Set the core log level to `3` using `fd_log_level_core_set`, which will cause the program to crash on warning logs.
    - Return `0` to indicate successful initialization.
- **Output**: Returns `0` to indicate successful initialization.

### LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput<!-- {{#callable:LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/ballet/reedsol/fuzz_reedsol.c#L36>)

Tests the integrity of Reed-Solomon encoding and decoding by simulating data corruption and recovery.
- **Inputs**:
    - `data`: A pointer to the input data, expected to be a `reedsol_test_t` structure.
    - `size`: The size of the input data in bytes.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Check if the input size is less than the size of `reedsol_test_t`; if so, return -1.
    - Cast the input data to a `reedsol_test_t` structure.
    - Initialize a random number generator.
    - Allocate memory for Reed-Solomon operations.
    - Calculate the size of shreds and the number of data, parity, and erased shreds based on the input test structure.
    - Check if the input size is sufficient for the calculated number of data shreds; if not, return -1.
    - Initialize Reed-Solomon encoding and add data and parity shreds.
    - Use reservoir sampling to randomly select shreds to erase and initialize Reed-Solomon recovery.
    - Verify the number of erased shreds matches the expected count; if not, trigger a trap.
    - Finalize the recovery process and check for errors; if errors are found, trigger a trap.
    - Simulate corruption of a single shred and verify that the corruption is detected.
    - Restore the original state of the corrupted shred.
    - Clean up the random number generator and return 0.
- **Output**: Returns 0 on successful execution, or -1 if the input size is insufficient.
- **Functions Called**:
    - [`fd_reedsol_encode_init`](<fd_reedsol.h.md#fd_reedsol_encode_init>)
