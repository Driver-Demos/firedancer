Auto-generated C code for encoding data and parity shreds using Reed-Solomon algorithm.

# Purpose
The code defines a function [`fd_reedsol_private_encode_64`](<#fd_reedsol_private_encode_64>), which is part of an implementation for encoding data using Reed-Solomon error correction. This function is designed to generate parity shreds from a set of data shreds. The function takes parameters that specify the size of each shred, pointers to the data shreds, the count of data shreds, pointers to the parity shreds, and the count of parity shreds. The function uses Galois Field arithmetic to process the data shreds and produce the required parity shreds, which are used for error detection and correction in data transmission or storage.

The function is structured to handle up to 64 data shreds and uses a series of switch-case statements to determine the number of data shreds to process. It uses macros like `FD_REEDSOL_GENERATE_IFFT` and `FD_REEDSOL_GENERATE_FFT` to perform the necessary mathematical transformations. The function also includes logic to handle cases where the number of parity shreds required exceeds the initial set of parity shreds generated, by producing additional parity shreds as needed. The function is marked with `FD_FN_UNSANITIZED`, indicating that it may not include certain safety checks, and it is part of a larger library, as suggested by the inclusion of the header file `fd_reedsol_ppt.h`.

Generates parity shreds from data shreds using Reed-Solomon encoding.
- **Inputs**:
    - `shred_sz`: The size of each shred in bytes.
    - `data_shred`: A pointer to an array of pointers, each pointing to a data shred.
    - `data_shred_cnt`: The number of data shreds.
    - `parity_shred`: A pointer to an array of pointers, each pointing to a parity shred.
    - `parity_shred_cnt`: The number of parity shreds to generate.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Initialize `shred_pos` to 0 and iterate while `shred_pos` is less than `shred_sz`.
    - Load data shreds into `gf_t` variables using [`gf_ldu`](<fd_reedsol_arith_none.h.md#gf_ldu>) for the first 32 data shreds and initialize the rest to zero.
    - Use a switch statement to load additional data shreds based on `data_shred_cnt`.
    - Define macros `ALL_VARS` and `ALL_VARS_REF` to reference all `gf_t` variables.
    - Use a switch statement to call specific functions or macros based on `data_shred_cnt` to generate parity shreds.
    - Calculate `total_shreds` as the sum of `data_shred_cnt` and `parity_shred_cnt`.
    - Store generated parity shreds into `parity_shred` using [`gf_stu`](<fd_reedsol_arith_none.h.md#gf_stu>) and reset the corresponding `gf_t` variables to zero.
    - Calculate `parity_produced` and `parity_remaining` to determine if more parity shreds are needed.
    - If more parity shreds are needed, generate additional parity shreds using `FD_REEDSOL_GENERATE_FFT` and store them.
    - Adjust `shred_pos` by `GF_WIDTH` and clamp it to `shred_sz-32` if necessary.
- **Output**: No direct output is returned; the function modifies the contents of `parity_shred` to store the generated parity shreds.
