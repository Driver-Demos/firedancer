Generates C code for Reed-Solomon erasure recovery functions with variable parameters.

# Purpose
The code is a Python script that generates C source files for Reed-Solomon error correction functions. The primary function, [`make_recover_var`](<#make_recover_var>), creates a C file for a specific number of shreds (`n`) and a maximum number of shreds (`max_shreds`). The generated C function, `fd_reedsol_private_recover_var_{n}`, is responsible for recovering data from a set of shreds, which are parts of data that can be used to reconstruct the original data even if some parts are missing or corrupted. The function uses Reed-Solomon error correction techniques, including inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) and fast Fourier transform (FFT), to regenerate missing data and verify the integrity of the recovered data.

The script uses a helper function [`cprint`](<#cprint>) to manage indentation and formatting of the generated C code. It handles the logic for loading shreds, checking for erased data, and performing mathematical operations on the data using Galois Field arithmetic. The script generates multiple C files for different values of `n`, specifically for 16, 32, 64, 128, and 256 shreds, each with a maximum of 134 shreds. The generated C functions include error checking to ensure that the data recovery process is successful and that no corruption is detected in the regenerated data.
# Global Variables

---
### indent
- **Type**: ``int``
- **Description**: The `indent` variable is an integer that represents the current level of indentation for formatted output. It is used to control the number of spaces to prepend to a string when printing.
- **Use**: Used in the `cprint` function to adjust the indentation level based on the presence of '{' and '}' characters in the input string.


# Functions

---
### cprint<!-- {{#callable:firedancer/src/ballet/reedsol/generate_recover.cprint}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/ballet/reedsol/generate_recover.py#L2>)

Prints a string with indentation based on the presence of curly braces.
- **Inputs**:
    - `string`: The string to print, which may contain indentation markers ('{' or '}').
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Checks if the input `string` is empty or contains only whitespace; if true, prints a blank line and returns.
    - Decreases the global `indent` by 1 if the `string` contains a closing curly brace '}'.
    - Prints the `string` with indentation determined by the current value of `indent`.
    - Increases the global `indent` by 1 if the `string` contains an opening curly brace '{'.
- **Output**: Prints the formatted string to the file object `outf`.

### make\_recover\_var<!-- {{#callable:firedancer/src/ballet/reedsol/generate_recover.make_recover_var}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/ballet/reedsol/generate_recover.py#L14>)

Generates a C source file to implement a variable recovery function for Reed-Solomon error correction.
- **Inputs**:
    - `n`: The number of shreds to process.
    - `max_shreds`: The maximum number of shreds to handle.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Opens a file named `fd_reedsol_recover_{n}.c` for writing.
    - Writes C code to the file, including necessary headers and function definitions.
    - Defines a function `fd_reedsol_private_recover_var_{n}` with parameters for shred size, shred data, data shred count, parity shred count, and erased status.
    - Initializes arrays `_erased` and `pi` with size `n` and calculates `shred_cnt` as the sum of data and parity shred counts.
    - Iterates over `n` to determine which shreds to load based on the `erased` array and updates `_erased` and `loaded_cnt`.
    - Checks if `loaded_cnt` is less than `data_shred_cnt` and returns an error if true.
    - Generates a permutation index `pi` using `fd_reedsol_private_gen_pi_{n}`.
    - Initializes a variable `diff` to track differences in regenerated shreds.
    - Iterates over shred positions to load and process shreds, applying mathematical operations like IFFT and FFT.
    - Handles different cases for storing, comparing, and reloading shreds based on their erased status.
    - Checks for any corruption in the shreds and returns an error if detected.
    - Advances the shred position and adjusts it if necessary.
    - Returns success if all operations complete without errors.
- **Output**: A C source file implementing a function for Reed-Solomon error correction with variable recovery.
- **Functions Called**:
    - [`firedancer/src/ballet/reedsol/generate_recover.cprint`](<#cprint>)
