Auto-generated C code for encoding data and parity shreds using Reed-Solomon error correction.

# Purpose
The code defines a function [`fd_reedsol_private_encode_32`](<#fd_reedsol_private_encode_32>), which is part of an auto-generated file. This function is responsible for encoding data using Reed-Solomon error correction codes. It takes a set of data shreds and generates parity shreds, which are used for error detection and correction. The function operates on a specified number of data shreds and parity shreds, processing them in blocks of 32. It uses Galois Field arithmetic, as indicated by the use of `gf_t` types and functions like `gf_ldu` and `gf_stu`, to perform the necessary mathematical operations for encoding.

The function is designed to handle different numbers of data shreds, as indicated by the switch-case structures that adjust the processing based on the `data_shred_cnt`. It uses macros such as `FD_REEDSOL_GENERATE_IFFT` and `FD_REEDSOL_GENERATE_PPT` to perform specific encoding operations, which are likely defined elsewhere in the included header `fd_reedsol_ppt.h`. The function ensures that the correct number of parity shreds is produced and stored, even if the total number of shreds exceeds the initial block size of 32. The function is marked with `FD_FN_UNSANITIZED`, indicating that it may not include certain safety checks, and it is intended for internal use within a larger Reed-Solomon encoding library.

Encodes data shreds into parity shreds using Reed-Solomon error correction.
- **Inputs**:
    - `shred_sz`: The size of each shred in bytes.
    - `data_shred`: A pointer to an array of pointers, each pointing to a data shred.
    - `data_shred_cnt`: The number of data shreds.
    - `parity_shred`: A pointer to an array of pointers, each pointing to a parity shred.
    - `parity_shred_cnt`: The number of parity shreds to produce.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Initialize `shred_pos` to 0 and iterate while `shred_pos` is less than `shred_sz`.
    - Load data shreds into variables `in00` to `in15` and initialize `in16` to `in31` to zero.
    - Use a switch statement to load additional data shreds into `in16` to `in31` based on `data_shred_cnt`.
    - Use another switch statement to generate parity shreds using `FD_REEDSOL_GENERATE_IFFT` or `FD_REEDSOL_GENERATE_PPT` macros based on `data_shred_cnt`.
    - Store the generated parity shreds into `parity_shred` array, considering the number of parity shreds needed.
    - If more parity shreds are needed, generate additional parity shreds using `FD_REEDSOL_GENERATE_FFT` and store them.
    - Repeat the process if there are still remaining parity shreds to produce.
    - Adjust `shred_pos` to handle cases where `shred_sz` is not divisible by 32.
- **Output**: No direct output; modifies the `parity_shred` array to contain the generated parity shreds.
- **Functions Called**:
    - [`gf_ldu`](<fd_reedsol_arith_none.h.md#gf_ldu>)
    - [`gf_stu`](<fd_reedsol_arith_none.h.md#gf_stu>)
