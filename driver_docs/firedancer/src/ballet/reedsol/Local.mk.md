Makefile for building and testing Reed-Solomon encoding and recovery components in the firedancer codebase.

# Purpose
The Makefile content defines build instructions for the `fd_reedsol` module, which is part of a software project. It uses macros to add header files, assembly files, and object files to the build process. The `add-hdrs` macro includes the `fd_reedsol.h` header file. If the `FD_HAS_GFNI` flag is set, the `add-asms` macro adds the `fd_reedsol_gfni_32` assembly file. The `add-objs` macro adds several object files related to encoding and recovery functions, such as `fd_reedsol_encode_16` and `fd_reedsol_recover_256`. If the `FD_HAS_HOSTED` flag is set, the file also includes instructions to create unit and fuzz tests for the `fd_reedsol` module using the `make-unit-test` and `make-fuzz-test` macros.
