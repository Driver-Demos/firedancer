Test vectors for SHA-512 hash function, generated using OpenSSL on random text strings.

# Purpose
The code is a C source file that defines a set of test vectors for the SHA-512 hashing algorithm. It is not intended to be compiled directly as an executable but rather serves as a data source for testing the correctness of SHA-512 implementations. The file contains a structure `fd_sha512_test_vector_t` that holds a message, its size, and the corresponding SHA-512 hash. The test vectors are stored in a static array `fd_sha512_test_vector`, which includes various messages of different lengths and their precomputed SHA-512 hashes.

The test vectors were generated using the OpenSSL SHA-512 implementation on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 system. The file includes a large number of test cases, each with a unique message and its corresponding hash, allowing developers to verify the accuracy of their SHA-512 implementations against known correct outputs. The file also contains a commented-out section that describes the process used to generate the input test strings, although this part of the code is not active. The test vectors are terminated with a null entry to indicate the end of the list.
# Global Variables

---
### \_sz
- **Type**: `double`
- **Description**: The `_sz` variable is a global variable of type `double` initialized to `0.f`. It is used in a loop to generate test strings for OpenSSL by incrementing its value until it reaches 4096.
- **Use**: Used to control the size of generated test strings in a loop.


---
### fac
- **Type**: `double`
- **Description**: The `fac` variable is a global variable of type `double` that is initialized to the square root of the square root of 2. This value is approximately 1.189207115002721.
- **Use**: The `fac` variable is used to scale the size `_sz` in a loop that generates test strings for OpenSSL.


---
### fd\_sha512\_test\_vector
- **Type**: ``fd_sha512_test_vector_t const[]``
- **Description**: An array of `fd_sha512_test_vector_t` structures, each containing a message string, its length, and the corresponding SHA-512 hash. The array is used to store test vectors for verifying the SHA-512 hashing algorithm.
- **Use**: Used to store and provide test vectors for validating the SHA-512 hashing implementation.


# Data Structures

---
### fd\_sha512\_test\_vector
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `msg`: Pointer to a constant character array representing the message to hash.
    - `sz`: Unsigned long integer representing the size of the message.
    - `hash`: Array of 64 unsigned characters representing the SHA-512 hash of the message.
- **Description**: Defines a test vector for SHA-512 hashing, containing a message, its size, and the resulting hash.


---
### fd\_sha512\_test\_vector\_t
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - ``msg``: Pointer to a constant character string representing the message.
    - ``sz``: Unsigned long integer representing the size of the message.
    - ``hash``: Array of 64 unsigned characters representing the SHA-512 hash of the message.
- **Description**: The `fd_sha512_test_vector_t` structure is used to store test vectors for SHA-512 hashing. It contains a message, the size of the message, and the resulting SHA-512 hash. This structure is part of a test suite to verify the correctness of SHA-512 hash computations by comparing known inputs and their expected hash outputs.
