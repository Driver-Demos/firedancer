Autogenerated assembly code for SHA-512 hashing using AVX2 instructions, modified for API integration.

# Purpose
This assembly source code file is an implementation of the SHA-512 cryptographic hash function optimized for the x86_64 architecture using AVX2 instructions. The code is part of the OpenSSL project, a widely used open-source library for secure communications. The primary function defined in this file, `fd_sha512_core_avx2`, is responsible for performing the core operations of the SHA-512 algorithm, which involves processing blocks of data to produce a fixed-size hash value. The use of AVX2 instructions allows for efficient parallel processing, enhancing the performance of the hash computation on modern processors that support these instructions.

The file includes several key technical components, such as the use of AVX2 vector instructions (`vzeroupper`, `vmovdqu`, `vpaddq`, etc.) to handle data in 256-bit chunks, which is crucial for the performance optimization of the SHA-512 algorithm. The code also manages the stack and registers meticulously to ensure that the data is processed correctly and efficiently. The constants used in the SHA-512 algorithm, such as the initial hash values and round constants, are defined in the `.quad` directives at the end of the file, which are essential for the hash computation process.

Overall, this file is a specialized component of the OpenSSL library, focusing on providing a high-performance implementation of the SHA-512 hash function for systems with x86_64 architecture and AVX2 support. It is a critical part of cryptographic operations, ensuring data integrity and security in various applications that rely on hashing, such as digital signatures, password storage, and data verification.
# Global Variables

---
### fd\_sha512\_core\_avx2\_k
- **Type**: `array of 64-bit integers`
- **Description**: The `fd_sha512_core_avx2_k` variable is an array of 64-bit integers used as constants in the SHA-512 hashing algorithm. These constants are part of the algorithm's compression function and are derived from the fractional parts of the cube roots of the first 80 prime numbers.
- **Use**: This variable is used in the SHA-512 hashing process to perform bitwise operations and transformations on the input data.


# Subroutines

---
### fd\_sha512\_core\_avx2
The `fd_sha512_core_avx2` function performs the core SHA-512 hash computation using AVX2 instructions for optimized performance on x86_64 architectures.
- **Inputs**:
    - `%rdi`: Pointer to the SHA-512 state array.
    - `%rsi`: Pointer to the input data to be hashed.
    - `%rdx`: Length of the input data in bytes.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - The function begins by saving the current state of several registers onto the stack and adjusting the stack pointer for local storage.
    - It calculates the effective address for the input data and adjusts the stack pointer for alignment.
    - The function enters a loop where it processes the input data in blocks, using AVX2 instructions to perform parallel operations on multiple data elements.
    - Within the loop, it loads data into YMM registers, performs bitwise operations, and updates the SHA-512 state using a series of AVX2 instructions.
    - The loop continues until all input data blocks are processed, after which the function restores the saved register states and returns.
- **Output**: The function updates the SHA-512 state array pointed to by %rdi with the hash of the input data.
