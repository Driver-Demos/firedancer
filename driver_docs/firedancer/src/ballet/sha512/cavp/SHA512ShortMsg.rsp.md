Test vectors for SHA-512 short message hashing, configured for byte-oriented implementations.

# Purpose
This file contains test vectors for the SHA-512 cryptographic hash function, specifically for short messages. Each test vector consists of a message length (`Len`), a message in hexadecimal format (`Msg`), and the resulting message digest (`MD`) also in hexadecimal format. The file is used to verify the correctness of SHA-512 implementations by providing known inputs and their expected outputs. The test vectors are organized by increasing message length, starting from 0 bytes up to 1024 bytes, allowing developers to test the hash function's behavior across a range of input sizes. This file is relevant to the codebase as it provides a standardized set of test cases to ensure the integrity and reliability of the SHA-512 implementation.
# Content Summary
The provided content is a configuration file for testing the SHA-512 cryptographic hash function. The file is part of the CAVS (Cryptographic Algorithm Validation System) 11.0 suite and is specifically for "SHA-512 ShortMsg" tests. These tests are designed for byte-oriented implementations of the SHA-512 algorithm.

The file contains a series of test vectors, each consisting of three key components:

1. **Len**: This indicates the length of the message in bits. The lengths range from 0 to 1024 bits, increasing in increments of 8 bits.

2. **Msg**: This is the hexadecimal representation of the message to be hashed. The message length corresponds to the value specified in the "Len" field.

3. **MD**: This is the expected output of the SHA-512 hash function, given the input message. It is a 128-character hexadecimal string representing the 512-bit hash value.

Each test vector provides a specific message length, message content, and the expected hash output. These vectors are used to verify the correctness of SHA-512 implementations by comparing the computed hash against the expected "MD" value. This ensures that the implementation produces the correct hash for a variety of input lengths and contents.
