Test vectors for SHA-384 short message hashing, generated for byte-oriented implementations.

# Purpose
This file contains test vectors for the SHA-384 cryptographic hash function, which is part of the Secure Hash Algorithm family. Each test vector consists of a message of varying length, specified in bytes, and its corresponding message digest (MD), which is the output of the SHA-384 hash function. The file is structured to provide a series of test cases, where each case includes a `Len` field indicating the length of the message in bytes, a `Msg` field containing the hexadecimal representation of the message, and an `MD` field showing the resulting hash. These test vectors are used to verify the correctness of SHA-384 implementations by ensuring that the hash function produces the expected output for given inputs. This file is relevant to the codebase as it provides a standardized set of inputs and expected outputs for testing and validating the integrity and accuracy of SHA-384 implementations.
# Content Summary
The provided content is a configuration file for testing the SHA-384 cryptographic hash function. The file is structured to test the hash function with various input message lengths and corresponding message data. Each test case is defined by three key components:

1. **Len**: This specifies the length of the message in bits. The lengths range from 0 to 1024 bits, increasing in increments of 8 bits.

2. **Msg**: This is the hexadecimal representation of the message data that will be hashed. The message data varies in length according to the specified `Len`.

3. **MD**: This is the expected output of the SHA-384 hash function, given the input message. It is a 96-character hexadecimal string, representing the 384-bit hash value.

The file is used to verify the correctness of SHA-384 implementations by comparing the computed hash of each message against the expected hash (`MD`). The tests are configured for byte-oriented implementations, meaning the message data is processed in byte-sized chunks. The file is part of a test suite generated on March 15, 2011, for the CAVS 11.0 (Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Suite) to ensure compliance with cryptographic standards.
