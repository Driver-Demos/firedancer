APIs and data structures for SHA-512 and SHA-384 hashing, including memory management and batch processing.

# Purpose
The code is a C header file that provides an API for SHA-512 and SHA-384 hashing operations. It defines constants, data structures, and function prototypes necessary for performing cryptographic hash calculations using the SHA-512 and SHA-384 algorithms. The file includes definitions for memory alignment and footprint requirements, which are crucial for efficient memory management and performance optimization. The `fd_sha512_t` and `fd_sha384_t` types represent the state of a hash calculation, and the file provides functions to initialize, append data to, and finalize hash calculations. Additionally, it includes batch processing capabilities with different implementations based on available hardware acceleration (e.g., AVX, AVX-512).

The header file defines several macros and functions to facilitate the use of SHA-512 and SHA-384 hashing in applications. Functions such as [`fd_sha512_new`](<#fd_sha512_new>), [`fd_sha512_join`](<#fd_sha512_join>), [`fd_sha512_leave`](<#fd_sha512_leave>), and [`fd_sha512_delete`](<#fd_sha512_delete>) manage the lifecycle of a hash calculation state. The [`fd_sha512_init`](<#fd_sha512_init>), [`fd_sha512_append`](<#fd_sha512_append>), and [`fd_sha512_fini`](<#fd_sha512_fini>) functions are used to start, update, and complete a hash calculation, respectively. The file also provides batch processing functions that allow multiple hash calculations to be performed simultaneously, leveraging hardware acceleration when available. This header file is intended to be included in other C source files to provide hashing functionality.

    - `batch_cnt`: The number of messages to process, must be between 1 and `FD_SHA512_BATCH_MAX`. If less than 2, messages are processed individually.
    - `_batch_data`: Pointer to an array of message data pointers, each aligned to 32 bytes. Only the first `batch_cnt` entries are used.
    - `batch_sz`: Pointer to an array of message sizes, each aligned to 32 bytes. Only the first `batch_cnt` entries are used.
    - `_batch_hash`: Pointer to an array of hash output pointers, each aligned to 32 bytes. Only the first `batch_cnt` entries are used.

[View Source →](<../../../../../src/ballet/sha512/fd_sha512.h#L362>)

Processes a batch of messages using SHA-512 with AVX-512 acceleration.
- **Description**: Use this function to compute SHA-512 hashes for a batch of messages when AVX-512 support is available. It is optimized for processing batches of messages with a count of 5 or more. For smaller batches, it defaults to a different processing method. Ensure that the input data and hash buffers are properly aligned and sized according to the batch count. This function does not return a value but writes the computed hashes to the provided output buffers.
- **Inputs**:
    - `batch_cnt`: The number of messages in the batch. Must be between 1 and FD_SHA512_BATCH_MAX (inclusive). If less than 5, a different processing method is used.
    - `_batch_data`: Pointer to an array of message data pointers. Each message data pointer must be aligned to 64 bytes. The array must have at least 'batch_cnt' elements.
    - `batch_sz`: Pointer to an array of message sizes. Each size corresponds to a message in '_batch_data'. The array must have at least 'batch_cnt' elements.
    - `_batch_hash`: Pointer to an array of hash output buffers. Each buffer must be aligned to 64 bytes and have space for a 64-byte hash. The array must have at least 'batch_cnt' elements.
- **Output**: None
- **See Also**: [`fd_sha512_private_batch_avx512`](<fd_sha512_batch_avx512.c.md#fd_sha512_private_batch_avx512>)  (Implementation)
