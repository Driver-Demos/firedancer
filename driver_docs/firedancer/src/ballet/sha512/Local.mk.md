Makefile for building and testing SHA-512 and SHA-384 implementations with AVX and AVX512 support.

# Purpose
The Makefile content defines build and test instructions for components related to SHA-512 and SHA-384 cryptographic functions. It uses conditional logic to include additional assembly and object files if specific hardware capabilities, such as AVX or AVX512, are available. The `add-hdrs`, `add-objs`, and `add-asms` functions are used to manage header, object, and assembly files, respectively, for the `fd_ballet` module. The file also specifies unit tests for `test_sha512` and `test_sha384`, and includes conditional fuzz testing for these components if the `FD_HAS_HOSTED` environment is defined. This setup ensures that the build process is optimized for the available hardware and that the cryptographic functions are thoroughly tested.
