Defines constants for Solana transaction size and platform-specific memory alignment.

# Purpose
This C header file defines configuration constants and alignment macros for use in a software project. It specifies `FD_TPU_MTU`, which is the maximum size of a Solana transaction in serialized wire-protocol form, excluding network-level headers. The file also defines `FD_ALIGN`, which sets the default memory alignment based on the platform capabilities, such as AVX512, AVX, or the presence of 128-bit integers. The `FD_ALIGNED` macro is a shortcut for applying the compiler's aligned attribute using the default alignment. The file includes a placeholder section for future interoperability functionality, indicated by the commented-out `FD_PROTOTYPES_BEGIN` and `FD_PROTOTYPES_END` markers.
