APIs for SECP256r1 signature verification, including a function to verify signatures.

# Purpose
This C header file defines the interface for verifying SECP256r1 signatures. It includes necessary dependencies from `fd_ballet_base.h` and `fd_sha256.h` to support its functionality. The file defines two macros, `FD_SECP256R1_SUCCESS` and `FD_SECP256R1_FAILURE`, to indicate the result of the signature verification process. The primary function declared is [`fd_secp256r1_verify`](<#fd_secp256r1_verify>), which takes a message, its size, a signature, a public key, and a SHA-256 context as inputs to verify the signature. The use of `FD_PROTOTYPES_BEGIN` and `FD_PROTOTYPES_END` suggests a structured approach to function declarations within the file.

Verifies a SECP256r1 signature.
- **Description**: Use this function to verify a digital signature using the SECP256r1 elliptic curve. It requires the message, its size, the signature, the public key, and a SHA-256 context. Ensure that the signature and public key are correctly formatted and that the SHA-256 context is initialized. The function returns a success or failure code based on the validity of the signature.
- **Inputs**:
    - `msg`: Pointer to the message data to verify. The caller retains ownership and must ensure it is not null.
    - `msg_sz`: Size of the message in bytes. Must accurately represent the length of the message data.
    - `sig`: Pointer to a 64-byte array containing the signature. Must not be null and must be correctly formatted.
    - `public_key`: Pointer to a 33-byte array containing the public key. Must not be null and must be correctly formatted.
    - `sha`: Pointer to an initialized SHA-256 context. Must not be null and should be prepared for hashing operations.
- **Output**: Returns `FD_SECP256R1_SUCCESS` if the signature is valid, otherwise returns `FD_SECP256R1_FAILURE`.
- **See Also**: [`fd_secp256r1_verify`](<fd_secp256r1.c.md#fd_secp256r1_verify>)  (Implementation)
