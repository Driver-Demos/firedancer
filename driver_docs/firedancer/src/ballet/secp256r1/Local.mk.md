Makefile logic for building and testing secp256r1 with s2n-bignum dependency.

# Purpose
The `Makefile` content conditionally includes headers, object files, and unit tests for the `fd_secp256r1` module if the `FD_HAS_S2NBIGNUM` flag is defined. It uses `add-hdrs` to add the `fd_secp256r1.h` header and `add-objs` to add the `fd_secp256r1` and `fd_ballet` object files. It also defines and runs a unit test named `test_secp256r1` with dependencies on `fd_ballet` and `fd_util`. If the `FD_HAS_S2NBIGNUM` flag is not defined, it issues a warning that `secp256r1` is disabled due to the absence of `s2n-bignum`.
