Defines a static constant array for precomputed Secp256r1 elliptic curve base point multiples.

# Purpose
The code defines a `static const` array named `fd_secp256r1_base_point_table`, which stores precomputed multiples of the Secp256r1 elliptic curve base point. This array is used to optimize elliptic curve cryptography operations by speeding up point multiplication, which is important for high-performance cryptographic computations. The array is defined as a sequence of hexadecimal values, indicating that it is intended for data storage rather than executable logic. The `static` and `const` qualifiers ensure that the array is used only within a single translation unit and that its values remain constant. The code does not define any public APIs, functions, or structures, and it is likely part of a larger cryptographic library or application that uses the Secp256r1 curve.

### fd\_secp256r1\_base\_point\_table
- **Type**: ``ulong[]``
- **Description**: Represents a static constant array of unsigned long integers that defines the base point table for the secp256r1 elliptic curve. This table is used in cryptographic operations related to elliptic curve cryptography (ECC).
- **Use**: Used to store precomputed values for efficient elliptic curve operations on the secp256r1 curve.
