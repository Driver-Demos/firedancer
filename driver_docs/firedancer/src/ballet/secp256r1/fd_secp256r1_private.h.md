Defines data structures and constants for secp256r1 elliptic curve operations in Montgomery form.

# Purpose
This C header file defines data structures and constants for operations related to the secp256r1 elliptic curve, which is commonly used in cryptographic applications for signature verification. It includes type definitions for field elements and scalar field elements using `fd_uint256_t`, a 256-bit unsigned integer type. The file defines a structure `fd_secp256r1_point_t` to represent points on the elliptic curve in Jacobian coordinates, which are used for efficient computation. Several constants are defined, including `fd_secp256r1_const_zero`, `fd_secp256r1_const_p`, `fd_secp256r1_const_one_mont`, `fd_secp256r1_const_a_mont`, `fd_secp256r1_const_b_mont`, `fd_secp256r1_const_n`, and `fd_secp256r1_const_n_m1_half`, which are used for field element validation and curve equation parameters. The file also includes another source file, `fd_secp256r1_s2n.c`, which likely contains additional implementation details for secp256r1 operations.
