Software-based implementation of the Proof-of-History hashchain with functions for appending and mixing.

# Purpose
This C header file defines the interface for a software-based implementation of a Proof-of-History (PoH) hash chain. It includes the necessary header for SHA-256 operations, indicating that the PoH implementation relies on SHA-256 hashing. The file declares two functions: [`fd_poh_append`](<#fd_poh_append>), which performs a specified number of recursive hash operations on a given PoH state, and [`fd_poh_mixin`](<#fd_poh_mixin>), which integrates a 32-byte value into the PoH state. The header uses include guards to prevent multiple inclusions and ensure that the function prototypes are only defined once.

### fd\_poh\_append<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_poh_append}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/ballet/poh/fd_poh.h#L8>)

Performs recursive hash operations on a Proof-of-History state.
- **Description**: Use this function to perform a specified number of recursive hash operations on a Proof-of-History (PoH) state. The function updates the PoH state by applying the SHA-256 hash function `n` times. This function is useful in contexts where a PoH hashchain is required. Ensure that the `poh` parameter points to a valid 32-byte memory region before calling this function.
- **Inputs**:
    - `poh`: A pointer to a 32-byte memory region that stores the current PoH state. The caller must ensure this pointer is valid and points to a writable memory region.
    - `n`: The number of recursive hash operations to perform. Must be a non-negative integer. If `n` is zero, the function returns immediately without modifying the PoH state.
- **Output**: Returns a pointer to the updated PoH state, which is the same as the input `poh` pointer.
- **See Also**: [`fd_poh_append`](<fd_poh.c.md#fd_poh_append>)  (Implementation)

### fd\_poh\_mixin<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_poh_mixin}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/ballet/poh/fd_poh.h#L28>)

Mixes a 32-byte value into the current Proof-of-History state.
- **Description**: Use this function to incorporate a 32-byte mixin value into the existing Proof-of-History (PoH) state. This function is useful when you need to update the PoH state with additional data. Ensure that `poh` points to a valid 32-byte memory region representing the current PoH state before calling this function. The function modifies the PoH state in place and returns a pointer to the updated state.
- **Inputs**:
    - `poh`: A pointer to a 32-byte memory region that stores the current PoH state. Must not be null. The function updates this memory region with the new state.
    - `mixin`: A pointer to a 32-byte value to mix into the PoH state. Must not be null. The function reads this value to update the PoH state.
- **Output**: Returns a pointer to the updated PoH state.
- **See Also**: [`fd_poh_mixin`](<fd_poh.c.md#fd_poh_mixin>)  (Implementation)
