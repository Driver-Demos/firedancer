Makefile for adding headers, objects, and running unit tests for `fd_poh` in the `firedancer` codebase.

# Purpose
The Makefile content defines build and test instructions for a software project. It adds the header file `fd_poh.h` and object files `fd_poh` and `fd_ballet` to the build process. It also specifies a unit test named `test_poh`, which depends on `fd_ballet` and `fd_util`, and includes instructions to run this unit test.
