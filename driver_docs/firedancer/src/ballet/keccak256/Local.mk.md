Makefile for building and testing the Keccak256 implementation in the Firedancer codebase.

# Purpose
The `Makefile` content defines build and test instructions for the `fd_keccak256` component. It adds the header file `fd_keccak256.h` and object files `fd_keccak256` and `fd_ballet` to the build process. It specifies a unit test named `test_keccak256` that depends on `fd_ballet` and `fd_util`, and it includes a command to run this unit test. If the `FD_HAS_HOSTED` variable is defined, it also includes instructions to create a fuzz test named `fuzz_keccak256` with dependencies on `fd_ballet` and `fd_util`.
