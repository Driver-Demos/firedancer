Fuzz testing for the Keccak256 hash function using LLVM's libFuzzer.

# Purpose
The code is a fuzz testing module designed to test the `fd_keccak256` hashing function. It is intended to be used with LLVM's libFuzzer, a library for coverage-guided fuzz testing. The module includes the [`LLVMFuzzerInitialize`](<#llvmfuzzerinitialize>) function, which sets up the environment by disabling signal handlers, initializing the application with `fd_boot`, and setting a log level that causes the program to crash on warnings. The `atexit` function registers `fd_halt` to be called upon program termination, ensuring a clean shutdown.

The core functionality is in the [`LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`](<#llvmfuzzertestoneinput>) function, which takes a data buffer and its size as input. It hashes the input data using the `fd_keccak256` function in two different ways: first by initializing, appending, and finalizing a `fd_keccak256_t` structure, and second by using a direct hash function call. The results of both methods are compared to ensure they produce the same hash output. The `FD_FUZZ_MUST_BE_COVERED` macro is used to ensure that all code paths are exercised during fuzzing. This module is part of a larger system that requires the `FD_HAS_HOSTED` macro to be defined, indicating it is intended to run in a hosted environment.

# Functions

---
### LLVMFuzzerInitialize<!-- {{#callable:LLVMFuzzerInitialize}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/ballet/keccak256/fuzz_keccak256.c#L13>)

Initializes the fuzzer environment by setting environment variables, booting the system, registering an exit function, and setting the log level.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: A pointer to the argument count, typically from the command line.
    - `argv`: A pointer to the argument vector, typically from the command line.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Set the environment variable `FD_LOG_BACKTRACE` to `0` to disable backtraces in logs.
    - Call `fd_boot` with `argc` and `argv` to initialize the system.
    - Register `fd_halt` to be called on program exit using `atexit`.
    - Set the core log level to `3` using `fd_log_level_core_set`, which causes the program to crash on warning logs.
    - Return `0` to indicate successful initialization.
- **Output**: Returns `0` to indicate successful initialization.

### LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput<!-- {{#callable:LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/ballet/keccak256/fuzz_keccak256.c#L24>)

Processes input data by hashing it using the Keccak-256 algorithm and verifies the consistency of the hash results.
- **Inputs**:
    - `data`: A pointer to the input data to be hashed, represented as an array of unsigned characters.
    - `size`: The size of the input data in bytes, represented as an unsigned long integer.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Casts the input data to a constant character pointer `msg`.
    - Initializes two arrays `hash1` and `hash2` to store hash results, each aligned to 32 bytes.
    - Initializes a Keccak-256 hashing context `sha`.
    - Appends the input message `msg` to the hashing context `sha` and finalizes the hash into `hash1`.
    - Directly hashes the input data into `hash2` using a single function call.
    - Compares the two hash results `hash1` and `hash2` to ensure they are identical.
    - Executes `FD_FUZZ_MUST_BE_COVERED` to ensure code coverage requirements are met.
    - Returns 0 to indicate successful execution.
- **Output**: Returns 0 to indicate successful execution.
- **Functions Called**:
    - [`fd_keccak256_init`](<fd_keccak256.c.md#fd_keccak256_init>)
    - [`fd_keccak256_append`](<fd_keccak256.c.md#fd_keccak256_append>)
    - [`fd_keccak256_fini`](<fd_keccak256.c.md#fd_keccak256_fini>)
    - [`fd_keccak256_hash`](<fd_keccak256.c.md#fd_keccak256_hash>)
