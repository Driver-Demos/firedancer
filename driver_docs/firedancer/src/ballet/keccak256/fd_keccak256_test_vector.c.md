Defines test vectors for the Keccak256 hash function using precomputed hashes from OpenSSL.

# Purpose
The code defines a set of test vectors for the Keccak-256 hash function. It is not intended to be compiled directly but serves as a reference for verifying the correctness of Keccak-256 implementations. The test vectors were generated using the OpenSSL 1.1.1g implementation of Keccak-256 on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 system. Each test vector consists of a message, its size, and the corresponding 32-byte hash output.

The main component of the code is the `fd_keccak256_test_vector_t` structure, which holds the message (`msg`), the size of the message (`sz`), and the computed hash (`hash`). The code defines an array of these structures, `fd_keccak256_test_vector`, which contains multiple test cases with varying message lengths and their expected hash results. The array is terminated with a special entry where the message is `NULL`, indicating the end of the test vectors. The macro `_` is used to simplify the representation of hexadecimal values in the hash arrays.
