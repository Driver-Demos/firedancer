Implements the core function for the Keccak-256 hash algorithm with constants and transformation steps.

# Purpose
The code is a C header file that defines a private implementation of the Keccak-256 cryptographic hash function core. It includes the function [`fd_keccak256_core`](<#fd_keccak256_core>), which performs the core operations of the Keccak-256 algorithm on a given state. The function is implemented as a static inline function, indicating that it is intended for use within the same translation unit and is optimized for performance. The implementation follows the Keccak specification and includes the main steps of the algorithm: Theta, Rho, Pi, Chi, and Iota. These steps are executed in a loop for a fixed number of 24 rounds, using predefined constants for each step.

The file includes necessary constants such as `round_consts`, `rho_consts`, and `pi_consts`, which are used in the transformation steps. The use of macros like `NUM_ROUNDS` and `ROTATE` helps in managing the number of rounds and bit rotations, respectively. The header file is protected by include guards to prevent multiple inclusions, and it includes a reference to a base header file `fd_ballet_base.h`, suggesting that it is part of a larger library or framework. The file does not define public APIs or external interfaces, as it is intended for internal use within the library, focusing on the core cryptographic operations of the Keccak-256 algorithm.

[View Source →](<../../../../../src/ballet/keccak256/fd_keccak256_private.h#L6>)

Performs the core Keccak-256 permutation on a given state array.
- **Inputs**:
    - `state`: A pointer to an array of 25 unsigned long integers representing the state to be permuted.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Defines constants for the 24 rounds of the Keccak permutation, including `round_consts`, `rho_consts`, and `pi_consts`.
    - Initializes temporary variables `b` and `t` for intermediate calculations.
    - Iterates over 24 rounds, performing the following steps in each round:
    - Theta step: Computes parity of columns and updates the state based on these parities.
    - Rho and Pi steps: Rotates and permutes the state using predefined constants.
    - Chi step: Applies a non-linear transformation to the state.
    - Iota step: XORs the first element of the state with a round constant.
- **Output**: The function modifies the input `state` array in place, applying the Keccak-256 permutation.
