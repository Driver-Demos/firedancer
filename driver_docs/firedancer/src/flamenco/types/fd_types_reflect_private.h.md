Defines a map API for looking up types by name in the Firedancer codebase.

# Purpose
This C header file defines a map API for looking up types by name. It includes the necessary header `fd_types_reflect.h` and sets up a map with specific configurations using preprocessor directives. The map is defined with a logarithmic slot count of 9, and it uses `fd_types_vt_t` as the map type and `fd_types_vt_key_t` as the key type. The key comparison is done by checking the length and content of the name using `memcmp`, and a custom hash function is used for key hashing. The file includes a template implementation from `fd_map.c` and declares an external map `fd_types_map` for type lookup.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `fd_types_reflect.h`
- `../../util/tmpl/fd_map.c`


# Global Variables

---
### fd\_types\_map
- **Type**: ``fd_types_vt_t` array`
- **Description**: An array named `fd_types_map` is declared as an external variable, which is used to store type information for lookup by name. The size of the array is determined by the macro `FD_TYPES_MAP_LG_SLOT_CNT`, which is set to 9, resulting in an array size of 512 (2^9).
- **Use**: Used to map and retrieve type information based on a name key.
