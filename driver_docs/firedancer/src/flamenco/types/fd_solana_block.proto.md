Protobuf definitions for Solana's ConfirmedBlock transaction status, integrated with Firedancer using nanopb.

# Purpose
The file defines Protobuf messages for the Solana blockchain's transaction status RPC APIs, specifically for the `ConfirmedBlock` package. These definitions are used to store and retrieve transaction metadata, which is not essential for consensus but is valuable for debugging and analyzing transaction execution side effects. The file uses nanopb, a lightweight C/C++ Protobuf code generator, to create efficient bindings suitable for embedded systems. The Protobuf messages include structures for transactions, instructions, token balances, rewards, and transaction status metadata, providing a comprehensive schema for capturing detailed transaction information. This metadata is stored in a blockstore column family by the Solana Labs validator and can be used by the test_runtime program to verify the accuracy of Firedancer's replay results.
# Content Summary
This file contains Protobuf definitions for the "ConfirmedBlock" data structure, which is part of the transaction status RPC APIs used by Solana Labs. The data format is not used for consensus but is useful for debugging as it provides information about the side effects of transaction execution. The file has been modified to integrate with Firedancer using nanopb, a lightweight C/C++ Protobuf code generator.

The file defines several Protobuf messages related to transactions and their statuses. Key messages include:

1. **MessageHeader**: Contains fields for the number of required signatures and the number of readonly signed and unsigned accounts.

2. **Instruction**: Represents a transaction instruction with fields for the program ID index, accounts, and data.

3. **MessageAddressTableLookup**: Contains fields for account keys and indexes for writable and readonly accounts.

4. **Message**: Includes a header, account keys, recent blockhash, instructions, versioning information, and address table lookups.

5. **Transaction**: Comprises signatures and a message.

6. **ConfirmedTransaction**: Contains a transaction and its status metadata.

7. **InnerInstruction** and **InnerInstructions**: Represent inner instructions within a transaction, including stack height information.

8. **TransactionError**: Captures any errors associated with a transaction.

9. **UiTokenAmount** and **TokenBalance**: Provide details on token amounts and balances, including account index, mint, owner, and program ID.

10. **Reward**: Describes rewards with fields for public key, lamports, post-balance, reward type, and commission.

11. **ReturnData**: Contains program ID and data for return values.

12. **TransactionStatusMeta**: Provides comprehensive metadata about a transaction, including errors, fees, balances, inner instructions, log messages, token balances, rewards, loaded addresses, return data, and compute units consumed.

The file uses nanopb annotations to optimize for embedded systems, specifying array size bounds and custom memory allocators. The Protobuf definitions are used to store transaction metadata in a blockstore column family, which can be accessed by the test_runtime program to verify Firedancer's replay results. The file also includes instructions for building and regenerating the code using a Makefile.
