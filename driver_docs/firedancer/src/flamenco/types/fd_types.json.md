Defines runtime types and structures for the Firedancer codebase, including Solana-related data types.

# Purpose
The JSON file defines a set of data structures and types used in a software codebase, specifically related to the Solana blockchain. It includes definitions for various data types such as `struct`, `enum`, and `opaque`, which are used to represent complex data structures and their fields. The file specifies the namespace as `fd` and the name as `fd_runtime_types`, indicating its role in defining runtime types for the application. The `extra_header` section lists additional header files to include, which are necessary for the implementation of these types. The `entries` array contains detailed definitions of each data structure, including their names, types, fields, and any associated metadata such as comments or references to source code lines. This file is crucial for the codebase as it provides a centralized definition of data types, ensuring consistency and facilitating the integration of various components within the Solana ecosystem.
# Content Summary
The provided JSON file defines a metadata configuration for a software codebase, specifically related to the Solana blockchain. This configuration file outlines various data structures and types used within the system, which are essential for developers working with the Solana codebase. The file is organized into several key components:

1. **Namespace and Headers**: The file begins by specifying a namespace "fd" and includes additional header files necessary for the definitions, such as `fd_bincode.h`, `fd_utf8.h`, and `fd_types_custom.h`.

2. **Entries**: The core of the file is a list of entries, each representing a data structure or type. These entries are defined with attributes such as `name`, `type`, and `fields`. The types include `struct`, `enum`, and `opaque`, among others. Each entry may also include additional metadata like `walktype`, `size`, `agave`, and comments linking to specific lines in the Solana GitHub repository for reference.

3. **Data Structures**: The entries define various data structures used in Solana, such as:
   - **Opaque Types**: These include `hash`, `pubkey`, and `signature`, which are defined with specific sizes and associated types from the Solana ecosystem.
   - **Structs**: These are complex data types with multiple fields, such as `feature`, `fee_calculator`, `slot_pair`, `inflation`, `rent`, and many others. Each struct has fields with specified types, and some have additional attributes like `archival` or `global`.
   - **Enums**: These define a set of named values, such as `reward_type`, `cluster_type`, and `vote_instruction`, which are used to represent different states or actions within the system.

4. **Comments and References**: Many entries include comments with URLs pointing to the specific lines in the Solana GitHub repository where the corresponding code or documentation can be found. This provides developers with direct references to the source material for further understanding.

5. **Special Attributes**: Some entries have special attributes like `packed`, `normalizer`, `validator`, and `zerocopy`, which indicate specific handling or processing requirements for those data structures.

Overall, this configuration file serves as a comprehensive reference for developers working with the Solana blockchain, providing detailed definitions of the data structures and types used throughout the system. It is crucial for ensuring consistency and understanding of the data models within the codebase.
