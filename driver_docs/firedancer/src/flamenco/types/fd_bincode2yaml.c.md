Converts a bincode blob to YAML using specified type and file inputs.

# Purpose
The code is an executable C program designed to convert binary-encoded data (bincode) into YAML format. It includes several header files, such as `fd_types_yaml.h` and `fd_types_reflect.h`, which suggest that it uses specific types and reflection capabilities for handling the conversion process. The program begins by defining a [`usage`](<#usage>) function that provides instructions on how to use the executable, specifying command-line options like `--type` and `--file` to indicate the type of data and the path to the bincode file, respectively.

The [`main`](<#main>) function initializes the program environment and processes command-line arguments to extract necessary parameters. It sets up a workspace and a scratch memory allocator to manage memory during the conversion process. The program reads the specified bincode file into memory, decodes it using a context structure, and then converts the data into YAML format using functions from the `fd_flamenco_yaml` library. The conversion relies on type-specific virtual functions obtained through `fd_types_vt_by_name`, which handle the decoding and walking of the data structure to produce the YAML output. The program concludes by cleaning up allocated resources and halting execution.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `../types/fd_types_yaml.h`
- `../types/fd_types_reflect.h`
- `stdio.h`
- `stdlib.h`
- `sys/stat.h`
- `fcntl.h`
- `unistd.h`


# Functions

---
### usage<!-- {{#callable:usage}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/flamenco/types/fd_bincode2yaml.c#L10>)

Prints usage instructions for the `fd_bincode2yaml` command to the standard error stream.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Calls `fprintf` to print a multi-line string to `stderr` that includes usage instructions and options for the `fd_bincode2yaml` command.
- **Output**: No return value; outputs usage instructions to `stderr`.

Converts a bincode blob to YAML format by processing command-line arguments, allocating memory, reading a file, and decoding its contents.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments.
    - `argv`: An array of command-line argument strings.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Calls `fd_boot` to initialize the environment with command-line arguments.
    - Iterates over command-line arguments to check for the `--help` flag and displays usage information if found.
    - Extracts command-line options for page size, page count, scratch memory size, type, and file path using `fd_env_strip_cmdline_cstr` and `fd_env_strip_cmdline_ulong`.
    - Checks if `type` or `file` is NULL and displays usage information if true.
    - Converts the page size string to an unsigned long using `fd_cstr_to_shmem_page_sz`.
    - Creates an anonymous workspace with `fd_wksp_new_anonymous` and checks for successful allocation.
    - Allocates scratch memory using `fd_wksp_alloc_laddr` and attaches it with `fd_scratch_attach`.
    - Opens the specified file, retrieves its size using `fstat`, and reads its contents into a scratch buffer.
    - Initializes a decode context with the file data and creates a YAML object using `fd_flamenco_yaml_init`.
    - Looks up the function pointer for the specified type using `fd_types_vt_by_name` and checks for success.
    - Calculates the total size needed for decoding using `decode_footprint` and allocates memory for the decoded data.
    - Decodes the file data and walks through the decoded structure to convert it to YAML format.
    - Cleans up by popping and detaching the scratch memory and halts the program with `fd_halt`.
- **Output**: Returns 0 on successful execution or an error code if a failure occurs during decoding.
- **Functions Called**:
    - [`usage`](<#usage>)
