Automatically generated nanopb constant definitions for Solana block-related structures and bindings.

# Purpose
This code is an automatically generated C source file that defines constant bindings for Protocol Buffers (protobuf) messages using the nanopb library. The file includes the header `fd_solana_block.pb.h`, which contains the protobuf definitions for various Solana blockchain-related structures. The code uses the `PB_BIND` macro to bind C structures to their corresponding protobuf message types, such as `fd_solblock_MessageHeader`, `fd_solblock_Instruction`, and `fd_solblock_Transaction`. These bindings facilitate the serialization and deserialization of data between C structures and protobuf messages.

The file includes a version check to ensure compatibility with the nanopb generator version used to create it. If the `PB_PROTO_HEADER_VERSION` does not match the expected version, it triggers a compilation error, prompting regeneration with the correct version. Additionally, the code contains a static assertion to verify that the `double` data type is 8 bytes, which is necessary for platforms where `double` might be equivalent to `float`. This file is part of a larger system that interacts with Solana blockchain data, providing a structured way to handle complex data types in a C environment.
