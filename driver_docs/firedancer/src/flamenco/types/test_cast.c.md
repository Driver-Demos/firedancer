Tests the `fd_rust_cast_double_to_ulong` function with various double values.

# Purpose
This code is a C program that tests the behavior of the function `fd_rust_cast_double_to_ulong`, which converts `double` values to `unsigned long` integers. The program initializes several `double` variables, including positive and negative infinity, NaN (Not a Number), a negative value, a positive value, and the maximum possible `unsigned long` value. It then uses the `FD_TEST` macro to verify that the conversion function produces the expected `unsigned long` results for each `double` value. The program begins by calling `fd_boot` to initialize the environment and ends with `fd_halt` to clean up before exiting.

Initializes the environment, tests the `fd_rust_cast_double_to_ulong` function with various double values, and then halts the program.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments.
    - `argv`: An array of strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Calls `fd_boot` to initialize the environment with command-line arguments.
    - Defines several double precision floating-point variables representing special values like infinity, negative infinity, NaN, negative, positive, and maximum unsigned long values.
    - Uses `FD_TEST` to verify that `fd_rust_cast_double_to_ulong` correctly casts these double values to unsigned long values, checking against expected results.
    - Calls `fd_halt` to terminate the program.
    - Returns 0 to indicate successful execution.
- **Output**: Returns 0 to indicate successful execution.
