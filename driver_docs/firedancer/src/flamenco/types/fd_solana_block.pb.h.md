Defines data structures and constants for Solana confirmed block transactions using nanopb.

# Purpose
The code is a C header file generated by the nanopb tool, which is used for encoding and decoding Protocol Buffers in C. This file defines data structures and constants for handling Solana blockchain transactions and their associated metadata. The file includes definitions for various structures such as `fd_solblock_MessageHeader`, `fd_solblock_Instruction`, `fd_solblock_Message`, `fd_solblock_Transaction`, and `fd_solblock_ConfirmedTransaction`, among others. These structures represent different components of a Solana transaction, including message headers, instructions, transaction details, and status metadata.

The header file also defines an enumeration `fd_solblock_RewardType` to categorize different types of rewards in the Solana blockchain, such as fees, rent, staking, and voting. Additionally, it provides initializer macros for the defined structures, which help in setting default or zero values for the fields. The file includes field tags and encoding specifications for manual encoding and decoding of Protocol Buffers messages. This header is intended to be included in other C source files that need to process or interact with Solana blockchain transaction data using nanopb.
