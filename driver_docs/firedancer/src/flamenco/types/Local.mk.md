Makefile for building and testing components in the `firedancer` codebase with conditional compilation.

# Purpose
The content is a Makefile script used to automate the build process for a software project. It defines a series of conditional and procedural instructions to compile and test various components of the project. The `ifdef FD_HAS_INT128` directive checks for the presence of a specific feature (`FD_HAS_INT128`) and, if available, includes headers and object files necessary for building and testing. The script uses `$(call make-unit-test,...)` to define unit tests for different modules, such as `test_types_meta` and `test_types_yaml`, and `$(call run-unit-test,...)` to execute these tests. Additionally, the script includes instructions to create a library (`fd_flamenco_test`) and, conditionally, a binary (`fd_bincode2yaml`) and a fuzz test (`fuzz_types_decode`) if `FD_HAS_HOSTED` is defined. The script also references Protobuf definitions for "ConfirmedBlock" by adding the object file `fd_solana_block.pb` to the build process.
