Makefile for building, cleaning, and generating stubs in the Flamenco types directory.

# Purpose
This Makefile defines several targets for building and cleaning a project. The `PYTHON` variable specifies the Python interpreter to use, defaulting to `python3`. The `all` target runs a make command in the parent directory, while the `clean` target runs a make clean command in the parent directory to remove build artifacts. The `stubs` target generates stub files by executing Python scripts `gen_stubs.py` and `gen_fuzz.py` with specified input files, using the Python interpreter defined by the `PYTHON` variable. The `.PHONY` directive marks the `all`, `clean`, and `stubs` targets as phony, indicating they do not correspond to actual files.
