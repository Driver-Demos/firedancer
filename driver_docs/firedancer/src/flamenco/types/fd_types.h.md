Defines data structures and functions for Solana blockchain account management, fee calculation, epoch scheduling, and voting state management.

# Purpose
The header file defines a collection of data structures and functions related to the Solana blockchain, focusing on account management, fee calculation, epoch scheduling, and voting state management. It includes definitions for various data structures such as accounts, fees, rent, inflation, and voting mechanisms, which are used to represent and manage different aspects of the blockchain's state and operations. The file provides public APIs and external interfaces for creating, encoding, decoding, and manipulating these structures, intended for use by other parts of the codebase or external programs. It also includes functions and enumerations for managing the `fd_rent_state_t` type, representing different rent states like uninitialized, rent-paying, and rent-exempt. The code uses both public and static inline functions, with `FD_FN_PURE` indicating that some functions are pure, ensuring predictable behavior. The file is auto-generated, and modifications should be made to the source JSON file (`fd_types.json`) to maintain consistency and correctness.

It must be called with a valid memory region that has been allocated for `fd_slot_hashes_t`. The function initializes the structure and decodes the data into it. It is important to ensure that the provided context (`ctx`) is properly initialized before calling this function. If the memory region is insufficient for the expected data, the behavior is undefined.
- **Inputs**:
    - `mem`: A pointer to a memory region where the decoded `fd_slot_hashes_t` structure will be stored. This memory must be allocated by the caller and should be large enough to hold the structure.
    - `ctx`: A pointer to a `fd_bincode_decode_ctx_t` structure that contains the decoding context. This must not be null and should be properly initialized before use.
- **Output**: Returns a pointer to the decoded `fd_slot_hashes_t` structure. If the decoding fails, the behavior is undefined.

- **Inputs**:
    - `self`: A pointer to a `fd_nonce_state_t` structure. Must not be null. The function expects a valid instance to calculate its size.

[View Source →](<../../../../../src/flamenco/types/fd_types.h#L3864>)

Calculates the size of a transaction cost structure.
- **Description**: This function determines the size of the `fd_transaction_cost_t` structure, which includes a fixed size and additional size based on the inner structure's details. It must be called with a valid pointer to an initialized `fd_transaction_cost_t` structure. If the `discriminant` field of the structure is not valid, the function may not return the expected size.
- **Inputs**:
    - `self`: A pointer to a constant `fd_transaction_cost_t` structure. Must not be null. The structure must be properly initialized before calling this function.
- **Output**: Returns the size in bytes of the `fd_transaction_cost_t` structure, which may vary based on the inner structure's details.

Decodes the footprint of a transaction cost.
- **Description**: This function is used to decode the footprint of a transaction cost from a binary encoded format. It must be called with a valid `fd_bincode_decode_ctx_t` that has been properly initialized. The `total_sz` parameter is updated to reflect the size of the decoded footprint. If the decoding process encounters an overflow, it returns an error code. The function does not modify the input context beyond the footprint calculation.
- **Inputs**:
    - `ctx`: A pointer to a `fd_bincode_decode_ctx_t` structure. This must not be null and should point to a valid context that contains the binary data to decode.
    - `total_sz`: A pointer to an `ulong` that accumulates the total size of the decoded footprint. The caller retains ownership of this variable, and it must be initialized to a valid value before calling the function.
- **Output**: Returns an integer indicating the success or failure of the decoding operation. A return value of zero indicates success, while a negative value indicates an error, such as overflow.
