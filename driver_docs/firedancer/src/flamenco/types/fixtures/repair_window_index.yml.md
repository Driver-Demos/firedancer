Defines a repair window index with header details including signature, sender, recipient, and timestamp.

# Purpose
The metadata defines a `window_index` structure containing a `header` and additional fields. The `header` includes a `signature`, `sender`, `recipient`, `timestamp`, and `nonce`, which are likely used for message verification and tracking. The `slot` and `shred_index` fields provide additional identifiers for data organization or retrieval within a system.
