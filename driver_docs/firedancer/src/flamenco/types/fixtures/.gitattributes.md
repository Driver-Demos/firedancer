Configures Git to treat all files as binary in the specified directory.

# Purpose
The `* binary` entry in a configuration file is used to specify that certain files should be treated as binary files. This can affect how the system processes or handles these files, such as in version control systems where binary files are not subject to text-based diff operations.
