YAML configuration for a vote account with node public key, authorized withdrawer, and voting history.

# Purpose
The file is a configuration file that manages the state and operations of a node in a blockchain network. It contains several key components, including the `node_pubkey`, which identifies the node, and the `authorized_withdrawer`, which specifies the entity authorized to withdraw funds. The `commission` field indicates the commission rate for the node's operations. The `votes` section records the node's voting history, detailing the `latency`, `lockout` slots, and `confirmation_count` for each vote. The `root_slot` represents the last confirmed slot, while the `authorized_voters` and `prior_voters` sections manage voter authorization and history. The `epoch_credits` section tracks the credits earned by the node over different epochs, showing the progression of credits and their previous values. Finally, the `last_timestamp` provides the timestamp and slot of the last recorded event, ensuring synchronization with the network's timeline.
# Content Summary
This configuration file contains metadata related to a node in a blockchain network. The file includes several key components:

1. **Node Information**:
   - `node_pubkey`: This is the public key of the node, which is 'D91hS1rccFa5idPr9TpWmhPxfyJCtzHaet2juYzQNrPC'.
   - `authorized_withdrawer`: This is the public key authorized to withdraw funds, which is 'DAqvncuek4qKcC8xrHtXWgnC2XykYASmpLCJJ9iFeAoF'.
   - `commission`: The node's commission rate is set at 8%.

2. **Voting Details**:
   - `votes`: This section lists the votes cast by the node, each with a `latency` of 0 and a `lockout` structure that includes a `slot` number and a `confirmation_count`. The slots range from 254462400 to 254462436, with confirmation counts decreasing from 31 to 1.
   - `root_slot`: The root slot is set to 254462399.

3. **Authorized Voters**:
   - `authorized_voters`: This section specifies the authorized voter for epoch 589, which is the same as the node's public key.

4. **Prior Voters**:
   - `prior_voters`: This section contains a buffer of prior voters, all with a public key of '11111111111111111111111111111111', and both `epoch_start` and `epoch_end` set to 0. The index (`idx`) is 31, and the buffer is marked as empty (`is_empty: true`).

5. **Epoch Credits**:
   - `epoch_credits`: This section records the credits earned by the node over various epochs, from epoch 526 to 589. Each entry includes the `epoch` number, `credits` earned, and `prev_credits` from the previous epoch.

6. **Last Timestamp**:
   - `last_timestamp`: This records the last known slot and timestamp, with the slot being 254462436 and the timestamp being 1710567087.

This file is crucial for tracking the node's voting activity, commission settings, and credit accumulation over time within the blockchain network.
