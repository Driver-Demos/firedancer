Specifies patterns for Git to ignore files with ".actual." in their names.

# Purpose
The pattern `*.actual.*` is used in a configuration file to specify a file matching rule. It matches any file with the substring `.actual.` in its name, regardless of the file's prefix or suffix. This pattern is often used in tools that process or ignore files, such as version control systems or build tools, to identify files that contain actual output data or results.
