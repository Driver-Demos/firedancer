YAML configuration for a vote account with details on public keys, votes, and epoch credits.

# Purpose
This file is a configuration file that manages the settings and state of a node in a blockchain network. It contains several key components, including the `node_pubkey`, which identifies the node, and the `authorized_withdrawer`, which specifies the entity authorized to withdraw funds. The `commission` field indicates the commission rate for the node. The file also includes voting-related data, such as `votes` and `authorized_voters`, which manage the node's participation in consensus processes. The `prior_voters` section records historical voting data, while `epoch_credits` tracks the node's credit accumulation over different epochs. The `last_timestamp` provides the last recorded time and slot, ensuring synchronization with the network.
# Content Summary
This configuration file contains metadata related to a node in a blockchain network. The key components of the file are as follows:

1. **Node Public Key**: The `node_pubkey` field specifies the public key of the node, which is '7QsvAtWRqjhQRjd7BzGVT29x5KrUFqZA1T8pVrHGdxeP'.

2. **Authorized Withdrawer**: The `authorized_withdrawer` field indicates the public key authorized to withdraw funds, which is '9frWPHZmLVAkZBUZveujokPi2sQRTucnztr3vnCveZBQ'.

3. **Commission**: The `commission` field is set to 0, indicating no commission is charged.

4. **Votes**: The `votes` section contains information about the node's voting behavior. It includes a `latency` of 0 and a `lockout` with a `slot` of 1 and a `confirmation_count` of 1.

5. **Root Slot**: The `root_slot` is set to 0, which may indicate the starting point for certain operations or calculations.

6. **Authorized Voters**: The `authorized_voters` section lists the current authorized voter with the public key '9frWPHZmLVAkZBUZveujokPi2sQRTucnztr3vnCveZBQ' for `epoch` 0.

7. **Prior Voters**: The `prior_voters` section contains a buffer (`buf`) of previous voters, all with the same placeholder public key '11111111111111111111111111111111', and `epoch_start` and `epoch_end` both set to 0. The `idx` is 31, and `is_empty` is true, indicating no valid prior voters are recorded.

8. **Epoch Credits**: The `epoch_credits` section records credits for `epoch` 0, with `credits` set to 1 and `prev_credits` set to 0.

9. **Last Timestamp**: The `last_timestamp` section provides the last recorded `slot` as 1 and a `timestamp` of 1690200075, which represents a specific point in time.

This file is crucial for managing node operations, voting, and authorization within the blockchain network.
