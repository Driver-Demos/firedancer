Auto-generated file defining a list of 151 data types with associated operations and metadata.

# Purpose
The code is an auto-generated C source file that defines a list of data types and their associated operations. It includes a list of structures, each representing a specific data type with attributes such as `name`, `name_len`, `align`, and function pointers for operations like `new_`, `decode`, `size`, `walk`, `decode_footprint`, and `encode`. These operations are likely used for creating, decoding, sizing, traversing, and encoding the data types. The file includes headers `fd_types.h`, `fd_types_custom.h`, and `fd_types_reflect_private.h`, which suggests that it is part of a larger system that manages these data types.

The file defines an array `fd_types_vt_list` containing entries for various data types, such as `fd_hash`, `fd_pubkey`, `fd_signature`, and many others, each with specific alignment and operation functions. The array is terminated with a `NULL` entry, indicating the end of the list. The variable `fd_types_vt_list_cnt` holds the count of entries in the list, excluding the terminating `NULL`. This file is intended to be used as part of a system that requires dynamic handling of these data types, possibly for serialization, deserialization, or other data management tasks.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `fd_types.h`
- `fd_types_custom.h`
- `fd_types_reflect_private.h`


# Global Variables

---
### fd\_types\_vt\_list\_cnt
- **Type**: ``ulong``
- **Description**: Stores the count of elements in the `fd_types_vt_list` array. The value is set to 151, indicating the number of entries in the list.
- **Use**: Used to track the number of entries in the `fd_types_vt_list` array.


---
### fd\_types\_vt\_list
- **Type**: ``fd_types_vt_t const[]``
- **Description**: An array of constant structures, each representing a type with associated metadata and function pointers. Each element in the array contains information such as the name, alignment, and function pointers for operations like creation, decoding, size calculation, walking, footprint decoding, and encoding.
- **Use**: Used to store and manage metadata and operations for various types in the system.
