Tool for creating Solana genesis blobs to bootstrap a Solana ledger with configurable options.

# Purpose
The `fd_genesis_create.h` file is a C header file designed for creating Solana genesis blobs, which are used to bootstrap a Solana ledger. It defines a structure, `fd_genesis_options_t`, that holds various configuration options necessary for genesis creation, such as public keys, creation time, balances, and other parameters related to the Solana network setup. The file includes a function prototype for [`fd_genesis_create`](<#fd_genesis_create>), which generates a genesis blob in a specified memory region based on the provided options. This function returns the number of bytes used in the output memory region on success or 0 on failure, and it is intended for development purposes only, not for production use. The header also includes necessary dependencies and defines a macro guard to prevent multiple inclusions.

# Data Structures

---
### fd\_genesis\_options
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `identity_pubkey`: Holds the public key for identity.
    - `faucet_pubkey`: Holds the public key for the faucet.
    - `stake_pubkey`: Holds the public key for staking.
    - `vote_pubkey`: Holds the public key for voting.
    - `creation_time`: Specifies the creation time in Unix time format.
    - `faucet_balance`: Specifies the balance of the faucet in lamports.
    - `vote_account_stake`: Specifies the stake of the vote account in lamports.
    - `hashes_per_tick`: Specifies the number of hashes per tick, with 0 indicating unset.
    - `ticks_per_slot`: Specifies the number of ticks per slot.
    - `target_tick_duration_micros`: Specifies the target duration of a tick in microseconds.
    - `fund_initial_accounts`: Specifies the number of initial accounts to fund.
    - `fund_initial_amount_lamports`: Specifies the initial amount of lamports to fund accounts with.
    - `warmup_epochs`: Specifies the number of warmup epochs.
    - `features`: Points to an externally owned feature map for feature accounts in the genesis blob.
- **Description**: Defines configuration options for creating a Solana genesis blob, which is used to bootstrap a Solana ledger. It includes public keys for identity, faucet, stake, and vote, as well as parameters for creation time, balances, tick settings, and feature accounts.

# Function Declarations (Public API)

---
### fd\_genesis\_create<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_genesis_create}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/flamenco/genesis/fd_genesis_create.h#L41>)

Creates a Solana genesis blob in the specified buffer.
- **Description**: Use this function to create a Solana genesis blob, which is necessary to bootstrap a Solana ledger. The function writes the genesis blob into the specified memory region. Ensure that the caller is attached to an `fd_scratch` with enough memory to buffer intermediate data. This function is intended for development purposes only and is not safe for production use. It returns the number of bytes written to the buffer on success, or 0 if an error occurs, logging the reason for the failure.
- **Inputs**:
    - `buf`: A pointer to the memory region where the genesis blob will be written. The caller must ensure that this buffer is large enough to hold the output.
    - `bufsz`: The size of the buffer in bytes. It must be large enough to accommodate the genesis blob.
    - `options`: A pointer to a `fd_genesis_options_t` structure containing the configuration parameters for the genesis creation. This must not be null.
- **Output**: Returns the number of bytes written to the buffer on success, or 0 on failure.
- **See Also**: [`fd_genesis_create`](<fd_genesis_create.c.md#fd_genesis_create>)  (Implementation)
