Stub implementation of `fd_solcap_writer` for non-hosted targets with basic memory operations.

# Purpose
The code provides a stub implementation of the `fd_solcap_writer` for non-hosted targets. It defines a structure `fd_solcap_writer` with a single member `dummy` of type `uchar`. The code includes several functions that operate on this structure, such as [`fd_solcap_writer_align`](<#fd_solcap_writer_align>), [`fd_solcap_writer_footprint`](<#fd_solcap_writer_footprint>), [`fd_solcap_writer_new`](<#fd_solcap_writer_new>), [`fd_solcap_writer_delete`](<#fd_solcap_writer_delete>), [`fd_solcap_writer_init`](<#fd_solcap_writer_init>), and [`fd_solcap_writer_flush`](<#fd_solcap_writer_flush>). These functions return basic information about the structure or perform simple operations, often returning the input parameters directly. The functions `fd_solcap_writer_set_slot`, `fd_solcap_write_account`, `fd_solcap_write_account2`, `fd_solcap_write_bank_preimage`, `fd_solcap_write_bank_preimage2`, and `fd_solcap_write_transaction2` are defined with parameters marked as unused, and they return default values, such as `0` for integer functions.

The primary purpose of this code is to provide a placeholder or minimal implementation of the `fd_solcap_writer` functionality for environments where a full implementation is not required or possible. This is useful for testing or compiling in environments that do not support the full capabilities of the `fd_solcap_writer`. The functions are designed to be non-operational, serving as placeholders that allow the code to compile and link without providing actual functionality. This approach is common in cross-platform development where certain features are only available on specific platforms.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `fd_solcap_writer.h`


# Global Variables

---
### fd\_solcap\_writer\_set\_slot
- **Type**: `function`
- **Description**: Sets the slot for the `fd_solcap_writer_t` writer. The function is a stub and does not perform any operations.
- **Use**: Used to set the slot for a writer, but currently does nothing as it is a stub implementation.


---
### fd\_solcap\_write\_account
- **Type**: `function`
- **Description**: Implements a stub function for writing account data using a `fd_solcap_writer_t` writer. The function takes parameters for the writer, key, account metadata, data, and data size, but does not use them and always returns 0.
- **Use**: Used as a placeholder for writing account data in non-hosted targets.


---
### fd\_solcap\_write\_account2
- **Type**: `function`
- **Description**: Implements a stub function for writing account data using a writer, account table, account metadata, and data buffer. The function is part of a stub implementation for non-hosted targets and always returns 0.
- **Use**: Used to simulate writing account data in non-hosted environments.


---
### fd\_solcap\_write\_bank\_preimage
- **Type**: `function`
- **Description**: Processes the writing of a bank preimage using a writer and several hash parameters. The function is a stub implementation and always returns 0.
- **Use**: Used to handle the writing of bank preimage data in a non-hosted target environment.


---
### fd\_solcap\_write\_bank\_preimage2
- **Type**: `function`
- **Description**: Implements a stub function for writing a bank preimage using a `fd_solcap_writer_t` writer and a `fd_solcap_BankPreimage` preimage. The function currently returns 0, indicating a placeholder implementation.
- **Use**: Used as a placeholder for writing a bank preimage in non-hosted targets.


---
### fd\_solcap\_write\_transaction2
- **Type**: `function`
- **Description**: Implements a stub function for writing a transaction using a `fd_solcap_writer_t` writer and a `fd_solcap_Transaction` transaction. The function currently returns 0, indicating a placeholder implementation.
- **Use**: Used as a placeholder for writing transactions in non-hosted targets.


# Data Structures

---
### fd\_solcap\_writer
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - ``dummy``: A placeholder member of type `uchar`.
- **Description**: The `fd_solcap_writer` struct is a stub implementation intended for non-hosted targets. It contains a single member, `dummy`, which serves as a placeholder. This struct is used in various functions related to writing account and bank preimage data, but the actual implementation details are not provided in this stub.


# Functions

---
### fd\_solcap\_writer\_align<!-- {{#callable:fd_solcap_writer_align}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/flamenco/capture/fd_solcap_writer_stub.c#L10>)

Returns the alignment requirement of the `fd_solcap_writer_t` structure.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Use the `alignof` operator to get the alignment requirement of the `fd_solcap_writer_t` structure.
    - Return the alignment value.
- **Output**: The alignment requirement of the `fd_solcap_writer_t` structure as an `ulong`.


---
### fd\_solcap\_writer\_footprint<!-- {{#callable:fd_solcap_writer_footprint}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/flamenco/capture/fd_solcap_writer_stub.c#L15>)

Calculates the memory footprint of the `fd_solcap_writer_t` structure.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Return the size of the `fd_solcap_writer_t` structure using the `sizeof` operator.
- **Output**: Returns the size of the `fd_solcap_writer_t` structure as an unsigned long integer.


---
### fd\_solcap\_writer\_new<!-- {{#callable:fd_solcap_writer_new}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/flamenco/capture/fd_solcap_writer_stub.c#L20>)

Returns the memory pointer passed to it as an argument.
- **Inputs**:
    - `mem`: A pointer to memory that the function will return.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - The function takes a single argument, `mem`, which is a pointer to memory.
    - It returns the `mem` pointer without any modification.
- **Output**: A pointer to the memory location passed as the input argument `mem`.


---
### fd\_solcap\_writer\_delete<!-- {{#callable:fd_solcap_writer_delete}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/flamenco/capture/fd_solcap_writer_stub.c#L25>)

Returns the input pointer without modification.
- **Inputs**:
    - ``mem``: A pointer to an `fd_solcap_writer_t` structure that is to be deleted.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - The function takes a pointer `mem` as input.
    - It returns the same pointer `mem` without any modification.
- **Output**: A pointer to `fd_solcap_writer_t`, which is the same as the input `mem`.


---
### fd\_solcap\_writer\_init<!-- {{#callable:fd_solcap_writer_init}} -->

Initializes a `fd_solcap_writer_t` object by returning the provided `writer` pointer.
- **Inputs**:
    - `writer`: A pointer to a `fd_solcap_writer_t` object that will be initialized.
    - `stream`: A pointer to a stream, marked as unused with `FD_PARAM_UNUSED`, indicating it is not used in this function.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - The function takes two parameters: `writer` and `stream`, but only `writer` is used.
    - The function returns the `writer` pointer without any modification.
- **Output**: Returns the same `fd_solcap_writer_t` pointer that is passed as the `writer` argument.


---
### fd\_solcap\_writer\_flush<!-- {{#callable:fd_solcap_writer_flush}} -->
