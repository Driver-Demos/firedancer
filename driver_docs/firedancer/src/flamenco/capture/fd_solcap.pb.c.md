Automatically generated nanopb constant definitions for various fd_solcap data structures.

# Purpose
This C source code file contains automatically generated constant definitions for Protocol Buffers (protobuf) using the nanopb library. It includes the header file `fd_solcap.pb.h` and checks the `PB_PROTO_HEADER_VERSION` to ensure compatibility with version 40, prompting regeneration if there is a mismatch. The file uses the `PB_BIND` macro to bind several protobuf message types, such as `fd_solcap_FileMeta`, `fd_solcap_BankPreimage`, and others, to their corresponding C structures with automatic field handling. This setup facilitates the serialization and deserialization of these message types in applications that use nanopb for lightweight protobuf handling.
