Makefile rules for building binaries and objects related to Solcap in the Firedancer project.

# Purpose
This Makefile script manages the build process for a software project. It uses conditional logic to include headers and compile object files based on the presence of `FD_HAS_INT128` and `FD_HAS_HOSTED` flags. If both flags are set, it compiles the `fd_solcap_writer`, `fd_solcap_reader`, and `fd_solcap.pb` objects and creates binaries `fd_solcap_diff`, `fd_solcap_import`, and `fd_solcap_yaml` with dependencies on `fd_flamenco`, `fd_ballet`, and `fd_util`. If `FD_HAS_HOSTED` is not set, it compiles a stub version of `fd_solcap_writer`.
