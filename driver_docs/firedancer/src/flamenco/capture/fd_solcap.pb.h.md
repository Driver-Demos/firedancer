Defines nanopb message structures and field specifications for Solana capture data, including metadata, bank preimages, account details, and transaction information.

# Purpose
The code is a C header file generated by the nanopb tool, which is used for encoding and decoding Protocol Buffers in C. This file defines several data structures and associated metadata for capturing and processing blockchain-related data, specifically for the Solana blockchain. The file includes definitions for various structures such as `fd_solcap_FileMeta`, `fd_solcap_BankPreimage`, `fd_solcap_AccountTableMeta`, `fd_solcap_AccountMeta`, `fd_solcap_StakeRewardEpoch`, `fd_solcap_StakeRewardEvent`, `fd_solcap_VoteAccountPayout`, `fd_solcap_StakeAccountPayout`, and `fd_solcap_Transaction`. These structures are used to represent metadata, bank preimages, account tables, account metadata, stake reward epochs, stake reward events, vote account payouts, stake account payouts, and transactions.

Each structure is associated with specific fields that capture relevant data points, such as slot numbers, hashes, lamport balances, and transaction signatures. The file also includes initializer macros for these structures, providing default and zero-initialized values. Additionally, the file defines field tags for manual encoding and decoding, ensuring compatibility with nanopb's encoding specifications. The header file is intended to be included in other C source files that require access to these data structures and their associated functionalities. It also includes version checks to ensure compatibility with the nanopb generator version used to create the file.
