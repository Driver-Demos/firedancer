Defines protocol buffer messages for capturing Solana blockchain data, including metadata, bank preimages, account details, and transaction information.

# Purpose
This file defines a protocol buffer schema using `proto3` syntax for capturing and storing metadata related to Solana blockchain data. It includes several message definitions that describe different components of the blockchain data capture. The `FileMeta` message contains metadata about the capture file, such as the first slot number and the total number of slots. The `BankPreimage` message provides details about the bank hash pre-image for a given slot, including hashes for the bank, previous bank, account delta, and Proof-of-History. The `AccountTableMeta` and `AccountMeta` messages describe metadata related to account tables and individual accounts, including slot numbers, offsets, and account data. Additionally, the file defines messages for handling stake reward events, such as `StakeRewardEpoch`, `StakeRewardEvent`, `VoteAccountPayout`, and `StakeAccountPayout`, which capture details about reward distribution and account updates. The `Transaction` message records transaction-specific data, including transaction signatures, error codes, and resource usage. This schema is used to serialize and deserialize data for efficient storage and retrieval in the context of Solana blockchain operations.
# Content Summary
The provided content is a Protocol Buffers (proto3) file that defines the structure of messages used in the Solana capture package. This file is used to serialize and deserialize data related to Solana blockchain operations. It imports "nanopb.proto" and specifies options for nanopb, a small code-size Protocol Buffers implementation in C.

Key components of the file include:

1. **FileMeta Message**: This message contains metadata for a capture file, including the first slot number (`first_slot`), the total number of slots (`slot_cnt`), and a magic number for the main block type (`main_block_magic`).

2. **BankPreimage Message**: This message holds the pre-image of the bank hash for a given slot. It includes fields for the slot number, bank hash, previous bank hash, account delta hash, Proof-of-History (PoH) hash, signature count, account count, account table offset, and a checksum for all accounts.

3. **AccountTableMeta Message**: This message provides metadata for an accounts table, including the slot number, chunk offset to the first entry, and the number of records in the accounts table.

4. **AccountMeta Message**: This message describes account metadata, including lamports, slot number, owner, executable status, data offset, and data size.

5. **StakeRewardEpoch Message**: This message is emitted at the start of stake reward events and includes the payout epoch, reward epoch, inflation lamports, and reward points.

6. **StakeRewardEvent Message**: This message is generated during inflation reward calculations and includes the stake account address, vote account address, commission, vote rewards, stake rewards, and new credits observed.

7. **VoteAccountPayout Message**: This message is emitted when stake rewards for a vote account are paid out, detailing the account address, update slot, new lamport balance, and lamport balance change.

8. **StakeAccountPayout Message**: This message is similar to VoteAccountPayout but for stake accounts, including additional fields for credits observed and delegation stake changes.

9. **Transaction Message**: This message captures transaction details, including transaction signature, slot, error codes, custom errors, compute units used, and instruction error details.

Each message is structured with fields that have specific data types and constraints, such as fixed lengths and maximum sizes, to ensure efficient data handling and integrity.
