Defines the sBPF interpreter jump table for opcode execution and handling invalid opcodes.

# Purpose
The code defines a jump table for an sBPF (Solana Berkeley Packet Filter) interpreter. The jump table is an array where each index corresponds to an opcode that can be executed by the interpreter. The table is structured to handle different versions of sBPF, as indicated by the `FD_SBPF_VERSION_COUNT` dimension. Each opcode is associated with a label that the interpreter can jump to for execution. If an opcode is invalid, the code branches to a `sigill` label, which likely handles illegal instruction exceptions.

The code uses macros to define how opcodes are mapped to their corresponding labels. The `ALL_ILLEGAL` macro marks opcodes as illegal, while the `ALL_OPCODE` macro maps valid opcodes to their respective interpreter labels. The `CONDITIONAL` macro is used to handle opcodes that depend on specific conditions or features, such as enabling or disabling certain instructions based on configuration flags. This setup allows the interpreter to efficiently handle a wide range of opcodes and adapt to different sBPF versions and configurations.

### interp\_jump\_table
- **Type**: `static void const * const`
- **Description**: Holds the sBPF interpreter jump table, which is an array where each index is an opcode that can be jumped to for execution. Invalid opcodes branch to the `sigill` label.
- **Use**: Used to map opcodes to their corresponding execution labels in the sBPF interpreter.
