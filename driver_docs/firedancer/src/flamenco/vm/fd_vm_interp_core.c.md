SBPF virtual machine interpreter core for executing instructions, handling faults, and managing VM state.

# Purpose
The code is the core of a virtual machine (VM) interpreter for the SBPF (Solana Berkeley Packet Filter) instruction set. It is designed to execute SBPF bytecode by interpreting instructions and managing the VM state. The interpreter processes instructions in a loop, updating the program counter (`pc`), instruction count (`ic`), and compute units (`cu`) as it executes each instruction. The interpreter supports a wide range of SBPF operations, including arithmetic, logical, memory access, and control flow instructions. It also handles system calls and manages a shadow stack for function calls and returns.

The interpreter uses a jump table to efficiently dispatch instructions based on their opcodes. It includes mechanisms for handling various faults, such as illegal instructions, memory access violations, and division errors. The code also includes macros to mimic Rust's wrapping shift operations and to manage the execution of instructions and system calls. The interpreter is designed to be robust against errors, with specific labels and error handling for different types of faults. The code is structured to allow for precise tracking of the VM's execution state, which is packed back into the VM structure upon halting.

# Global Variables

---
### sbpf\_version
- **Type**: `ulong`
- **Description**: `sbpf_version` is a global variable of type `ulong` that stores the SBPF version of the virtual machine (VM).
- **Use**: Used to determine the appropriate jump table for instruction execution based on the SBPF version.


---
### pc
- **Type**: `ulong`
- **Description**: `pc` is a global variable of type `ulong` that represents the program counter in the virtual machine (VM) interpreter core. It is initialized with the value of `vm->pc`, which is the current program counter of the VM.
- **Use**: Tracks the current position in the instruction sequence being executed by the VM.


---
### ic
- **Type**: `ulong`
- **Description**: `ic` is a global variable of type `ulong` that represents the instruction count in the VM SBPF interpreter core.
- **Use**: Tracks the number of instructions executed by the VM.


---
### cu
- **Type**: `ulong`
- **Description**: `cu` is a global variable of type `ulong` that represents the compute units available for the virtual machine (VM) execution.
- **Use**: Tracks the remaining compute units during the execution of the VM to ensure it does not exceed its compute budget.


---
### frame\_cnt
- **Type**: `ulong`
- **Description**: `frame_cnt` is a global variable of type `ulong` that stores the current count of frames in the virtual machine (VM) execution context.
- **Use**: Tracks the number of frames in the VM's execution stack.


---
### version\_interp\_jump\_table
- **Type**: ``void const * const * const``
- **Description**: Points to a specific jump table for the SBPF interpreter based on the current SBPF version. This variable is a constant pointer to a constant pointer to a constant, ensuring that the jump table it references cannot be modified during execution.
- **Use**: Used to direct execution flow to the correct instruction handler based on the opcode in the SBPF interpreter.


---
### instr
- **Type**: `ulong`
- **Description**: `instr` is a global variable of type `ulong` that holds the first word of the current instruction being executed by the virtual machine interpreter.
- **Use**: Used to parse and execute the current instruction in the interpreter loop.


---
### opcode
- **Type**: `ulong`
- **Description**: Represents the operation code of an instruction in the VM SBPF interpreter core. The operation code is extracted from the instruction word and determines the specific operation to execute.
- **Use**: Used to index into the `version_interp_jump_table` to jump to the appropriate code for executing the instruction.


---
### dst
- **Type**: ``ulong``
- **Description**: Represents the destination register index for an instruction in the VM SBPF interpreter core. It is used to determine which register will receive the result of an operation.
- **Use**: Used to store the index of the destination register for the current instruction being executed.


---
### src
- **Type**: `ulong`
- **Description**: `src` is a global variable of type `ulong` (unsigned long).
- **Use**: It is used to store the source register index during instruction execution in the SBPF interpreter.


---
### offset
- **Type**: `ulong`
- **Description**: `offset` is a 16-bit value that is always sign-extended to fit into a 64-bit unsigned long integer (`ulong`).
- **Use**: Used to calculate the program counter (`pc`) offset for branching instructions in the SBPF interpreter.


---
### imm
- **Type**: ``uint``
- **Description**: Represents an immediate value extracted from an instruction word in the VM interpreter. It is a 32-bit unsigned integer.
- **Use**: Used to store immediate values during instruction execution in the VM interpreter.


---
### reg\_dst
- **Type**: `ulong`
- **Description**: Holds the value of the destination register for the current instruction being executed in the SBPF interpreter.
- **Use**: Used to store the value of the destination register fetched from the instruction during execution.


---
### reg\_src
- **Type**: `ulong`
- **Description**: `reg_src` is a global variable of type `ulong` that holds the value of a source register in the VM SBPF interpreter core.
- **Use**: Used to store the value of a source register for instruction execution in the interpreter.


---
### ret
- **Type**: `ulong[1]`
- **Description**: An array of unsigned long integers with a single element.
- **Use**: Stores the result of a syscall to prevent accidental modification of other registers.


---
### cu\_req
- **Type**: `ulong`
- **Description**: `cu_req` is a variable of type `ulong` that stores the current compute units (`cu`) from the virtual machine (`vm`).
- **Use**: It is used to determine the minimum compute units available by comparing it with another compute unit value.


---
### pc0
- **Type**: `ulong`
- **Description**: `pc0` is a global variable of type `ulong` that stores the initial program counter value at the start of a linear segment of instructions in the VM SBPF interpreter core.
- **Use**: Tracks the start of a linear segment to calculate the number of instructions processed for compute unit billing.


---
### ic\_correction
- **Type**: `ulong`
- **Description**: `ic_correction` is a global variable of type `ulong` initialized to 0UL. It is used to accumulate the number of extra text words processed by multiword instructions in a segment of the program.
- **Use**: Used to adjust the instruction count for billing compute units in the VM interpreter.
