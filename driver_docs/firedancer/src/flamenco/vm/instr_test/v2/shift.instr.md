Tests for left shift operations on 32-bit and 64-bit registers with immediate and register values.

# Purpose
The content is a set of test cases for verifying the behavior of left shift operations in a software system, specifically focusing on 32-bit and 64-bit registers. Each line represents a test case with a specific operation code (`op`), destination register (`dst`), source register (`src`), offset (`off`), initial register values, and immediate values (`imm`). The results of the operations are indicated by the expected values in the destination registers, with comments providing additional context such as "zero" or "truncate upper". The test cases are categorized by the type of left shift operation: immediate value shifts (`lsh32 reg, imm` and `lsh64 reg, imm`) and register value shifts (`lsh32 reg, reg`). The `ok` and `vfy` tags indicate whether the operation is expected to succeed or if it is a verification case for invalid operations, such as using invalid source or destination registers. This file is crucial for ensuring the correctness and reliability of the left shift operations within the system.
# Content Summary
The provided content is a configuration file that describes a series of operations for a hypothetical assembly-like language. The operations involve left shift (lsh) instructions applied to registers, with variations in operand types and sizes. The file is organized into three main sections, each corresponding to a different type of left shift operation: `lsh32 reg, imm`, `lsh32 reg, reg`, and `lsh64 reg, imm`.

1. **lsh32 reg, imm**: This section describes 32-bit left shift operations where a register is shifted by an immediate value. Each line specifies an operation with the following details:
   - `op=64`: The operation code for a 32-bit left shift with an immediate value.
   - `dst`: The destination register where the result is stored.
   - `src`: The source register from which the value is taken.
   - `off`: An offset value, which seems to be a part of the operation's metadata.
   - `rX`: The initial value of the source register.
   - `imm`: The immediate value by which the source register is shifted.
   - `ok` or `vfy`: Indicates whether the operation is valid (`ok`) or requires verification (`vfy`).
   - The result of the operation is shown after the colon.

2. **lsh32 reg, reg**: This section describes 32-bit left shift operations where a register is shifted by the value in another register. The format is similar to the previous section, with the following differences:
   - `op=6c`: The operation code for a 32-bit left shift with a register value.
   - `rX`: Represents the value of the source register used for the shift.
   - The result of the operation is calculated based on the value in the source register.

3. **lsh64 reg, imm**: This section describes 64-bit left shift operations where a register is shifted by an immediate value. The format is similar to the `lsh32 reg, imm` section, with the following differences:
   - `op=67`: The operation code for a 64-bit left shift with an immediate value.
   - The result of the operation is a 64-bit value, reflecting the larger data size.

Each section includes operations that are marked as `ok` for valid operations and `vfy` for operations that require verification, possibly due to invalid source or destination registers or other constraints. The file provides a comprehensive list of operations, detailing the initial and resulting values for each operation, which is crucial for developers to understand the behavior and correctness of these operations in the context of the software.
