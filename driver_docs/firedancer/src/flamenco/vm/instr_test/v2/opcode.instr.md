Defines a set of opcodes with their corresponding operations and status for a virtual machine.

# Purpose
This file defines a set of operation codes (`op`) and their corresponding behaviors for a virtual machine or an instruction set simulator. Each line specifies an operation code, an immediate value (`imm`), and a status or action such as `vfy` (verify), `ok` (operation is valid), or `err` (error). The comments following each entry provide additional context about the operation, such as arithmetic operations (e.g., `add32`, `sub64`), logical operations (e.g., `or32`, `xor64`), and control flow operations (e.g., `jeq`, `jgt`). Some operations have been marked as removed or added, indicating changes in the instruction set, possibly due to updates or optimizations. This file is crucial for defining the behavior of the instruction set and ensuring that the virtual machine or simulator processes instructions correctly.
# Content Summary
The provided content is a configuration file that defines a set of operations, each identified by an opcode (`op`) and an immediate value (`imm`). The file specifies the status of each operation, which can be one of the following: `ok`, `vfy`, `vfyub`, or `err`. These statuses indicate whether the operation is valid (`ok`), requires verification (`vfy`), requires verification with a specific check (`vfyub`), or is erroneous (`err`).

Key details include:

1. **Opcode and Immediate Value**: Each operation is associated with an opcode (`op`) and an immediate value (`imm`). The opcode is a hexadecimal value that uniquely identifies the operation, while the immediate value is typically set to `0` unless specified otherwise.

2. **Operation Status**:
   - `ok`: The operation is valid and can be executed without restrictions.
   - `vfy`: The operation requires verification before execution.
   - `vfyub`: The operation requires verification with a specific check, such as `FD_CHECK_DIV`.
   - `err`: The operation is erroneous and should not be executed.

3. **Operation Descriptions**: Each operation is described with a comment indicating its function, such as arithmetic operations (`add32`, `sub64`), logical operations (`or32`, `xor64`), and control flow operations (`jeq`, `jgt`).

4. **SIMD-0173 and SIMD-0174**: Some operations have comments indicating they were added or removed due to specific changes, such as `SIMD-0173` and `SIMD-0174`. These comments provide context for modifications in the operation set.

5. **Error and Verification**: Certain operations, particularly those involving memory access or division, are marked as `err` or `vfy`, indicating potential issues or the need for additional checks.

This configuration file is crucial for developers working with the software codebase, as it defines the permissible operations and their statuses, guiding the implementation and execution of these operations within the system.
