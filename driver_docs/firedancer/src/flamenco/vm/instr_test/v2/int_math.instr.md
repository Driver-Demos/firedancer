Tests for 32-bit and 64-bit integer arithmetic and bitwise operations, including validation of invalid cases.

# Purpose
The content is a set of test cases for verifying the behavior of a virtual machine or an emulator that processes low-level operations. Each line represents a test case for a specific operation, such as addition (`add32`, `add64`), subtraction (`sub32`, `sub64`), multiplication (`mul32`, `mul64`), division (`udiv32`, `udiv64`, `sdiv32`, `sdiv64`), and remainder (`urem32`, `urem64`, `srem32`, `srem64`). The test cases include both immediate and register-based operations. Each test case specifies the operation code (`op`), destination register (`dst`), source register (`src`), offset (`off`), initial register values, immediate values, and the expected result. The comments indicate the expected outcome, such as overflow, underflow, or validation errors (`vfy`) for invalid operations. This file is crucial for ensuring the correctness and stability of the virtual machine's arithmetic and logical operations by providing a comprehensive set of scenarios to test against.
# Content Summary
The provided content is a detailed specification of various arithmetic and logical operations performed on registers within a software codebase. Each operation is represented by a line of metadata that includes the operation type, destination and source registers, offsets, initial register values, immediate values, and the resulting register values after the operation. The operations are categorized by their types, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and remainder operations, and are further divided into 32-bit and 64-bit operations.

Key technical details include:

1. **Operation Codes (op):** Each operation is identified by a unique hexadecimal code. For example, `op=04` represents an `add32 reg, imm` operation, while `op=0f` represents an `add64 reg, reg` operation.

2. **Registers and Immediate Values:** The operations involve destination (`dst`) and source (`src`) registers, with some operations also involving immediate values (`imm`). The initial values of the registers are specified, and the resulting values after the operation are provided.

3. **Offset Values:** Each operation includes an offset (`off`), which may be used for addressing or other purposes within the operation.

4. **Result and Status:** The result of each operation is indicated by the final value of the destination register. The status of the operation is marked as `ok` for successful operations, `vfy` for operations that require verification due to invalid source or destination registers, and `err` for operations that result in errors, such as divide by zero or overflow.

5. **Special Cases and Comments:** Some operations include comments indicating special cases, such as overflow, underflow, sign extension, and truncation of upper bits. These comments provide additional context for understanding the behavior of the operation.

6. **Invalid Operations:** Lines marked with `vfy` indicate operations with invalid source or destination registers, or other issues that require verification. These lines highlight potential errors or misconfigurations in the operation setup.

This metadata is crucial for developers working with the codebase to understand the behavior and outcomes of arithmetic and logical operations on registers, ensuring correct implementation and debugging of the software.
