Tests for jump instruction condition logic in a virtual machine using various scenarios and outcomes.

# Purpose
The code is a test suite designed to evaluate the condition logic in jump instructions within a virtual machine (VM). It uses a verification oracle, denoted as `vfy/ok/err`, to determine if the VM correctly evaluates various jump conditions. The test cases cover a range of jump instructions, including conditional jumps based on equality, inequality, greater than, less than, and bitwise operations. Each test case specifies an operation code (`op`), destination (`dst`), source (`src`), offset (`off`), and immediate value (`imm`), along with expected outcomes such as `vfy` (verification error), `ok` (successful execution), or `err` (execution error).

The test cases are organized by the type of jump instruction they are testing. For example, `jeq` tests jump if equal, `jgt` tests jump if greater than, and `jset` tests jump if a bitwise AND is not zero. Each instruction is tested with different combinations of register values and immediate values to ensure comprehensive coverage of possible execution paths. The tests also include scenarios that are expected to cause out-of-bounds errors or infinite loops, which are marked with specific offsets like `ffff` for spin loops and `aaaa` for out-of-bounds.

This file is not an executable but rather a collection of test cases intended to be run within a testing framework that can interpret the specified instructions and verify the VM's behavior. It does not define public APIs or external interfaces but serves as an internal tool for validating the correctness of the VM's jump instruction logic.
