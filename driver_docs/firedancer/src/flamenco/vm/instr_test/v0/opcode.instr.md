Defines a set of opcodes with their corresponding operations and status for a virtual machine.

# Purpose
This file defines a set of operation codes (`op`) and their corresponding immediate values (`imm`) for a virtual machine or an assembly-like language. Each operation code is associated with a status, such as `ok`, `vfy`, or `err`, which indicates whether the operation is valid, requires verification, or results in an error. The operations include arithmetic and logical instructions like `add`, `sub`, `mul`, `div`, `or`, `and`, `xor`, `mov`, and `neg`, as well as various conditional jumps (`jeq`, `jgt`, `jge`, `jlt`, `jle`, `jslt`, `jsle`). The file also includes instructions for data movement and manipulation, such as `lddw`, `stxw`, and `call`. This configuration is crucial for defining the behavior and validation of instructions executed by the virtual machine, ensuring that only supported operations are performed and identifying those that require further verification or are erroneous.
# Content Summary
The content provided is a configuration file that defines a set of operations, each identified by an opcode (`op`) and an immediate value (`imm`). The file specifies the status of each operation, which can be one of the following: `ok`, `vfy`, or `err`. These statuses indicate whether the operation is valid (`ok`), requires verification (`vfy`), or is erroneous (`err`).

Key details include:

1. **Operation Codes (op):** Each line begins with an operation code (`op`) in hexadecimal format, ranging from `00` to `ff`. This code uniquely identifies the operation.

2. **Immediate Values (imm):** Each operation has an associated immediate value (`imm`), which is typically `0` but can vary, as seen in some operations like `div32 reg, imm` and `mod32 reg, imm`.

3. **Status Indicators:**
   - `ok`: The operation is valid and can be executed. Examples include arithmetic operations like `add32`, `sub64`, and logical operations like `or32`, `xor64`.
   - `vfy`: The operation requires verification before execution. This status is common for many operations, indicating they need further checks.
   - `err`: The operation is erroneous and should not be executed. Examples include certain division operations like `div32 reg, reg` and memory operations like `ldxw reg, [reg+off]`.

4. **Operation Descriptions:** Comments following the status provide a brief description of the operation, such as `add32 reg, imm` for adding a 32-bit immediate value to a register.

5. **Categories of Operations:**
   - **Arithmetic Operations:** Include addition (`add`), subtraction (`sub`), multiplication (`mul`), division (`div`), and modulus (`mod`).
   - **Logical Operations:** Include bitwise operations like `or`, `and`, `xor`, and negation (`neg`).
   - **Shift Operations:** Include left shift (`lsh`), right shift (`rsh`), and arithmetic right shift (`arsh`).
   - **Comparison and Jump Operations:** Include operations like `jeq` (jump if equal), `jgt` (jump if greater than), and `jlt` (jump if less than).

6. **Memory Operations:** Some operations involve memory access, such as loading (`ldx`) and storing (`stx`) values at specific offsets. These operations often have an `err` status, indicating potential issues with memory access.

This configuration file is crucial for developers working with this codebase, as it outlines the permissible operations and their statuses, guiding the implementation and debugging of the software.
