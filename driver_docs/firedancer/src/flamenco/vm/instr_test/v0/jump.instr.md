Tests for jump instruction condition logic in a virtual machine using various scenarios and outcomes.

# Purpose
The code is a test suite designed to evaluate the condition logic in jump instructions within a virtual machine (VM). It uses a verification oracle, denoted as `vfy/ok/err`, to determine if the VM correctly evaluates various jump conditions. The test cases cover a range of jump instructions, including conditional jumps based on equality, inequality, greater than, less than, and bitwise operations. Each test case specifies an operation code (`op`), destination (`dst`), source (`src`), offset (`off`), and immediate value (`imm`), along with expected outcomes such as `vfy` (verification error), `ok` (successful execution), or `err` (execution error).

The test cases are organized by the type of jump instruction they are testing. For example, `jeq` tests for equality, `jgt` tests for greater than, and `jset` tests for bitwise AND operations. Each instruction is tested with different combinations of register values and immediate values to ensure comprehensive coverage of possible scenarios. The outcomes are determined based on whether the jump condition is met, whether the jump leads to an out-of-bounds error, or whether it results in a spin loop due to jumping to itself.

This file is not an executable but rather a collection of test cases intended to be run within a testing framework for the VM. It does not define public APIs or external interfaces but serves as an internal tool to verify the correctness of the VM's jump instruction logic. The tests ensure that the VM handles various edge cases and conditions correctly, which is critical for the stability and reliability of the VM's execution environment.
