Tests for left shift operations on 32-bit and 64-bit registers with immediate and register values.

# Purpose
The content is a configuration file that defines a series of operations for a virtual machine or an emulator, specifically focusing on left shift operations (`lsh`) with 32-bit and 64-bit registers. Each line represents an operation with specific parameters such as operation code (`op`), destination register (`dst`), source register (`src`), offset (`off`), initial register value (`rX`), and immediate value (`imm`). The result of the operation is indicated after the colon, showing the final value of the destination register. The file includes both valid operations, marked with `: ok`, and invalid operations, marked with `: vfy`, which are likely used for testing the handling of errors or edge cases. This file is relevant to the codebase as it provides a set of test cases or configurations for verifying the correct implementation of left shift operations in the system.
# Content Summary
The provided content is a configuration file that describes a series of operations for a hypothetical assembly-like language. The operations involve left shift (lsh) instructions for 32-bit and 64-bit registers, using both immediate values and register values as shift amounts. The file is structured to test various scenarios of these operations, including valid and invalid cases.

### Key Components:

1. **Operation Codes (op):** 
   - `op=64`, `op=6c`, and `op=67` represent different left shift operations. 
   - `op=64` and `op=6c` are for 32-bit left shifts, with `op=64` using an immediate value and `op=6c` using a register value for the shift amount.
   - `op=67` is for 64-bit left shifts using an immediate value.

2. **Destination and Source Registers (dst, src):**
   - `dst` specifies the destination register where the result of the operation is stored.
   - `src` specifies the source register or immediate value used for the shift operation.

3. **Offset (off):**
   - `off` is an offset value, which may be used for addressing or other purposes in the operation.

4. **Immediate Values (imm):**
   - `imm` is used in operations where an immediate value is specified for the shift amount.

5. **Register Values (r0, r1, ..., r9, r10):**
   - These represent the initial values of the registers before the operation is performed.

6. **Operation Results:**
   - The result of each operation is shown after the colon, indicating the new value of the destination register.

7. **Status Indicators:**
   - `ok` indicates a successful operation.
   - `vfy` indicates a verification step, often used to check for invalid operations or edge cases, such as invalid source or destination registers.

8. **Comments:**
   - Comments provide additional context, such as "zero" or "truncate upper," describing the expected behavior or purpose of the operation.

### Important Details for Developers:

- Developers should understand the distinction between operations using immediate values and those using register values for shifts.
- The file includes both valid operations and edge cases, such as invalid register references, which are marked with `vfy`.
- The operations test a range of shift amounts, from zero to large values, to ensure correct behavior across different scenarios.
- The file serves as a test suite for verifying the correctness of the left shift operations in the hypothetical language, ensuring that both normal and boundary conditions are handled correctly.
