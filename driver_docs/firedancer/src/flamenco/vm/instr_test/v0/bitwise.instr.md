Test cases for bitwise OR and AND operations on 32-bit and 64-bit registers with immediate and register operands.

# Purpose
The file contains a series of test cases for verifying the behavior of bitwise operations in a processor or emulator. Each line represents a test case for specific operations such as `or32`, `or64`, `and32`, and `and64`, which perform bitwise OR and AND operations on registers and immediate values. The test cases specify operation codes (`op`), destination registers (`dst`), source registers (`src`), offsets (`off`), and initial register values. The expected results are indicated after the colon, with comments explaining the outcome, such as truncation of upper bits or validation failures (`vfy`) for invalid source or destination registers. This file is crucial for ensuring that the bitwise operations execute correctly and handle edge cases as expected.
# Content Summary
The provided content is a series of test cases for bitwise operations in a software codebase. These operations include OR and AND operations on 32-bit and 64-bit registers, with both immediate values and register-to-register operations. Each test case is structured with specific fields and outcomes:

1. **Operation Codes**: Each line begins with an operation code (`op`) that specifies the type of operation. For example, `op=44` and `op=4c` represent OR operations with immediate values and registers, respectively, while `op=54` and `op=5c` represent AND operations.

2. **Destination and Source Registers**: The `dst` and `src` fields indicate the destination and source registers involved in the operation. The destination register is where the result of the operation is stored.

3. **Offset**: The `off` field represents an offset value, though its specific role in these operations is not detailed in the content.

4. **Initial Register Values**: The initial values of the registers (`r0`, `r1`, etc.) and immediate values (`imm`) are provided before the operation is executed.

5. **Expected Results**: After the operation, the expected result is shown, indicating the new value of the destination register. Comments such as `# truncate upper` and `# sign extend` describe specific behaviors like truncating higher bits or extending the sign bit.

6. **Verification Status**: Each test case ends with a status, either `ok` for successful operations or `vfy` for cases that require verification due to invalid source or destination registers.

7. **Invalid Cases**: Lines marked with `vfy` indicate invalid operations, such as using non-existent registers as sources or destinations.

These test cases are essential for verifying the correct implementation of bitwise operations in the software, ensuring that the operations produce the expected results under various conditions.
