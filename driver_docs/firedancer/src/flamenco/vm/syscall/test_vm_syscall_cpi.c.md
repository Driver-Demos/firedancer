Static assertions for structure layouts and a main function template for runtime tests.

# Purpose
The code is a C source file that includes a main function and a series of static assertions to verify the memory layout of various data structures. These structures are related to a virtual machine (VM) system, as indicated by the prefix `fd_vm_` in their names. The static assertions use `FD_STATIC_ASSERT` to ensure that the offsets and sizes of the fields within these structures match expected values. This is important for maintaining compatibility and correctness when interfacing with other components or systems that rely on these specific memory layouts.

The main function initializes the system by calling `fd_boot` with the command-line arguments and logs a notice indicating successful execution with `FD_LOG_NOTICE`. The function `fd_halt` is called before returning 0, which indicates successful termination of the program. The comment within the main function suggests that runtime tests are intended to be added, but they are not yet implemented. The file appears to be a test or validation suite for ensuring the correct layout of data structures used in a VM system, and it is likely intended to be executed as a standalone program.
# Imports and Dependencies

### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../../src/flamenco/vm/syscall/test_vm_syscall_cpi.c#L56>)

Initializes the system, logs a notice, and halts execution.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The count of command-line arguments.
    - `argv`: An array of strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Calls `fd_boot` with pointers to `argc` and `argv` to initialize the system.
    - Logs a notice message 'pass' using `FD_LOG_NOTICE`.
    - Calls `fd_halt` to stop the system.
    - Returns 0 to indicate successful execution.
- **Output**: Returns an integer 0, indicating successful execution.
