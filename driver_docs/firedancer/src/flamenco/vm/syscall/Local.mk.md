Build configuration for compiling and testing VM syscalls with specific dependencies and conditions.

# Purpose
The content is part of a Makefile used in a software build system. It includes conditional directives that check for the presence of certain features or environments, such as `FD_HAS_INT128`, `FD_HAS_HOSTED`, and `FD_HAS_SECP256K1`. If these conditions are met, the Makefile adds specific header files and object files to the build process using the `add-hdrs` and `add-objs` functions. It also defines unit tests for various components, such as `test_vm_syscall_cpi`, `test_vm_syscall_curve`, and `test_vm_syscalls`, using the `make-unit-test` function. Finally, it executes these unit tests with the `run-unit-test` function to ensure the correctness of the components within the specified environment.
