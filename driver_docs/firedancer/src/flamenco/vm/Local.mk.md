Makefile for building and testing components in the Flamenco VM, including unit tests and binaries.

# Purpose
The content is a Makefile script used to manage the build process of a software project. It includes conditional compilation directives, such as `ifdef FD_HAS_HOSTED`, `ifdef FD_HAS_INT128`, and `ifdef FD_HAS_SECP256K1`, which determine whether certain sections of the build process should be executed based on the presence of specific features or libraries. The script uses `$(call add-hdrs,...)` and `$(call add-objs,...)` to specify header files and object files that are part of the build, respectively. It also defines targets for building binaries and running unit tests, such as `fd_vm_tool` and various test cases like `test_vm_interp`, `test_vm_base`, and `test_pointer_chase`. The script ensures that dependencies, such as `fd_flamenco`, `fd_funk`, and `fd_ballet`, are included in the build process, and it manages the execution of unit tests to verify the functionality of different components.
