Defines the base structure and constants for a log collector with serialization and truncation features.

# Purpose
This code is a C header file that defines the base structure and constants for a log collector in the Flamenco logging system. It includes a guard to prevent multiple inclusions and imports a base header file. The file defines constants such as `FD_LOG_COLLECTOR_MAX`, which specifies the maximum number of bytes for log messages before truncation, and `FD_LOG_COLLECTOR_EXTRA`, which accounts for serialization overhead and additional space requirements. The `fd_log_collector` structure is defined to manage log data, including fields for buffer size, log size, truncation status, and whether transaction logs are enabled. The structure also contains a buffer array to store serialized log messages.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `../fd_flamenco_base.h`


# Global Variables

---
### FD\_PROTOTYPES\_END
- **Type**: `macro`
- **Description**: `FD_PROTOTYPES_END` is a macro used to mark the end of a section of function prototypes or declarations in the code. It is typically paired with `FD_PROTOTYPES_BEGIN` to encapsulate a block of code that contains function prototypes.
- **Use**: Marks the end of a block of function prototypes or declarations.


# Data Structures

---
### fd\_log\_collector
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `buf_sz`: The size of `buf` currently used, including serialization overheads.
    - `log_sz`: The total bytes count of logs inserted, up to `FD_LOG_COLLECTOR_MAX`.
    - `warn`: Indicates whether logs were truncated to match Agave's behavior.
    - `disabled`: Indicates whether transaction logs are disabled (1) or enabled (0).
    - `buf`: A serialized log buffer with a size of `FD_LOG_COLLECTOR_MAX + FD_LOG_COLLECTOR_EXTRA`.
- **Description**: Manages log collection by storing logs in a buffer with serialization overheads, tracking the size of logs inserted, and indicating if logs are truncated or if transaction logs are disabled.


---
### fd\_log\_collector\_t
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `buf_sz`: The size of `buf` currently used, including serialization overheads.
    - `log_sz`: The total bytes count of logs inserted, up to `FD_LOG_COLLECTOR_MAX`.
    - `warn`: Indicates whether logs were truncated to match Agave's behavior.
    - `disabled`: Indicates whether transaction logs are disabled (1) or enabled (0).
    - `buf`: A serialized log buffer with a size of `FD_LOG_COLLECTOR_MAX + FD_LOG_COLLECTOR_EXTRA`.
- **Description**: Manages log collection by storing log messages in a buffer, tracking the size of used and inserted logs, and indicating if logs are truncated or disabled.
