Makefile for managing headers, objects, and unit tests related to rewards in the Firedancer project.

# Purpose
This Makefile script conditionally includes headers and object files, and defines unit tests for a software project. If the macro `FD_HAS_INT128` is defined, it adds the headers `fd_rewards_base.h`, `fd_epoch_rewards.h`, and `fd_rewards.h` to the build process. It also adds the object files `fd_epoch_rewards` and `fd_rewards` with the dependency `fd_flamenco`. Additionally, it creates and runs a unit test named `test_epoch_rewards` with dependencies on `fd_flamenco`, `fd_util`, and `fd_ballet`.
