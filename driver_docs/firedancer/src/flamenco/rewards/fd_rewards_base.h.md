Defines constants for reward calculation parameters in the Flamenco rewards system.

# Purpose
This C header file defines several constants related to the calculation and distribution of rewards in a blockchain system. The `LAMPORTS_PER_SOL` constant specifies the number of lamports equivalent to one SOL, which is a unit of currency. The `REWARD_CALCULATION_NUM_BLOCKS` constant indicates the number of blocks after which reward distribution to stake accounts begins. The `STAKE_ACCOUNT_STORES_PER_BLOCK` constant defines the number of stake accounts that can be stored in a single block during a partitioned reward interval, targeting 64 rewards per entry or tick. Finally, the `MAX_FACTOR_OF_REWARD_BLOCKS_IN_EPOCH` constant sets the maximum factor of reward blocks within an epoch. These constants are used to configure the reward distribution mechanism in the blockchain system.
