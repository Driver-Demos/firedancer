Defines constants, macros, and data structures for encoding and managing transactions in a Solana-based system.

# Purpose
The code is a C header file that provides definitions and utility functions related to the Flamenco project. It includes constants, type definitions, and inline functions that are used for encoding data in base58 format, which is common in blockchain and cryptocurrency applications. The file includes other headers such as `fd_base58.h` and `fd_cast.h`, indicating dependencies on base58 encoding and type casting functionalities.

Key components of the file include macros for default values related to epochs and cluster versions, which are likely used in a distributed system or blockchain context. The file defines several structures and typedefs for various components like `fd_bank_t`, `fd_exec_txn_ctx_t`, and `fd_account_meta_t`, which suggest a focus on transaction and account management. The inline functions [`fd_base58_enc_32_fmt`](<#fd_base58_enc_32_fmt>) and [`fd_base58_enc_64_fmt`](<#fd_base58_enc_64_fmt>) provide base58 encoding capabilities with support for handling `NULL` inputs. The file also includes macros for allocating temporary buffers on the stack for base58 encoding, which are intended for use in non-recursive and non-looping contexts.

The actual structure definition is not provided in the given code, so details about its members and functionality are not available. It serves as a placeholder for a more complex data structure that is defined elsewhere in the codebase.


---
### fd\_banks\_t
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Description**: `fd_banks_t` is a typedef for a forward-declared `struct fd_banks`. The actual structure definition is not provided in the given code, so details about its members and functionality are not available. It serves as a placeholder for a more complex data structure that is defined elsewhere in the codebase.


---
### fd\_exec\_txn\_ctx\_t
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Description**: `fd_exec_txn_ctx_t` is a forward declaration of a `struct` named `fd_exec_txn_ctx`.

This `struct` is likely used in the context of transaction execution within the system.


---
### fd\_exec\_instr\_ctx\_t
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Description**: `fd_exec_instr_ctx_t` is a forward declaration of a `struct` named `fd_exec_instr_ctx`. The actual definition of the `struct` is not provided in the given code, so its members and functionality are not specified here. This `struct` is likely used in the context of executing instructions within a larger system, as suggested by its name.


---
### fd\_acc\_mgr\_t
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `fd_acc_mgr_t`: A typedef for the `struct fd_acc_mgr`.
- **Description**: The `fd_acc_mgr_t` is a typedef for a forward-declared structure `fd_acc_mgr`. This structure is part of a larger codebase related to account management, but the specific fields and functions associated with `fd_acc_mgr` are not defined in the provided code. The typedef allows for the use of `fd_acc_mgr_t` as a type name in the code, facilitating the management of account-related operations.

### fd\_capture\_ctx\_t
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Description**: The `fd_capture_ctx_t` is a typedef for a forward-declared `struct fd_capture_ctx`. The actual structure definition is not provided in the given code, so its members and functionality are not specified here. It is likely used as a context or state holder in the codebase where it is defined.


---
### fd\_borrowed\_account\_t
- **Type**: ``struct``

---
### fd\_progcache\_t
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Description**: `fd_progcache_t` is a typedef for a forward-declared `struct fd_progcache`. The actual structure definition is not provided in the given code, so details about its members and functionality are not available. It is likely used as a placeholder for a more complex data structure that is defined elsewhere in the codebase.


---
### fd\_runtime\_stack\_t
- **Type**: `union`
- **Description**: `fd_runtime_stack_t` is a typedef for a union named `fd_runtime_stack`. The code does not provide further details about the members or purpose of this union, indicating that it might be defined elsewhere or is intended to be defined later. As it stands, `fd_runtime_stack_t` serves as a placeholder for a union type, potentially used for runtime stack operations or management.
