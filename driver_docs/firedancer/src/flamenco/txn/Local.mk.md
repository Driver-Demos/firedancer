Makefile for conditionally adding headers and objects if 128-bit integers are available.

# Purpose
The content is a Makefile segment that conditionally includes headers and object files based on the presence of the `FD_HAS_INT128` macro. If `FD_HAS_INT128` is defined, it adds `fd_txn_generate.h` to the list of headers and `fd_txn_generate` and `fd_flamenco` to the list of object files for compilation. This ensures that these files are only included when the system supports 128-bit integers.
