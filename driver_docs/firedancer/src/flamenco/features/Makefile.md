Makefile for generating and formatting feature files using Python and Black.

# Purpose
This Makefile automates tasks for a Python project. It defines the `PYTHON` variable to specify the Python interpreter version as `python3.8` and the `BLACK` variable to format Python code using the `black` tool. The `generate` target, marked as `.PHONY`, depends on the `gen_features.py` script and `feature_map.json` file to produce `fd_features_generated.h` and `fd_features_generated.c`. The `format` target, also marked as `.PHONY`, formats the `gen_features.py` script using the `black` tool.
