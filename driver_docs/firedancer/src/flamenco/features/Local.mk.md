Makefile logic for adding headers and objects if 128-bit integer support is available.

# Purpose
The `Makefile` snippet uses conditional directives to manage the inclusion of headers and object files based on the presence of the `FD_HAS_INT128` macro. If `FD_HAS_INT128` is defined, it calls the `add-hdrs` function to include `fd_features.h` and `fd_features_generated.h` headers, and the `add-objs` function to include `fd_features`, `fd_features_generated`, and `fd_flamenco` object files. This ensures that the build process includes the necessary files when 128-bit integer support is available.
