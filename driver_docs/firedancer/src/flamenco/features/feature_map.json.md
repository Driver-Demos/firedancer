A JSON file listing various features with their names, public keys, and additional metadata for fuzzing.

# Purpose
The JSON file contains a list of feature configurations for a software system, each represented as an object with attributes such as `name`, `pubkey`, and optional attributes like `hardcode_for_fuzzing`, `cleaned_up`, `reverted`, and `comment`. Each feature is identified by a unique `name` and associated with a `pubkey`, which likely serves as a unique identifier or key for the feature. The `hardcode_for_fuzzing` attribute, when present, indicates that the feature is set for fuzz testing, a method used to discover coding errors and security loopholes. The `cleaned_up` attribute, when present, specifies the version numbers where cleanup or changes have been applied. The `reverted` attribute indicates features that have been rolled back. This file is crucial for managing and tracking the state and configuration of various features within the software, allowing developers to enable, disable, or modify features as needed during development and testing.
# Content Summary
The provided JSON configuration file contains a list of feature flags for a software system. Each feature flag is represented as an object with several key attributes:

1. **name**: This is a string that identifies the feature or functionality being controlled by the flag. It provides a descriptive name for the feature.

2. **pubkey**: This is a unique public key associated with the feature. It serves as an identifier for the feature within the system.

3. **hardcode_for_fuzzing**: This attribute, when present and set to 1, indicates that the feature is hardcoded for fuzz testing. Fuzz testing is a software testing technique used to find security vulnerabilities and bugs by inputting random data.

4. **cleaned_up**: This attribute, when present, is an array that specifies the version numbers (major, minor, patch) where the feature has been cleaned up or modified. It indicates the version of the software where changes to the feature have been finalized.

5. **reverted**: This attribute, when present and set to 1, indicates that the feature has been reverted, meaning it was previously enabled or modified but has been rolled back to a previous state.

6. **old**: This attribute, when present, provides the previous public key associated with the feature before it was updated or changed.

7. **comment**: This attribute, when present, provides additional information or instructions related to the feature. It may include notes on implementation or testing considerations.

The file serves as a configuration for enabling, disabling, or modifying features within the software system. Developers can use this file to understand which features are currently active, which are under testing, and any version-specific changes that have been applied. This configuration is crucial for managing feature rollouts, testing, and maintaining backward compatibility.
