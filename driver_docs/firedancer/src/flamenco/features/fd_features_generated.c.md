A generated C file defining feature IDs and their properties for a feature management system, including functions for querying feature IDs and verifying layout offsets.

# Purpose
The code defines a collection of feature identifiers for a software system, likely related to a blockchain or distributed ledger technology. Each feature is represented by a structure `fd_feature_id_t` that includes an index, a unique identifier (`id`), a name, and additional attributes such as `cleaned_up`, `hardcode_for_fuzzing`, and `reverted`. These features are stored in an array `ids`, which is used to manage and query the features based on their unique identifiers.

The code also includes a function [`fd_feature_id_query`](<#fd_feature_id_query>) that allows querying a feature by its prefix, returning a pointer to the corresponding feature identifier structure. The function uses a switch-case statement to match the prefix with the appropriate feature in the `ids` array. Additionally, the code contains static assertions to verify the correctness of the offset calculations for each feature within the `fd_features_t` structure. This ensures that the features are correctly aligned and accessible within the system.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `fd_features.h`
- `stddef.h`


# Global Variables

---
### ids
- **Type**: ``fd_feature_id_t const[]``
- **Description**: An array of constant `fd_feature_id_t` structures, each representing a feature with specific attributes such as index, id, name, and other properties. The array is initialized with multiple entries, each corresponding to a different feature in the system.
- **Use**: Used to store and manage feature identifiers and their associated metadata in a structured format.


# Functions

---
### fd\_feature\_id\_query<!-- {{#callable:fd_feature_id_query}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/flamenco/features/fd_features_generated.c#L1685>)

Returns a pointer to a `fd_feature_id_t` structure from the `ids` array based on a given `prefix` value.
- **Inputs**:
    - `prefix`: An unsigned long integer representing a specific prefix value to match against predefined cases.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Uses a `switch` statement to compare the `prefix` with predefined case values.
    - For each case, returns a pointer to a specific element in the `ids` array corresponding to the matched prefix.
    - If no case matches the `prefix`, the function returns `NULL`.
- **Output**: A pointer to a `fd_feature_id_t` structure if a match is found, otherwise `NULL`.
