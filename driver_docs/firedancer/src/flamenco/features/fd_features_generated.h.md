Header file generated by `gen_features.py` defining a union for feature flags with 245 feature IDs.

# Purpose
The code defines a union named `fd_features` that is used to manage a collection of feature flags within a system. Each feature flag is represented as an `ulong` and is associated with a unique identifier. The union contains an array `f` of `ulong` elements, with a size defined by the macro `FD_FEATURE_ID_CNT`, which is set to 245. Additionally, the union provides a structured way to access each feature flag individually through a series of named fields within a `struct`. These fields represent various features or capabilities that can be enabled or disabled within the system, such as `deprecate_rewards_sysvar`, `pico_inflation`, and `secp256k1_program_enabled`.

The file is intended to be included in other source files, as indicated by the preprocessor directive that checks for the inclusion of `fd_features.h`. It is not meant to be edited directly, as noted by the comment at the top of the file. The code also includes a conditional preprocessor directive to suppress a specific compiler warning when using GCC version 15 or higher. This file serves as a centralized definition of feature flags, which can be used to control the behavior of the system by toggling these flags on or off.

- **Description**: The `union fd_features` is a data structure that encapsulates a set of feature flags for a system, represented as an array of `ulong` values or as individual named `ulong` fields within a nested `struct`. Each field corresponds to a specific feature, identified by a unique hexadecimal value, and is used to enable or disable various functionalities within the system. The `FD_FEATURE_ID_CNT` macro defines the total number of features available, which is 245 in this case. This union allows for flexible access to feature flags either by index or by name, facilitating feature management and configuration.
