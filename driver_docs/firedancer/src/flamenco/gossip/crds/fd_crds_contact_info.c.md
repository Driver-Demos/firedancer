Defines a contact information entry structure and integrates it with a pool management system.

# Purpose
This code defines a structure and a type for managing contact information entries in a gossip protocol. The `fd_crds_contact_info_entry` structure contains an array of `fd_contact_info_t` and a nested structure with a `ulong` member named `next`, which is used for linking entries in a pool. The `typedef` creates an alias `fd_crds_contact_info_entry_t` for this structure. The code also sets up a pool for managing these entries by defining macros `POOL_NAME`, `POOL_T`, and `POOL_NEXT`, which are used in conjunction with the included template file `fd_pool.c` to implement pool management functionality. The inclusion of header files `fd_gossip_types.h` and `fd_gossip_private.h` suggests dependencies on types and functions defined elsewhere in the gossip protocol implementation.
# Imports and Dependencies

- `../../../util/tmpl/fd_pool.c`


# Data Structures

---
### fd\_crds\_contact\_info\_entry
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - ``contact_info``: An array of `fd_contact_info_t` with a single element.
    - ``pool.next``: An unsigned long integer that indicates the next element in the pool.
- **Description**: Defines a structure that contains contact information and a pool management field. The `contact_info` array holds a single contact information entry, while the `pool` structure contains a `next` field used for managing linked elements in a pool.

### fd\_crds\_contact\_info\_entry\_t
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - ``contact_info``: An array of `fd_contact_info_t` with a single element.
    - ``pool``: A nested structure containing a single member `next` of type `ulong`.
- **Description**: Defines a structure that contains contact information and a pool management field. The `contact_info` array holds a single `fd_contact_info_t` element, while the `pool` structure manages the next element in a pool using the `next` field.
