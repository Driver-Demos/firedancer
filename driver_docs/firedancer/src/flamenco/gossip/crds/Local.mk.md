Makefile for adding headers, objects, and running unit tests for CRDS in the Firedancer project.

# Purpose
The `Makefile` content defines build and test instructions for a software project. It uses the `add-hdrs` and `add-objs` functions to include the header file `fd_crds.h` and object files `fd_crds` and `fd_flamenco` in the build process. It also specifies a unit test named `test_crds`, which depends on the `fd_flamenco`, `fd_ballet`, and `fd_util` components, and includes instructions to run this unit test.
