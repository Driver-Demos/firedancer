Makefile for adding headers, objects, and unit tests for the gossip module in the Firedancer project.

# Purpose
The content is a Makefile script used to automate the build process of a software project. It defines targets for adding header files and object files to the build system using the `add-hdrs` and `add-objs` functions. The script specifies unit tests for various components such as `test_bloom`, `test_active_set`, `test_ping_tracker`, and `test_gossip`, and includes commands to compile and run these tests. Additionally, it conditionally includes a fuzz test for `fuzz_gossip_msg_parse` if the `FD_HAS_HOSTED` variable is defined, indicating that the fuzz test should only be executed in certain environments. This Makefile helps streamline the compilation and testing processes, ensuring that all necessary components are built and verified.
