Makefile for managing headers, objects, and unit tests in the `firedancer` codebase.

# Purpose
The content is a Makefile script that manages the build process for a software project. It uses conditional statements to check for the presence of certain features, such as `FD_HAS_INT128` and `FD_HAS_SECP256K1`, to determine which components to include in the build. The script adds header files and object files to the build process using the `add-hdrs` and `add-objs` functions. It also defines and runs unit tests for the `test_progcache` component, ensuring that the build includes necessary dependencies like `fd_flamenco`, `fd_funk`, `fd_ballet`, and `fd_util`. The script organizes both public APIs and internal components, facilitating a modular build process.
