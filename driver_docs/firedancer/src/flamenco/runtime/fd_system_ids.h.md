Defines constants for system and program IDs, and functions to check if a public key is reserved.

# Purpose
This C header file defines a collection of external constant variables and function prototypes related to system identifiers and reserved keys within a specific runtime environment. The file includes declarations for various public key identifiers (`fd_pubkey_t`) associated with system variables, Solana programs, and buffer accounts used in BPF migrations. It also provides function prototypes to check if a public key is an active or pending reserved key, or if it is associated with the `secp256r1` program. These identifiers and functions are used to manage and verify reserved accounts, ensuring that certain keys are not writable within the system. The file includes references to external documentation for further context on the usage and management of these identifiers.

### fd\_pubkey\_is\_active\_reserved\_key<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_pubkey_is_active_reserved_key}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/flamenco/runtime/fd_system_ids.h#L77>)

Checks if a public key is an active reserved key.
- **Description**: Use this function to determine if a given public key is part of the active reserved keys set. This is important for ensuring that the public key is not added to writable accounts in Agave's message cache. Call this function when you need to verify the status of a public key as an active reserved key. The function returns a boolean-like integer indicating the presence of the public key in the active reserved keys set.
- **Inputs**:
    - `acct`: A pointer to a `fd_pubkey_t` structure representing the public key to check. Must not be null. The function will return 0 if the pointer is null or if the public key is not in the active reserved keys set.
- **Output**: Returns 1 if the public key is in the active reserved keys set, and 0 otherwise.
- **See Also**: [`fd_pubkey_is_active_reserved_key`](<fd_system_ids.c.md#fd_pubkey_is_active_reserved_key>)  (Implementation)

### fd\_pubkey\_is\_pending\_reserved\_key<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_pubkey_is_pending_reserved_key}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/flamenco/runtime/fd_system_ids.h#L80>)

Checks if a public key is a pending reserved key.
- **Description**: Use this function to determine if a given public key is part of the set of pending reserved keys. This is important for managing access to certain resources, as reserved keys are not added to writable accounts. Call this function when you need to verify if a public key is pending reservation status. Ensure that the public key is valid and initialized before calling this function.
- **Inputs**:
    - `acct`: A pointer to a `fd_pubkey_t` structure representing the public key to check. Must not be null. The caller retains ownership of the memory. If the pointer is invalid, the behavior is undefined.
- **Output**: Returns 1 if the public key is a pending reserved key, and 0 otherwise.
- **See Also**: [`fd_pubkey_is_pending_reserved_key`](<fd_system_ids.c.md#fd_pubkey_is_pending_reserved_key>)  (Implementation)

### fd\_pubkey\_is\_secp256r1\_key<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_pubkey_is_secp256r1_key}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/flamenco/runtime/fd_system_ids.h#L83>)

Checks if a public key is the secp256r1 program ID.
- **Description**: Use this function to determine if a given public key corresponds to the secp256r1 program ID. This is useful for verifying if a public key is reserved and should not be added to writable accounts. The function returns a non-zero value if the public key matches the secp256r1 program ID, and zero otherwise. Ensure that the input public key is valid and initialized before calling this function.
- **Inputs**:
    - `acct`: A pointer to a `fd_pubkey_t` structure representing the public key to check. Must not be null and should point to a valid and initialized public key structure. The function will compare this key against the secp256r1 program ID.
