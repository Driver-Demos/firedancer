Makefile logic to conditionally add headers and objects if 128-bit integer support is available.

# Purpose
The `Makefile` snippet uses a conditional directive to check if the macro `FD_HAS_INT128` is defined. If it is defined, the script calls the `add-hdrs` function to include the header file `fd_instr_info.h` and calls the `add-objs` function to add the object files `fd_instr_info` and `fd_flamenco`. This setup is used to conditionally compile and link specific files based on the presence of the `FD_HAS_INT128` macro.
