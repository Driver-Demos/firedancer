Defines instructions and compute units for executing a ZK ElGamal proof program.

# Purpose
This C header file defines constants and a function prototype for a Zero-Knowledge (ZK) ElGamal Proof Program. It includes two other header files, `fd_exec_instr_ctx.h` and `fd_exec_txn_ctx.h`, which are likely related to execution context management. The file defines a series of macros that represent different instructions (`FD_ZKSDK_INSTR_{...}`) for the ZK ElGamal Proof Program, each associated with a unique `uchar` value. Additionally, it specifies the compute units required for each instruction, which are represented as unsigned long integers. The function prototype [`fd_executor_zk_elgamal_proof_program_execute`](<#fd_executor_zk_elgamal_proof_program_execute>) is declared, which takes a pointer to an `fd_exec_instr_ctx_t` structure as an argument, indicating its role in executing the defined instructions within a given context.

Executes a ZK ElGamal proof program instruction.
- **Description**: Use this function to execute a specific instruction within the ZK ElGamal proof program. It requires a valid execution context and checks if the program is enabled before proceeding. The function processes the instruction based on the first byte of the instruction data. If the instruction data is empty or invalid, it returns an error code. Ensure the context is properly initialized and the program feature is active before calling this function.
- **Inputs**:
    - `ctx`: A pointer to an `fd_exec_instr_ctx_t` structure that contains the execution context. This must not be null and must be properly initialized with valid instruction data. The caller retains ownership of this context.
- **Output**: Returns an integer status code indicating success or the type of error encountered, such as unsupported program ID or invalid instruction data.
- **See Also**: [`fd_executor_zk_elgamal_proof_program_execute`](<fd_zk_elgamal_proof_program.c.md#fd_executor_zk_elgamal_proof_program_execute>)  (Implementation)
