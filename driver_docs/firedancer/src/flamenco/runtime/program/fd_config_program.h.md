A native program for storing and managing lists of pubkeys with designated signers in accounts.

# Purpose
This C header file defines the interface for a configuration program within a runtime environment. The program implements a single instruction that facilitates the storage of lists of public keys (`pubkeys`) in accounts, with some of these keys designated as "signers." To modify the list of `pubkeys`, all designated signers must sign the instruction. The file includes necessary dependencies from `fd_flamenco_base.h` and `fd_exec_instr_ctx.h`, and it declares the function [`fd_config_program_execute`](<#fd_config_program_execute>), which serves as the entry point for processing instructions related to the configuration program. The program is associated with the address `Config1111111111111111111111111111111111111`.
# Imports and Dependencies

[View Source →](<../../../../../../src/flamenco/runtime/program/fd_config_program.h#L15>)

Processes a configuration program instruction.
- **Description**: Use this function to execute a configuration program instruction within the given execution context. It checks if the program is a migrated native program and returns an error if so. This function updates the compute units and processes the instruction. Call this function when you need to handle a configuration program instruction in the context of a transaction. Ensure that the execution context is properly initialized before calling this function.
- **Inputs**:
    - `ctx`: A pointer to an `fd_exec_instr_ctx_t` structure that represents the execution context for the instruction. This must not be null and must be properly initialized before calling the function. The caller retains ownership of this context.
- **Output**: Returns an integer status code. If the program is a migrated native program, it returns `FD_EXECUTOR_INSTR_ERR_UNSUPPORTED_PROGRAM_ID`. Otherwise, it returns the result of processing the configuration instruction.
- **See Also**: [`fd_config_program_execute`](<fd_config_program.c.md#fd_config_program_execute>)  (Implementation)
