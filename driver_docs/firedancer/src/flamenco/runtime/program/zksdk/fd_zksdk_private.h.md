Header file for defining structures, constants, and macros for zero-knowledge proof verification functions.

# Purpose
The code is a C header file that defines internal components and functions for a zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) system. It includes various headers related to ZKP, such as `fd_zksdk.h`, `fd_zksdk_transcript.h`, and `fd_rangeproofs.h`, which suggest that it is part of a larger cryptographic library. The file defines constants, structures, and function prototypes that are used to verify different types of cryptographic proofs, such as zero ciphertext, ciphertext equality, and public key validity. These components are essential for ensuring the integrity and validity of cryptographic operations within the system.

The file also defines macros and constants for handling errors and managing basepoints for Pedersen commitments, which are used in cryptographic proofs. It includes arrays that specify the sizes of context and proof structures for various verification instructions, indicating that the file is designed to handle multiple types of proofs. The use of macros to define verification functions (`DEFINE_VERIFY_PROOF`) suggests a consistent interface for proof verification, which is crucial for maintaining the modularity and extensibility of the cryptographic library. The file is intended for internal use within the library, as indicated by its inclusion of private headers and its focus on defining internal structures and functions.

# Global Variables

---
### fd\_zksdk\_context\_sz
- **Type**: ``ulong[]``
- **Description**: An array of unsigned long integers that stores the size of context structures for various zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) verification instructions. Each element in the array corresponds to a specific instruction and holds the size of the context structure required for that instruction.
- **Use**: Used to determine the size of context structures needed for different ZKP verification instructions.

### fd\_zksdk\_proof\_sz
- **Type**: ``ulong[]``
- **Description**: An array of unsigned long integers that stores the sizes of different proof structures used in zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) verification instructions. Each element in the array corresponds to the size of a specific proof type, such as zero ciphertext proof, ciphertext equality proof, and others.
- **Use**: Used to determine the size of proof structures for various ZKP verification instructions.


---
### DEFINE\_VERIFY\_PROOF
- **Type**: `macro`
- **Description**: Defines a macro `DEFINE_VERIFY_PROOF` that generates function prototypes for verifying different types of zero-knowledge proofs. Each function prototype is named `fd_zksdk_instr_verify_proof_<name>` and takes two constant void pointers as parameters, representing the context and the proof.
- **Use**: Used to declare function prototypes for various zero-knowledge proof verification functions in a consistent manner.


# Data Structures

---
### fd\_zksdk\_proof\_ctx\_state\_meta
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `ctx_state_authority`: Holds the public key authority for the context state.
    - `proof_type`: Indicates the type of proof as an unsigned character.
- **Description**: Defines metadata for a proof context state, including the authority's public key and the type of proof, and is packed to minimize memory usage.


---
### fd\_zksdk\_proof\_ctx\_state\_meta\_t
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `ctx_state_authority`: Holds the public key authority for the context state.
    - `proof_type`: Indicates the type of proof as an unsigned character.
- **Description**: `fd_zksdk_proof_ctx_state_meta_t` is a packed structure that contains metadata for a proof context state in the Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) SDK. It includes a public key (`ctx_state_authority`) that represents the authority of the context state and a `proof_type` that specifies the type of proof being handled. This structure is used to manage and verify different types of proofs within the ZKP framework.
