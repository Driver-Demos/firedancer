Defines data structures and a function to verify ciphertext and commitment equality proofs.

# Purpose
This C header file defines data structures and a function for verifying the equality between a ciphertext and a commitment in a zero-knowledge proof context. It includes the `fd_flamenco_base.h` header, which suggests dependencies on foundational cryptographic operations. The `fd_zksdk_ciph_comm_eq_proof` structure holds proof data, including points and scalars, while the `fd_zksdk_ciph_comm_eq_context` structure contains the public key, ciphertext, and commitment, all represented as byte arrays. The function [`fd_zksdk_verify_proof_ciphertext_commitment_equality`](<#fd_zksdk_verify_proof_ciphertext_commitment_equality>) is declared to verify the proof of equality between the ciphertext and commitment using the provided public key and transcript. The use of `__attribute__((packed))` ensures that the structures are tightly packed without padding, which is important for cryptographic data integrity.

### fd\_zksdk\_verify\_proof\_ciphertext\_commitment\_equality<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_zksdk_verify_proof_ciphertext_commitment_equality}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../../../../src/flamenco/runtime/program/zksdk/instructions/fd_zksdk_ciphertext_commitment_equality.h#L23>)

Verifies the equality of a ciphertext and commitment proof.
- **Description**: Use this function to verify that a given proof demonstrates the equality between a ciphertext and a commitment. This function requires a valid proof, public key, ciphertext, and commitment, along with a transcript for challenge extraction. It is important to ensure that all inputs are correctly formatted and valid before calling this function. The function will return an error code if any input validation fails or if the proof does not verify successfully.
- **Inputs**:
    - `proof`: A pointer to a `fd_zksdk_ciph_comm_eq_proof_t` structure containing the proof data. Must not be null and must contain valid scalar and point data.
    - `pubkey`: A 32-byte array representing the public key. Must not be null and must be a valid point.
    - `ciphertext`: A 64-byte array representing the ciphertext, consisting of two points. Must not be null and must contain valid point data.
    - `commitment`: A 32-byte array representing the commitment. Must not be null and must be a valid point.
    - `transcript`: A pointer to a `fd_zksdk_transcript_t` structure used for challenge extraction. Must not be null and should be properly initialized before use.
- **Output**: Returns an integer indicating success or failure. A successful verification returns `FD_EXECUTOR_INSTR_SUCCESS`, while a failure returns `FD_ZKSDK_VERIFY_PROOF_ERROR`.
- **See Also**: [`fd_zksdk_verify_proof_ciphertext_commitment_equality`](<fd_zksdk_ciphertext_commitment_equality.c.md#fd_zksdk_verify_proof_ciphertext_commitment_equality>)  (Implementation)
