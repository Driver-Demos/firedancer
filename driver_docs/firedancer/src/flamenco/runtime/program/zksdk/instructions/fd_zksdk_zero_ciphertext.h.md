Defines packed structures for zero-knowledge proof and context in the Firedancer ZK-SDK.

# Purpose
This C header file defines data structures related to zero-knowledge proofs in the context of cryptographic operations. It includes the `fd_zksdk_zero_ciphertext_proof` structure, which contains three 32-byte arrays representing cryptographic points and a scalar, and the `fd_zksdk_zero_ciphertext_context` structure, which includes a 32-byte public key and a 64-byte ciphertext. Both structures are packed to ensure no padding is added between fields, which is important for cryptographic data integrity. The file also includes a necessary header, `fd_flamenco_base.h`, which likely provides foundational definitions or functions used in conjunction with these structures.

# Data Structures

---
### fd\_zksdk\_zero\_ciphertext\_proof
- **Type**: ``struct fd_zksdk_zero_ciphertext_proof``
- **Members**:
    - ``yp``: An array of 32 unsigned characters representing a point.
    - ``yd``: An array of 32 unsigned characters representing a point.
    - ``z``: An array of 32 unsigned characters representing a scalar.
- **Description**: A packed structure used to represent a zero-knowledge proof for ciphertext, containing two points (`yp` and `yd`) and a scalar (`z`), each stored as an array of 32 unsigned characters.

### fd\_zksdk\_zero\_ciphertext\_proof\_t
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `yp`: An array of 32 unsigned characters representing a point.
    - `yd`: An array of 32 unsigned characters representing a point.
    - `z`: An array of 32 unsigned characters representing a scalar.
- **Description**: Defines a packed structure for a zero-knowledge proof related to ciphertext, containing two points (`yp` and `yd`) and a scalar (`z`), each represented as an array of 32 unsigned characters.


---
### fd\_zksdk\_zero\_ciphertext\_context
- **Type**: ``struct fd_zksdk_zero_ciphertext_context``
- **Members**:
    - ``pubkey``: An array of 32 unsigned characters representing a point.
    - ``ciphertext``: An array of 64 unsigned characters representing two points.
- **Description**: A packed structure used to store a public key and ciphertext, where the public key is a 32-byte point and the ciphertext is a 64-byte representation of two points.


---
### fd\_zksdk\_zero\_ciphertext\_context\_t
- **Type**: ``struct fd_zksdk_zero_ciphertext_context``
- **Members**:
    - ``pubkey``: An array of 32 unsigned characters representing a point.
    - ``ciphertext``: An array of 64 unsigned characters representing two points.
- **Description**: Defines a context for zero-knowledge proofs related to ciphertexts, containing a public key and a ciphertext, both represented as arrays of unsigned characters.
