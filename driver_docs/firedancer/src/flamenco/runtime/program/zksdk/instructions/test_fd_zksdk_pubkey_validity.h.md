Header file for testing public key validity in the ZK-SDK with predefined transaction data.

# Purpose
This C header file defines a static array of character strings named `tx_pubkey_validity`, which contains hexadecimal values related to public key validity tests. The array is likely used for testing or validating public keys within a cryptographic context, as suggested by the inclusion of terms like "VerifyPubkeyValidity" and "ZkE1Gama1Proof". The file also defines a constant `instr_offset_pubkey_validity` with a value of 351, which may represent an offset or index used in conjunction with the public key validity data. The header file includes another header, `fd_zksdk_private.h`, indicating that it relies on private definitions or functions from the `fd_zksdk` library. The presence of a `TODO` comment suggests that the validity tests may require further development or revision.
# Imports and Dependencies

- `../fd_zksdk_private.h`


# Global Variables

---
### tx\_pubkey\_validity
- **Type**: ``char *` array`
- **Description**: An array of strings that represent various hexadecimal values and identifiers related to public key validity. The array includes elements that seem to be cryptographic proofs, context identifiers, and other related data.
- **Use**: Used to store and access data related to the validity of public keys in a cryptographic context.


---
### instr\_offset\_pubkey\_validity
- **Type**: ``const ulong``
- **Description**: Defines a constant unsigned long integer with a value of 351.
- **Use**: Indicates an offset value related to public key validity instructions.
