Makefile instructions for adding object files related to ZK-SDK functionalities if 128-bit integers are supported.

# Purpose
The provided content is a section of a Makefile that conditionally adds object files to a build process. The `ifdef FD_HAS_INT128` directive checks if the `FD_HAS_INT128` macro is defined, indicating support for 128-bit integers. If this condition is true, the `add-objs` function is called multiple times to include various object files related to zero-knowledge SDK (ZKSDK) functionalities, such as zero ciphertext, ciphertext equality, commitment equality, public key validity, and various batched range proofs. Each call to `add-objs` associates these object files with the `fd_flamenco` target, which is likely a component or module within the build system. This setup ensures that these specific object files are only included in the build when the system supports 128-bit integer operations.
