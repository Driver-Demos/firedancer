Defines data structures for ciphertext equality proofs and contexts in the Firedancer codebase.

# Purpose
This C header file defines data structures related to ciphertext equality proofs in a zero-knowledge SDK. It includes the `fd_zksdk_ciph_ciph_eq_proof` structure, which is packed and contains arrays of unsigned characters (`uchar`) representing points and scalars used in the proof. The `fd_zksdk_ciph_ciph_eq_context` structure, also packed, holds public keys and ciphertexts, each represented as arrays of `uchar`. These structures are used to facilitate operations involving the verification of ciphertext equality in cryptographic protocols. The file includes a base header file, `fd_flamenco_base.h`, which likely provides foundational definitions or functions used in conjunction with these structures.

# Data Structures

---
### fd\_zksdk\_ciph\_ciph\_eq\_proof
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `y0`: An array of 32 unsigned characters representing a point.
    - `y1`: An array of 32 unsigned characters representing a point.
    - `y2`: An array of 32 unsigned characters representing a point.
    - `y3`: An array of 32 unsigned characters representing a point.
    - `zs`: An array of 32 unsigned characters representing a scalar.
    - `zx`: An array of 32 unsigned characters representing a scalar.
    - `zr`: An array of 32 unsigned characters representing a scalar.
- **Description**: Represents a packed structure for a ciphertext equality proof, containing four point arrays (`y0`, `y1`, `y2`, `y3`) and three scalar arrays (`zs`, `zx`, `zr`), each consisting of 32 unsigned characters.

### fd\_zksdk\_ciph\_ciph\_eq\_proof\_t
- **Type**: ``struct fd_zksdk_ciph_ciph_eq_proof``
- **Members**:
    - ``y0``: An array of 32 unsigned characters representing a point.
    - ``y1``: An array of 32 unsigned characters representing a point.
    - ``y2``: An array of 32 unsigned characters representing a point.
    - ``y3``: An array of 32 unsigned characters representing a point.
    - ``zs``: An array of 32 unsigned characters representing a scalar.
    - ``zx``: An array of 32 unsigned characters representing a scalar.
    - ``zr``: An array of 32 unsigned characters representing a scalar.
- **Description**: Represents a proof structure for ciphertext equality, containing four points (`y0`, `y1`, `y2`, `y3`) and three scalars (`zs`, `zx`, `zr`), each stored as an array of 32 unsigned characters. This structure is packed to ensure no padding is added between its members.


---
### fd\_zksdk\_ciph\_ciph\_eq\_context
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `pubkey1`: An array of 32 unsigned characters representing a point.
    - `pubkey2`: An array of 32 unsigned characters representing a point.
    - `ciphertext1`: An array of 64 unsigned characters representing two points.
    - `ciphertext2`: An array of 64 unsigned characters representing two points.
- **Description**: Defines a packed structure that holds two public keys and two ciphertexts, each represented as arrays of unsigned characters. The public keys are 32 bytes each, and the ciphertexts are 64 bytes each, indicating they contain two points.


---
### fd\_zksdk\_ciph\_ciph\_eq\_context\_t
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `pubkey1`: A 32-byte array representing a point.
    - `pubkey2`: A 32-byte array representing a point.
    - `ciphertext1`: A 64-byte array representing two points.
    - `ciphertext2`: A 64-byte array representing two points.
- **Description**: Contains public keys and ciphertexts, each represented as byte arrays, used in ciphertext equality operations.
