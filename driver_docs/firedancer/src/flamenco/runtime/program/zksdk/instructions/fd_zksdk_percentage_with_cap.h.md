Defines data structures for percentage proofs with a cap in the Firedancer Flamenco runtime.

# Purpose
This C header file defines data structures for handling percentage proofs with a cap, likely in a cryptographic context. It includes the `fd_flamenco_base.h` header, suggesting integration with a larger framework. The file defines three main structures: `percentage_max_proof`, `percentage_equality_proof`, and `fd_zksdk_percentage_with_cap_proof`, each marked with the `__attribute__((packed))` attribute to ensure no padding is added between fields. These structures store cryptographic data such as points and scalars, each represented as arrays of unsigned characters (`uchar`). Additionally, the `fd_zksdk_percentage_with_cap_context` structure holds commitments and a maximum value, facilitating the management of percentage proofs with a cap.
