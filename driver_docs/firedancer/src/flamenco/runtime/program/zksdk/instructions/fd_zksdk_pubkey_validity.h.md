Defines structures for public key validity proof and context in the Firedancer ZK-SDK.

# Purpose
This code is a C header file that defines data structures related to public key validity in a zero-knowledge SDK. It includes the `fd_flamenco_base.h` header file, which suggests a dependency on foundational components. The file defines two packed structures: `fd_zksdk_pubkey_validity_proof` and `fd_zksdk_pubkey_validity_context`. The `fd_zksdk_pubkey_validity_proof` structure contains two arrays of type `uchar`, `y` and `z`, each with a size of 32 bytes, representing a point and a scalar, respectively. The `fd_zksdk_pubkey_validity_context` structure contains a single 32-byte `uchar` array named `pubkey`, representing a public key point. These structures are used to handle data related to public key validity proofs and contexts in the SDK.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `../../../../fd_flamenco_base.h`


# Data Structures

---
### fd\_zksdk\_pubkey\_validity\_proof
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `y`: An array of 32 unsigned characters representing a point.
    - `z`: An array of 32 unsigned characters representing a scalar.
- **Description**: Defines a packed structure that contains two arrays of unsigned characters, `y` and `z`, each of size 32, used to represent a point and a scalar respectively in the context of public key validity proof.


---
### fd\_zksdk\_pubkey\_validity\_proof\_t
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `y`: An array of 32 unsigned characters representing a point.
    - `z`: An array of 32 unsigned characters representing a scalar.
- **Description**: Defines a packed structure that contains cryptographic elements used for public key validity proofs, specifically a point and a scalar, each represented as an array of 32 unsigned characters.


---
### fd\_zksdk\_pubkey\_validity\_context
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - ``pubkey``: An array of 32 unsigned characters representing a point.
- **Description**: Defines a packed structure that contains a single member, `pubkey`, which is an array of 32 bytes used to represent a public key point in the context of zero-knowledge SDK operations.


---
### fd\_zksdk\_pubkey\_validity\_context\_t
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - ``pubkey``: An array of 32 unsigned characters representing a point.
- **Description**: Defines a context for public key validity, containing a single member `pubkey`, which is a 32-byte array used to store a point.
