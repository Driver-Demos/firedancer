Bash script to recreate a ledger with ZK SDK transactions using Solana and SPL Token dependencies.

# Purpose
This Bash script automates the process of creating and managing a ledger with Zero-Knowledge (ZK) SDK transactions using the Solana blockchain and the SPL Token program. It is an executable script that requires dependencies on `solana` and `spl-token` command-line tools. The script checks for the presence of necessary configurations and credentials for both the default user and a user named Alice. It performs several operations, including funding Alice's account, creating a token and token account, configuring confidential transfers, minting tokens, and executing confidential transactions. The script is intended to be run in an environment where a Solana test validator is active, as indicated by the prerequisite command to reset the validator.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `spl-token`
- `solana`


# Global Variables

---
### SOLANA
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: The `SOLANA` variable is a string that stores the path to the Solana command-line tool executable. It is initially set to 'solana' and then updated to '../solana/target/debug/solana', which indicates a specific build of the Solana tool located in a relative directory path.
- **Use**: Used to execute Solana CLI commands within the script.


---
### TOKEN
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: `TOKEN` is a global variable that stores the path to the `spl-token` executable. It is initially set to the string 'spl-token' and then redefined to point to the debug build of the `spl-token` executable located in the `solana-program-library` directory.
- **Use**: Used to execute `spl-token` commands for managing token operations in the script.


---
### CONF
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: The `CONF` variable is a string that stores the file path to the Solana CLI configuration file, specifically located at `~/.config/solana/cli/config.yml`. This file contains configuration settings for the Solana command-line interface.
- **Use**: Used to verify the existence of the Solana CLI configuration file during the execution of the script.


---
### ALICE\_CONF
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: The `ALICE_CONF` variable is a string that stores the file path to Alice's Solana CLI configuration file. This file is located at `~/.config/solana/cli/alice.yml`.
- **Use**: Used to specify the configuration file for Alice when executing Solana CLI commands.


---
### CRED
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: The `CRED` variable is a string that stores the file path to the Solana credentials JSON file. This file contains the necessary credentials for Solana operations.
- **Use**: Used to verify the existence of Solana credentials in the `check_solana` function.


---
### ALICE\_CRED
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: The `ALICE_CRED` variable is a string that stores the file path to Alice's credentials JSON file, located at `~/.config/solana/alice.json`. This file contains the necessary credentials for Alice to interact with the Solana blockchain.
- **Use**: Used to verify the existence of Alice's credentials file in the `check_alice` function.


# Functions

---
### check\_solana
Checks if the Solana command-line tool and its necessary configuration and credentials files are available.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Runs the `solana help` command and checks if it executes without error.
    - If the `solana help` command fails, it prints an error message and exits with status 1.
    - Checks if the credentials file located at the path stored in `CRED` exists.
    - If the credentials file does not exist, it prints an error message and exits with status 1.
    - Checks if the configuration file located at the path stored in `CONF` exists.
    - If the configuration file does not exist, it prints an error message and exits with status 1.
- **Output**: No output is returned if all checks pass; otherwise, it prints an error message and exits the script.


---
### check\_spl\_token
Checks if the `spl-token` command is available in the system.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Execute the `spl-token help` command and redirect its output to `/dev/null`.
    - Check the exit status of the previous command.
    - If the exit status is not zero, print 'spl-token: command not found' and exit the script with status 1.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it exits the script if the `spl-token` command is not found.


---
### check\_alice
Checks if Alice's credentials and configuration files exist.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Use the `ls` command to check if the file path stored in `ALICE_CRED` exists.
    - If the file does not exist, print an error message 'solana: Alice credentials not found' and exit with status 1.
    - Use the `ls` command to check if the file path stored in `ALICE_CONF` exists.
    - If the file does not exist, print an error message 'solana: Alice config not found' and exit with status 1.
- **Output**: No output is returned if both checks pass; otherwise, the function exits with an error message.
