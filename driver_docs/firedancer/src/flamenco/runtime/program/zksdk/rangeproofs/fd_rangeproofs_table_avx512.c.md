Contains static constant data structures for cryptographic range proofs using the Ristretto255 curve.

# Purpose
The code is a static collection of constant data structures used in cryptographic operations, specifically for range proofs using the Ristretto255 curve. It defines an array named `fd_rangeproofs_generators_H` of type `fd_ristretto255_point_t`, containing 256 elements. Each element is a structure with three arrays of hexadecimal values, likely representing compressed points on the Ristretto255 curve. These points serve as base points and generators in Pedersen commitments, a cryptographic technique for encoding and committing to values while keeping them hidden. The file is auto-generated and not intended for direct modification or inclusion; it should be accessed through a larger cryptographic library or application, specifically via the `fd_rangeproofs.h` header file. The code does not define any public APIs or external interfaces and is used internally for efficient cryptographic computations.

### fd\_rangeproofs\_basepoint\_H
- **Type**: ``fd_ristretto255_point_t``
- **Description**: A static constant array of type `fd_ristretto255_point_t` that contains a single element representing a point on the Ristretto255 curve. The point is defined by three arrays of 64-bit integers, each containing eight elements, which represent the coordinates of the point in a compressed form.
- **Use**: Used as a base point in cryptographic operations involving range proofs.

### fd\_rangeproofs\_generators\_G
- **Type**: ``fd_ristretto255_point_t[256]``
- **Description**: An array of 256 elements, each of type `fd_ristretto255_point_t`, which represents points on the Ristretto255 curve. Each element in the array is initialized with specific values that are likely precomputed points used in cryptographic operations.
- **Use**: Used to store precomputed Ristretto255 points for range proofs in cryptographic operations.

### fd\_rangeproofs\_generators\_H
- **Type**: ``fd_ristretto255_point_t[256]``
- **Description**: The `fd_rangeproofs_generators_H` is a static constant array of type `fd_ristretto255_point_t` with 256 elements. Each element in the array is a structure that contains three arrays of eight 64-bit unsigned integers. These structures represent points on the Ristretto255 curve, which is a prime-order group used in cryptographic operations.
- **Use**: Used to store precomputed points on the Ristretto255 curve for range proof generation.
