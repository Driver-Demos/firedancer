Defines constants and precomputed tables for cryptographic operations using the Ristretto255 group.

# Purpose
The header file defines constants and precomputed tables for cryptographic operations related to the Ristretto255 group, which is based on the Edwards25519 curve. It includes arrays such as `fd_rangeproofs_basepoint_G`, `fd_rangeproofs_basepoint_H`, and `fd_rangeproofs_generators_G`, which are used in Pedersen commitments to encode messages and commitment openings. Additionally, the file contains a static array `fd_rangeproofs_generators_H`, which consists of precomputed elliptic curve points represented as nested arrays of hexadecimal values. These points are used for cryptographic protocols like range proofs. The file is auto-generated and intended for internal use within a cryptographic library, as indicated by the use of static and const keywords, ensuring the data is read-only and confined to the file. The file should be included through `fd_rangeproofs.h` and not directly, as enforced by a preprocessor directive.
# Global Variables

---
### fd\_rangeproofs\_basepoint\_G
- **Type**: ``fd_ristretto255_point_t` array`
- **Description**: A static constant array of type `fd_ristretto255_point_t` with a single element. It represents a base point used in range proofs, initialized with specific compressed coordinates.
- **Use**: Used as a base point in cryptographic range proof operations.


---
### fd\_rangeproofs\_basepoint\_H
- **Type**: ``fd_ristretto255_point_t` array`
- **Description**: A static constant array of type `fd_ristretto255_point_t` that contains a single element representing a point on the Ristretto255 curve. The point is defined using four sets of five 64-bit integers, which are likely used to store the coordinates and other related data of the point in a compressed form.
- **Use**: Used as a base point in cryptographic operations involving range proofs.


---
### fd\_rangeproofs\_generators\_G
- **Type**: ``fd_ristretto255_point_t[256]``
- **Description**: An array of 256 constant `fd_ristretto255_point_t` elements, each representing a point on the Ristretto255 curve. Each element in the array is a structure containing four nested arrays of five 64-bit unsigned integers, which represent the coordinates of the point in a compressed form.
- **Use**: Used to store precomputed generator points for range proofs in cryptographic operations.


---
### fd\_rangeproofs\_generators\_H
- **Type**: ``fd_ristretto255_point_t[256]``
- **Description**: An array of 256 constant `fd_ristretto255_point_t` structures. Each element in the array represents a point on the Ristretto255 curve, which is a prime-order group used in cryptographic operations. The points are stored in a compressed format, and each point consists of four 64-bit integers and one 64-bit integer set to 1, representing the identity element in the group.
- **Use**: Used to store precomputed points on the Ristretto255 curve for cryptographic operations.
