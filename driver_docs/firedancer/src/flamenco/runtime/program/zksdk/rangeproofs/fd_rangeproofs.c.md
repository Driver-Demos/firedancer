Implements functions for validating, computing, and verifying range proofs using Curve25519 operations.

# Purpose
The code is a C implementation for verifying range proofs, specifically designed to handle batched range proofs for different bit lengths such as `u64`, `u128`, and `u256`. It includes functions to validate bit lengths, compute deltas, and verify range proofs using multi-scalar multiplication (MSM) with the Ristretto255 curve. The [`fd_rangeproofs_verify`](<#fd_rangeproofs_verify>) function is the main component, which validates inputs, computes necessary scalars, and performs the final MSM to verify the proof. The code statically allocates memory for `u256` and dynamically handles smaller bit lengths, optimizing memory usage and reducing memory copies.

The implementation includes several key functions: [`batched_range_proof_validate_bits`](<#batched_range_proof_validate_bits>) checks if the bit length is valid, [`fd_rangeproofs_delta`](<#fd_rangeproofs_delta>) computes a delta value used in the verification process, and [`fd_rangeproofs_verify`](<#fd_rangeproofs_verify>) performs the actual verification of the range proof. The code uses a transcript to manage challenges and validate points, ensuring the integrity of the proof. It also includes comments that explain the differences from a similar Rust implementation, highlighting the static memory allocation and the order of points and scalars. The code is intended to be part of a larger library, as indicated by the inclusion of the header file `fd_rangeproofs.h` and the use of external functions and constants.

### batched\_range\_proof\_validate\_bits<!-- {{#callable:batched_range_proof_validate_bits}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../../../../src/flamenco/runtime/program/zksdk/rangeproofs/fd_rangeproofs.c#L3>)

Validates if a given bit length is one of the predefined acceptable values.
- **Inputs**:
    - `bit_length`: An unsigned long integer representing the bit length to validate.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Checks if `bit_length` is equal to any of the predefined values: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, or 128.
    - If `bit_length` matches one of these values, returns `FD_RANGEPROOFS_SUCCESS`.
    - If `bit_length` does not match any of these values, returns `FD_RANGEPROOFS_ERROR`.
- **Output**: Returns `FD_RANGEPROOFS_SUCCESS` if the bit length is valid, otherwise returns `FD_RANGEPROOFS_ERROR`.

### fd\_rangeproofs\_delta<!-- {{#callable:fd_rangeproofs_delta}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../../../../src/flamenco/runtime/program/zksdk/rangeproofs/fd_rangeproofs.c#L14>)

Computes a delta value used in range proofs by performing scalar operations on input arrays.
- **Inputs**:
    - `delta`: An array of 32 unsigned characters where the computed delta value will be stored.
    - `nm`: An unsigned long integer representing the total bit length, which should be a power of 2.
    - `y`: An array of 32 unsigned characters representing a scalar value used in computations.
    - `z`: An array of 32 unsigned characters representing another scalar value used in computations.
    - `zz`: An array of 32 unsigned characters representing yet another scalar value used in computations.
    - `bit_lengths`: An array of unsigned characters representing the bit lengths for each batch.
    - `batch_len`: An unsigned character representing the number of batches.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Copies the contents of `y` into `exp_y` and initializes `sum_of_powers_y` by adding `y` to the scalar one.
    - Iterates over `nm`, halving it each time, to compute powers of `exp_y` and accumulate them into `sum_of_powers_y`.
    - Subtracts `zz` from `z` and multiplies the result by `sum_of_powers_y`, storing the result in `delta`.
    - Negates `zz` into `neg_exp_z` and iterates over `batch_len` to compute and accumulate values into `delta` using `neg_exp_z` and `sum_2`.
- **Output**: The function outputs the computed delta value in the `delta` array.

### fd\_rangeproofs\_verify<!-- {{#callable:fd_rangeproofs_verify}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../../../../src/flamenco/runtime/program/zksdk/rangeproofs/fd_rangeproofs.c#L47>)

Verifies a range proof by computing a multi-scalar multiplication (MSM) and checking if the result equals the negation of a given point.
- **Inputs**:
    - `range_proof`: A pointer to a `fd_rangeproofs_range_proof_t` structure containing the range proof data.
    - `ipp_proof`: A pointer to a `fd_rangeproofs_ipp_proof_t` structure containing the inner product proof data.
    - `commitments`: An array of 32 unsigned characters representing the commitments.
    - `bit_lengths`: An array of 1 unsigned character representing the bit lengths of the proofs.
    - `batch_len`: An unsigned character representing the number of proofs in the batch.
    - `transcript`: A pointer to a `fd_merlin_transcript_t` structure used for maintaining the transcript of the proof verification process.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Initialize constants and memory for scalars and points.
    - Validate the bit lengths of the batch and ensure the total bit length matches the expected value.
    - Validate the input scalars and decompress the input points into the `points` array.
    - Finalize the transcript and extract challenges for the proof verification.
    - Compute the necessary scalars for the MSM using the challenges and input data.
    - Perform the MSM using the computed scalars and points.
    - Check if the result of the MSM is the negation of the point `A` and return success or error based on the result.
- **Output**: Returns `FD_RANGEPROOFS_SUCCESS` if the range proof is valid, otherwise returns `FD_RANGEPROOFS_ERROR`.
- **Functions Called**:
    - [`batched_range_proof_validate_bits`](<#batched_range_proof_validate_bits>)
    - [`fd_rangeproofs_delta`](<#fd_rangeproofs_delta>)
