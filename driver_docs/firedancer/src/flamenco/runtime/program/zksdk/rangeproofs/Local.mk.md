Makefile for adding headers and objects related to range proofs in the Firedancer codebase.

# Purpose
The `Makefile` content defines build instructions for a software project. It uses the `add-hdrs` function to include the header file `fd_rangeproofs.h` in the build process. Additionally, it uses the `add-objs` function to add object files `fd_rangeproofs` and `fd_flamenco` to the build, indicating that these components are part of the compilation process.
