Header file for range proofs, defining constants, data structures, and a verification function.

# Purpose
The code is a C header file that defines structures, constants, and a function prototype for range proofs in a cryptographic context. It includes necessary headers and conditionally includes architecture-specific implementations for AVX512 or a reference implementation. The file defines constants such as `FD_RANGEPROOFS_SUCCESS` and `FD_RANGEPROOFS_ERROR` for indicating the success or failure of operations, and `FD_RANGEPROOFS_MAX_COMMITMENTS` to specify the maximum number of commitments supported.

The file defines several data structures, including `fd_rangeproofs_ipp_vecs_t`, `fd_rangeproofs_range_proof_t`, and `fd_rangeproofs_ipp_proof_t`, which are used to represent various components of range proofs. These structures store cryptographic points and scalars necessary for the proof verification process. The function prototype [`fd_rangeproofs_verify`](<#fd_rangeproofs_verify>) is declared to verify range proofs, taking as input the range proof, inner product proof, commitments, bit lengths, batch length, and a transcript for the verification process. This header file is intended to be included in other C files that implement or utilize range proof verification functionality.

Verifies a range proof using a multi-scalar multiplication.
- **Description**: Use this function to verify a range proof by computing a multi-scalar multiplication (MSM) and checking its result. This function requires valid range and inner product proofs, a set of commitments, bit lengths, and a transcript. The function expects the total bit length to be a power of 2 and less than or equal to 256. It returns a success or error code based on the verification result. Ensure all inputs are correctly initialized and validated before calling this function.
- **Inputs**:
    - `range_proof`: A pointer to a `fd_rangeproofs_range_proof_t` structure containing the range proof data. Must not be null.
    - `ipp_proof`: A pointer to a `fd_rangeproofs_ipp_proof_t` structure containing the inner product proof data. Must not be null.
