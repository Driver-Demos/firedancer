Defines constants and functions for executing and managing an address lookup table program.

# Purpose
This C header file defines constants and function prototypes for managing an address lookup table program within a runtime environment. It includes status definitions for the address lookup table, such as `FD_ADDRLUT_STATUS_ACTIVATED`, `FD_ADDRLUT_STATUS_DEACTIVATING`, and `FD_ADDRLUT_STATUS_DEACTIVATED`, which indicate the current state of the table. The file also defines a constant `FD_LOOKUP_TABLE_META_SIZE` for the metadata size of the lookup table. The function prototypes declared include [`fd_address_lookup_table_program_execute`](<#fd_address_lookup_table_program_execute>), which executes the program with a given execution context, and [`fd_get_active_addresses_len`](<#fd_get_active_addresses_len>), which calculates the number of active addresses based on the current slot and slot hashes. The file uses include guards to prevent multiple inclusions and includes a dependency on `fd_exec_instr_ctx.h` for execution context definitions.

[View Source →](<../../../../../../src/flamenco/runtime/program/fd_address_lookup_table_program.h#L13>)

Executes an address lookup table program instruction.
- **Description**: Use this function to execute an instruction related to the address lookup table program. It checks if the program is migrated to a core BPF and prevents execution if so. The function requires valid instruction data and processes it to perform operations like creating, freezing, extending, deactivating, or closing a lookup table. Call this function when you need to execute a specific instruction within the context of a transaction. Ensure that the instruction data is not null and is within the allowed size limits.
- **Inputs**:
    - `ctx`: A pointer to `fd_exec_instr_ctx_t` which provides the execution context for the instruction. It must not be null and should be properly initialized before calling this function. The context includes transaction context and instruction data.
- **Output**: Returns an integer status code indicating the result of the execution. Possible return values include success, unsupported program ID, or invalid instruction data errors.
- **See Also**: [`fd_address_lookup_table_program_execute`](<fd_address_lookup_table_program.c.md#fd_address_lookup_table_program_execute>)  (Implementation)

### fd\_get\_active\_addresses\_len<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_get_active_addresses_len}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../../src/flamenco/runtime/program/fd_address_lookup_table_program.h#L22>)

Determine the length of active addresses in a lookup table.
- **Description**: Use this function to find the number of active addresses in a given address lookup table. It checks if the table is active for the specified slot and then calculates the active addresses length based on the current slot and the table's metadata. Call this function when you need to know how many addresses are active in the context of a specific slot. Ensure that the `self` parameter points to a valid address lookup table structure and that `active_addresses_len` is a valid pointer to store the result.
- **Inputs**:
    - `self`: A pointer to an `fd_address_lookup_table_t` structure representing the address lookup table. Must not be null.
    - `current_slot`: An unsigned long integer representing the current slot to check against the address lookup table.
    - `slot_hashes`: A pointer to a constant `fd_slot_hash_t` structure. Used to verify if the table is active. Must not be null.
    - `addresses_len`: An unsigned long integer representing the total number of addresses in the table.
    - `active_addresses_len`: A pointer to an unsigned long where the function will store the length of active addresses. Must not be null.
- **Output**: Returns an integer status code. Returns `FD_RUNTIME_EXECUTE_SUCCESS` on success, or `FD_RUNTIME_TXN_ERR_ADDRESS_LOOKUP_TABLE_NOT_FOUND` if the table is not active for the given slot.
- **See Also**: [`fd_get_active_addresses_len`](<fd_address_lookup_table_program.c.md#fd_get_active_addresses_len>)  (Implementation)
