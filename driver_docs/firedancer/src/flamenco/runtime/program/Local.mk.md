Makefile for adding headers and objects for various programs in the Firedancer Flamenco runtime.

# Purpose
The Makefile content defines a build configuration for a software project. It uses conditional statements to include specific headers and object files based on the presence of certain features, such as `FD_HAS_INT128` and `FD_HAS_SECP256K1`. The `add-hdrs` and `add-objs` functions are called to add header files and object files, respectively, to the build process. The configuration is organized into sections for reusable components, precompiled components, and native programs, each specifying the necessary files for compilation. This setup ensures that the build process includes the correct files based on the available features and the intended build targets.
