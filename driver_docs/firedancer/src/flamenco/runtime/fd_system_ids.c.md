Defines public key constants and functions for checking active, pending, and specific reserved keys.

# Purpose
The code defines a set of public keys and their associated identifiers for various system variables and programs within a Solana-based environment. These identifiers are stored in structures of type `fd_pubkey_t`, which encapsulate the public key data. The code includes definitions for system variables such as recent block hashes, clock, slot history, and others, as well as program identifiers for Solana's native loader, feature program, stake program, and more. These identifiers are used to reference specific system components and functionalities within the Solana blockchain.

Additionally, the code implements perfect hash tables to efficiently manage and check the presence of these public keys in two categories: active reserved keys and pending reserved keys. The perfect hash tables are defined using macros and include functions to verify if a given public key is part of the active or pending reserved keys. The code also provides a function to check if a public key corresponds to the `secp256r1` program. This setup allows for quick lookups and validations of public keys against predefined sets of reserved keys, which is essential for maintaining the integrity and security of the system.
