Defines constants for system variable alignment, size, and footprint in the Firedancer runtime.

# Purpose
This code is a C header file that defines constants related to system variables in a runtime environment, likely associated with a blockchain or distributed ledger system. It includes two other header files, `fd_flamenco_base.h` and `fd_funk_base.h`, which suggests dependencies on foundational components of the system. The file defines several constants for different system variables, such as `FD_SYSVAR_CLOCK`, `FD_SYSVAR_EPOCH_REWARDS`, and `FD_SYSVAR_RECENT_HASHES`, specifying their binary code sizes, alignment requirements, and memory footprints. These constants are used to manage memory layout and data alignment for efficient processing of system variables. The file also references specific versions of external resources, indicating alignment with certain versions of a software development kit (SDK).
