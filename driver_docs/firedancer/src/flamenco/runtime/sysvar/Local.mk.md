Makefile configuration for adding headers and objects related to system variables in the Flamenco runtime.

# Purpose
The provided content is a Makefile script that manages the compilation and testing of various system variables (`sysvar`) components in a software project. It uses conditional statements to check for the presence of `FD_HAS_INT128` and `FD_HAS_HOSTED` to determine which parts of the script to execute. The script adds header files and object files for different `sysvar` modules, such as `fd_sysvar_base.h`, `fd_sysvar_cache.h`, and others, using the `add-hdrs` and `add-objs` functions. Additionally, if `FD_HAS_HOSTED` is defined, it includes commands to create and run a unit test named `test_sysvar`, which depends on several components like `fd_flamenco`, `fd_funk`, `fd_ballet`, and `fd_util`. This setup ensures that the necessary files are compiled and tested based on the defined conditions.
