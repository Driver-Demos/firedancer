Calculates the minimum balance for rent exemption based on data length and rent parameters.

# Purpose
The code defines a function [`fd_rent_exempt_minimum_balance`](<#fd_rent_exempt_minimum_balance>) that calculates the minimum balance required for rent exemption in a system, likely related to blockchain or distributed ledger technology. The function takes two parameters: a pointer to a `fd_rent_t` structure and an unsigned long integer `data_len`. The calculation uses the `lamports_per_uint8_year` and `exemption_threshold` fields from the `fd_rent_t` structure, along with a defined constant `ACCOUNT_STORAGE_OVERHEAD`, to compute the minimum balance. The result is cast to an unsigned long integer using the `fd_rust_cast_double_to_ulong` function.

The code is part of a separate compilation unit to reduce dependencies on another module, `fd_funk`. It includes a header file `fd_sysvar_rent.h`, which likely contains the definition of the `fd_rent_t` structure and possibly the `fd_rust_cast_double_to_ulong` function. The code is not an executable but a utility function that can be used in other parts of a program to determine rent exemption requirements. The use of external links in comments suggests that the logic is derived from or related to existing implementations in other programming languages or systems.

[View Source →](<../../../../../../src/flamenco/runtime/sysvar/fd_sysvar_rent1.c#L8>)

Calculates the minimum balance required to be rent-exempt for a given data length.
- **Inputs**:
    - `rent`: A pointer to a `fd_rent_t` structure that contains rent-related parameters such as `lamports_per_uint8_year` and `exemption_threshold`.
    - `data_len`: An unsigned long integer representing the length of the data for which the rent-exempt minimum balance is calculated.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Add `data_len` to the constant `ACCOUNT_STORAGE_OVERHEAD` to account for storage overhead.
    - Multiply the result by `rent->lamports_per_uint8_year` to calculate the annual rent in lamports for the data length.
    - Multiply the result by `rent->exemption_threshold` to determine the rent-exempt threshold.
    - Convert the final result from a double to an unsigned long using `fd_rust_cast_double_to_ulong`.
    - Return the calculated rent-exempt minimum balance.
- **Output**: Returns an unsigned long integer representing the minimum balance required to be rent-exempt for the specified data length.
