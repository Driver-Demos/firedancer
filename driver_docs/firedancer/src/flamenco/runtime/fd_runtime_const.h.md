Defines constants for runtime configuration, including account limits and memory requirements.

# Purpose
This C header file defines several constants used in the Flamenco runtime environment. These constants set upper limits on various system parameters, such as the maximum number of vote accounts (`FD_RUNTIME_MAX_VOTE_ACCOUNTS`), stake accounts (`FD_RUNTIME_MAX_STAKE_ACCOUNTS`), and writable accounts per transaction (`FD_RUNTIME_MAX_WRITABLE_ACCOUNTS_PER_TRANSACTION`). Additionally, it specifies the number of slots per epoch (`FD_RUNTIME_SLOTS_PER_EPOCH`) and the initial block ID hash (`FD_RUNTIME_INITIAL_BLOCK_ID`). The file also includes a constant for the minimum compute units required to execute the stake program (`FD_RUNTIME_MIN_STAKE_INSN_CUS`) and the maximum size of a Solana account (`FD_RUNTIME_ACC_SZ_MAX`). These constants help manage memory allocation and execution costs within the system.
