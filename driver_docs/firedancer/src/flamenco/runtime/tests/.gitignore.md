Specifies files and directories to ignore in version control, including `nanopb_venv/`, `nanopb/`, and `protosol/`.

# Purpose
The directory structure defines three main directories: `nanopb_venv`, `nanopb`, and `protosol`. `nanopb_venv` likely contains a virtual environment for managing dependencies specific to the `nanopb` project. `nanopb` is a directory that may contain files related to the Nanopb library, which is used for Protocol Buffers in embedded systems. `protosol` is a directory that may contain files or scripts related to protocol solutions, possibly involving Protocol Buffers or related serialization tasks.
