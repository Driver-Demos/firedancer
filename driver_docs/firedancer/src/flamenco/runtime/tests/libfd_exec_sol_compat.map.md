Defines versioning and symbol visibility for `sol_compat_*` functions in the Firedancer runtime.

# Purpose
The file defines versioning and symbol visibility rules for a shared library. Under `VER_1`, it specifies that symbols matching the pattern `sol_compat_*` are globally visible, meaning they can be accessed by other programs or libraries. All other symbols are marked as `local`, restricting their visibility to within the library itself.
