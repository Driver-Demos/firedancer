Implements a fuzz testing harness for instruction execution in the Firedancer runtime environment.

# Purpose
The code defines a set of functions for executing and managing fuzz testing of instruction contexts within a Solana-like blockchain environment. The primary function, [`fd_runtime_fuzz_instr_ctx_create`](<#fd_runtime_fuzz_instr_ctx_create>), initializes a transaction instruction context (`fd_exec_instr_ctx_t`) for fuzz testing. It sets up various components such as transaction contexts, bank managers, vote states, blockhash queues, and instruction accounts. The function also ensures that all necessary system variables are present and correctly configured. It handles the allocation and initialization of memory for transaction accounts and executable accounts, and it sets up the instruction context with the necessary data and program identifiers.

The [`fd_runtime_fuzz_instr_ctx_destroy`](<#fd_runtime_fuzz_instr_ctx_destroy>) function is responsible for cleaning up and clearing resources associated with the instruction context after execution. The [`fd_solfuzz_instr_run`](<#fd_solfuzz_instr_run>) function executes the fuzz test by converting input data into an execution context, running the instruction, and capturing the results. It records the effects of the execution, such as modified accounts and return data, and stores them in an output buffer. The code is designed to be part of a larger testing framework, providing a mechanism to test the behavior of transaction instructions under various conditions.

### fd\_runtime\_fuzz\_instr\_ctx\_create<!-- {{#callable:fd_runtime_fuzz_instr_ctx_create}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../../src/flamenco/runtime/tests/fd_instr_harness.c#L18>)

Initializes and sets up the execution context for a fuzzing instruction in a Solana-like environment.
- **Inputs**:
    - `runner`: A pointer to an `fd_solfuzz_runner_t` structure, which manages the execution environment and resources.
    - `ctx`: A pointer to an `fd_exec_instr_ctx_t` structure, which will be initialized and populated with the execution context details.
    - `test_ctx`: A constant pointer to an `fd_exec_test_instr_context_t` structure, which provides the test-specific context and configuration.
    - `is_syscall`: A boolean indicating whether the context creation is for a syscall or not.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Initialize the `ctx` structure to zero using `memset`.
    - Retrieve the `funk` object from the `runner`'s account database.
    - Generate a unique transaction ID (`xid`) for the `funk` transaction.
    - Create a temporary `funk` transaction and attach it to the account database and program cache using `fd_accdb_attach_child` and `fd_progcache_txn_attach_child`.
    - Allocate memory for the transaction context (`txn_ctx`) and join it to the shared memory workspace.
    - Clear the bank state and restore features from `test_ctx` using [`fd_runtime_fuzz_restore_features`](<fd_harness_common.c.md#fd_runtime_fuzz_restore_features>).
    - Set up vote state accounts and handle errors if any of the state joins fail.
    - Initialize the blockhash queue with a secure random seed.
    - Set up a mock transaction descriptor and allocate scratch space for the program cache.
    - Configure the transaction context with compute budget details and enable VM tracing if specified.
    - Allocate and initialize an instruction information structure (`info`).
    - Prepare and load accounts into the transaction context, handling account metadata and mutability.
    - Ensure the program ID is present in the accounts list, adding it if necessary.
    - Load executable accounts and handle BPF loader state for upgradeable programs.
    - Set slot bank variables and ensure all relevant system variables (sysvars) are present.
    - Override epoch bank rent settings and recent blockhash if provided.
    - Load instruction accounts and set up instruction account details.
    - Check for the presence of the program ID in the accounts list and handle errors if not found.
    - Refresh the transaction context setup with updated slot and epoch context.
    - Initialize the log collector and encode the program ID in base58 format.
    - Return 1 to indicate successful context creation.
- **Output**: Returns 1 on successful context creation, or 0 if an error occurs during setup.
- **Functions Called**:
    - [`fd_runtime_fuzz_restore_features`](<fd_harness_common.c.md#fd_runtime_fuzz_restore_features>)
    - [`fd_runtime_fuzz_load_account`](<fd_harness_common.c.md#fd_runtime_fuzz_load_account>)

### fd\_runtime\_fuzz\_instr\_ctx\_destroy<!-- {{#callable:fd_runtime_fuzz_instr_ctx_destroy}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../../src/flamenco/runtime/tests/fd_instr_harness.c#L328>)

Releases resources associated with an instruction context in a fuzzing environment.
- **Inputs**:
    - ``runner``: A pointer to an `fd_solfuzz_runner_t` structure, which manages the fuzzing environment.
    - ``ctx``: A pointer to an `fd_exec_instr_ctx_t` structure, representing the instruction context to be destroyed.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Check if `ctx` is NULL; if it is, return immediately without doing anything.
    - Call `fd_accdb_clear` with `runner->accdb_admin` to clear the account database administration resources.
    - Call `fd_progcache_clear` with `runner->progcache_admin` to clear the program cache administration resources.
- **Output**: No output is returned as the function has a void return type.

### fd\_solfuzz\_instr\_run<!-- {{#callable:fd_solfuzz_instr_run}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../../src/flamenco/runtime/tests/fd_instr_harness.c#L336>)

Executes a test instruction in a fuzzing environment and captures its effects.
- **Inputs**:
    - `runner`: A pointer to `fd_solfuzz_runner_t`, which manages the fuzzing execution context.
    - `input_`: A constant pointer to the input data, which is a `fd_exec_test_instr_context_t` structure.
    - `output_`: A pointer to a pointer where the function will store the address of the output effects.
    - `output_buf`: A pointer to a buffer where the function can store output data.
    - `output_bufsz`: The size of the `output_buf` in bytes.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Convert the Protobuf input to an execution context using [`fd_runtime_fuzz_instr_ctx_create`](<#fd_runtime_fuzz_instr_ctx_create>).
    - Execute the instruction using `fd_execute_instr`.
    - Initialize scratch space for output data allocation.
    - Allocate and initialize `fd_exec_test_instr_effects_t` to capture the execution result and compute budget details.
    - Check if the program is a precompile and capture custom error codes if applicable.
    - Allocate space for modified accounts and capture their states.
    - Iterate over accounts to capture borrowed account details, including address, lamports, data, and owner.
    - Capture return data if available.
    - Finalize the scratch allocation and destroy the execution context.
- **Output**: Returns the number of bytes used in the `output_buf` to store the effects, or 0 if an error occurs.
- **Functions Called**:
    - [`fd_runtime_fuzz_instr_ctx_create`](<#fd_runtime_fuzz_instr_ctx_create>)
    - [`fd_runtime_fuzz_instr_ctx_destroy`](<#fd_runtime_fuzz_instr_ctx_destroy>)
