Automates nightly code updates, environment setup, and backtest execution with Slack notifications.

# Purpose
This script is a Bash executable designed to automate the process of updating a code repository, setting up the environment, and running a series of tests. It begins by navigating to a specified directory and updating the repository to the latest commit on a specified branch. The script then configures the environment by adjusting the `PATH` and `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` variables and performs a clean build setup. It installs necessary dependencies using a custom script and prepares the environment for running tests. The script executes a set of backtest tests and captures the exit status. Based on the test results, it sends a notification message to a Slack channel using a webhook URL, indicating whether the tests passed or failed.
