Bash script to set up a virtual environment, install dependencies, and fetch specific versions of nanopb and protosol.

# Purpose
This script is a Bash executable that sets up a development environment for working with Protocol Buffers and the nanopb library. It begins by setting a default version for Protocol Buffers, which can be overridden by an environment variable. The script then creates a Python virtual environment using Python 3.11 and installs necessary packages such as `protobuf` and `grpcio-tools`. It proceeds to clone the nanopb repository and checks out a specific tag defined in a file located in a relative path. Additionally, it clones the protosol repository at a specified version or branch. Finally, the script uses the nanopb generator to process `.proto` files located in the protosol directory, generating output in a specified directory.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `python3.11`
- `pip`
- `protobuf`
- `grpcio-tools`
- `git`


# Global Variables

---
### PROTO\_VERSION
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: Specifies the version of the protocol to use when fetching the `protosol` repository. It defaults to 'v1.0.5' if not overridden by an environment variable.
- **Use**: Used to determine which version of the `protosol` repository to clone or checkout.


---
### SCRIPT\_DIR
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: Contains the absolute path to the directory where the script is located. It is determined by changing to the directory of the script and then using the `pwd` command to get the current directory path.
- **Use**: Used to reference the script's directory path for operations that require knowledge of the script's location.


---
### FD\_NANOPB\_TAG
- **Type**: ``string``
- **Description**: The `FD_NANOPB_TAG` variable is a string that stores the content of the file located at `../../../ballet/nanopb/nanopb_tag.txt`. This file is expected to contain a specific tag or version identifier for the `nanopb` repository.
- **Use**: Used to specify the tag or version of the `nanopb` repository to fetch and checkout in the script.
