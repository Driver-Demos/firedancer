Shell script to run multiple ledger backtests on different networks and configurations.

# Purpose
This script is a Bash executable that automates the execution of a series of ledger backtests using the `run_ledger_backtest.sh` script located in the `src/flamenco/runtime/tests` directory. Each line in the script calls the backtest script with specific parameters, such as the ledger identifier (`-l`), the number of years (`-y`), the maximum number of transactions (`-m`), the end epoch (`-e`), and the version of the code (`-c`). The script is designed to test different network environments, including mainnet, devnet, and testnet, with various configurations and conditions. The script uses the `set -e` command to ensure that it stops execution if any command fails, which helps maintain the integrity of the testing process.
