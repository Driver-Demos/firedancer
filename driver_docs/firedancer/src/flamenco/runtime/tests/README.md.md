Documentation for the Firedancer SVM backend integration with solfuzz, detailing its layered architecture.

# Purpose
The document describes the integration of the Firedancer SVM backend with the `solfuzz` tool, which wraps the Solana runtime (SVM) in a Protobuf format. This integration allows users to execute inputs against various SVM implementations, including Agave, Firedancer, Mithril, and Sig. The integration is structured in three layers: `sol_compat`, `fd_solfuzz`, and `fd_runtime`. The `sol_compat` layer provides a stable C API for external users, outputting a shared library `libfd_exec_sol_compat.so`. The `fd_solfuzz` layer, which is not a stable API, uses Protobuf formats and is mainly for internal use, supporting advanced features for command-line tools and tests. The `fd_runtime` layer represents the actual Firedancer SVM implementation.
