Makefile for building and testing components in the Flamenco runtime with SECP256K1 support.

# Purpose
The content is a Makefile script used to manage the build process for a software project. It includes conditional compilation directives `ifdef FD_HAS_INT128` and `ifdef FD_HAS_SECP256K1` to check for specific features or dependencies before executing the build commands. The script uses `$(call add-hdrs,...)` and `$(call add-objs,...)` to add header files and object files to the build process, respectively. It defines `SOL_COMPAT_FLAGS` to specify linker flags for compatibility with the Solana ecosystem. The script also includes commands to create unit tests and shared libraries using `$(call make-unit-test,...)` and `$(call make-shared,...)`. Finally, it defines a target `run-runtime-backtest` to execute a backtest script, which is part of the project's testing suite.
