Internal/unstable APIs for executing solfuzz inputs with object-oriented design and multi-thread support.

# Purpose
The `fd_solfuzz.h` file defines internal and unstable APIs for executing solfuzz inputs. It is designed to be object-oriented and does not use global variables, except for a registered `fd_shmem` region. The file provides functionality for custom memory workspace setups, multi-threaded use, and multi-session use. It includes several header files from different modules, such as `fd_solcap_writer.h`, `fd_accdb_admin.h`, `fd_accdb_user.h`, `fd_progcache_admin.h`, and `fd_progcache_user.h`, indicating that it interacts with components related to capture, account database, and program cache management.

The primary component defined in this file is the `fd_solfuzz_runner_t` structure, which processes solfuzz inputs. This structure can be reused for different inputs and supports single-threaded operation per object, while allowing multiple threads to use different objects. The `fd_solfuzz_runner_t` structure holds shared mutable references to a workspace and can share this workspace with other solfuzz runner objects. The file also defines a set of functions for creating, deleting, and managing solfuzz runner objects, as well as executing various types of tests, such as instruction execution, transaction execution, block execution, program loading, syscall handling, and bytecode execution. These functions facilitate the execution of Protobuf test inputs and outputs, and they include methods for checking memory leaks and managing demand-paged workspaces.
