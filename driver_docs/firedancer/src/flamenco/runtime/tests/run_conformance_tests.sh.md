A script to run Solana conformance tests, setting up dependencies and executing tests with specified inputs.

# Purpose
The `run_conformance_tests.sh` script is a Bash script designed to execute conformance tests for the Solana blockchain using specified test inputs. It sets up the necessary dependencies by cloning and configuring the required repositories, such as `firedancer`, `solfuzz-agave`, and `solana-conformance`, and checks out the specified branches. The script accepts various command-line arguments to customize the test environment, including directories for test inputs, run locations, and output storage, as well as repository paths and branches. It ensures that all required directories and dependencies are in place before running the tests and outputs the results to a specified directory.
# Global Variables

---
### RUN\_DIRECTORY
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: Specifies the default directory where the conformance tests will be executed. It is initialized with the path '/data/conformance_tests'.
- **Use**: Used to determine the directory for running tests and storing related files.


---
### FIREDANCER\_BRANCH
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: Specifies the branch of the Firedancer repository to use for the conformance tests. It is set to 'main' by default, but can be overridden by the '-fdb' or '--firedancer-branch' command-line argument.
- **Use**: Used to determine which branch of the Firedancer repository is checked out during the setup process for running conformance tests.


---
### AGAVE\_BRANCH
- **Type**: ``string``
- **Description**: The `AGAVE_BRANCH` variable is a global string variable that specifies the branch of the `solfuzz-agave` repository to use. It is initialized with the default value `agave-v2.0`. This variable can be overridden by the `-ab` or `--agave-branch` command-line argument.
- **Use**: Specifies the branch of the `solfuzz-agave` repository to check out during the script execution.


---
### SOLANA\_CONFORMANCE\_BRANCH
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: Specifies the branch of the `solana-conformance` repository to use for running conformance tests. It is set to a default value of 'main' but can be overridden by a command-line argument.
- **Use**: Used to determine which branch of the `solana-conformance` repository to check out and use during the setup of the conformance test environment.


---
### FIREDANCER\_REPO
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: The `FIREDANCER_REPO` variable stores the path to the Firedancer repository. It is set based on the command-line argument `-fdr` or defaults to a directory within `RUN_DIRECTORY` if not specified.
- **Use**: Stores the path to the Firedancer repository for use in the script's operations.


---
### AGAVE\_REPO
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: The `AGAVE_REPO` variable stores the path to the Solfuzz-Agave repository. It is set based on the command-line argument `-ar` or defaults to a directory within `RUN_DIRECTORY` if not provided.
- **Use**: Used to navigate to the Solfuzz-Agave repository directory for setup and build operations.


---
### SOLANA\_CONFORMANCE\_REPO
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: The `SOLANA_CONFORMANCE_REPO` variable stores the path to the local directory where the Solana conformance repository is cloned. If not specified by the user, it defaults to a directory named `solana-conformance` within the `RUN_DIRECTORY`. This variable is used to navigate to the Solana conformance repository for setup and execution of tests.
- **Use**: Stores the path to the Solana conformance repository for test setup and execution.


---
### TEST\_INPUTS
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: The `TEST_INPUTS` variable is a string that stores the directory path containing the test inputs for the conformance tests. It is a required argument for the script to run properly.
- **Use**: Stores the directory path for test inputs used in the conformance tests.


---
### OUTPUT\_DIR
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: Specifies the directory where the test results will be stored. If not provided by the user, it defaults to the 'test_results' directory within the 'RUN_DIRECTORY'. This variable is set based on the '-o' or '--output-dir' command-line argument.
- **Use**: Stores the path for saving test results after running the conformance tests.


---
### PATH
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: `PATH` is a global environment variable that specifies a list of directories where the system looks for executable files. It is used to locate the binaries for commands and scripts that are executed in the shell.
- **Use**: Modifies the system's search path to include the directory `/opt/rh/gcc-toolset-12/root/usr/bin` at the beginning of the existing `PATH` variable.


---
### PKG\_CONFIG\_PATH
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` is a string variable that specifies the directory paths where the system should look for package configuration files. It is used to locate `.pc` files, which contain metadata about installed libraries.
- **Use**: Used to set the search path for package configuration files during the setup of the `firedancer` project.
