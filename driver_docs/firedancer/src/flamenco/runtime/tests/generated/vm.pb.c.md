Automatically generated nanopb constant definitions for various test structures in the Firedancer codebase.

# Purpose
This code is an automatically generated C source file that defines constant bindings for Protocol Buffers (protobuf) using the nanopb library. It includes the header file `vm.pb.h` and checks the `PB_PROTO_HEADER_VERSION` to ensure compatibility with the nanopb generator version 0.4.9.1. The file uses the `PB_BIND` macro to bind various data structures, such as `fd_exec_test_input_data_region_t`, `fd_exec_test_vm_context_t`, and others, to their corresponding protobuf message types. These bindings facilitate the serialization and deserialization of data structures for communication or storage purposes in applications that use Protocol Buffers.
