Defines nanopb-generated structures and initializers for testing execution types in the Solana Sealevel runtime.

# Purpose
This code is a C header file generated by the nanopb tool, version 0.4.9.1. It defines data structures and associated metadata for protocol buffer messages used in the context of the Solana Sealevel virtual machine. The file includes type definitions for three main structures: `fd_exec_test_type_context_t`, `fd_exec_test_type_effects_t`, and `fd_exec_test_type_fixture_t`. These structures are used to represent the context, effects, and fixture of an execution test, respectively. Each structure contains fields that are either pointers to byte arrays or other data types, and they are used to store serialized data and metadata.

The header file also provides macros for initializing these structures with default or zero values, as well as field tags for manual encoding and decoding. It includes conditional compilation checks to ensure compatibility with the correct version of the nanopb generator. Additionally, the file maps canonical names to the defined structures and provides backward compatibility with older versions of nanopb. The header is intended to be included in other C source files that require these protocol buffer definitions for encoding and decoding data in a structured format.

# Data Structures

---
### fd\_exec\_test\_type\_context\_t
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `content`: A pointer to a `pb_bytes_array_t` structure that holds byte array data.
    - `typename`: A `pb_callback_t` structure that manages a callback for handling string data.
- **Description**: Represents a context for executing test types, containing a byte array and a callback for string handling.


---
### fd\_exec\_test\_type\_effects\_t
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `result`: Stores a 64-bit unsigned integer result.
    - `representation`: Points to a `pb_bytes_array_t` that holds a byte array representation.
    - `yaml`: Points to a `pb_bytes_array_t` that holds a YAML byte array.
- **Description**: Defines a structure that holds the result of an execution test as a 64-bit unsigned integer, along with two pointers to byte arrays for representation and YAML data.


---
### fd\_exec\_test\_type\_fixture\_t
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `has_metadata`: Indicates if metadata is present.
    - `metadata`: Stores metadata information using `fd_exec_test_fixture_metadata_t`.
    - `has_input`: Indicates if input data is present.
    - `input`: Stores input data using `fd_exec_test_type_context_t`.
    - `has_output`: Indicates if output data is present.
    - `output`: Stores output data using `fd_exec_test_type_effects_t`.
- **Description**: Defines a fixture for executing tests, containing optional metadata, input, and output fields, each with a corresponding boolean flag to indicate presence.
