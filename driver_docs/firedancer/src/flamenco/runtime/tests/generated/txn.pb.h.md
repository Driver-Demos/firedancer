Defines data structures and initialization macros for transaction processing in a nanopb-generated header.

# Purpose
The code is a C header file generated by the nanopb library, which is used for encoding and decoding Protocol Buffers in C. This file defines data structures and constants for handling transaction-related messages in the Solana blockchain environment. The primary purpose of this file is to provide a structured way to represent and manipulate transaction data, including message headers, compiled instructions, address table lookups, transaction messages, sanitized transactions, transaction contexts, resulting states, rent debits, fee details, transaction results, and transaction fixtures.

Each structure in the file corresponds to a specific aspect of a transaction, such as the `fd_exec_test_transaction_message_t` which contains the transaction data, including account keys, recent blockhash, and instructions. The file also includes initializer macros for these structures, ensuring they can be initialized with default or zero values. Additionally, the file defines field tags and encoding specifications for use with nanopb, facilitating the serialization and deserialization of these structures. The header file is intended to be included in other C source files that require access to these transaction-related data structures and their associated functionalities.
