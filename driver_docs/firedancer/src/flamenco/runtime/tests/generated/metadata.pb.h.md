Automatically generated nanopb header for defining and initializing fixture metadata structures.

# Purpose
The code is a C header file generated by the nanopb tool, version 0.4.9.1, which is used for Protocol Buffers in embedded systems. This file defines the structure and metadata for a message type related to the Solana Sealevel project, specifically for test fixture metadata. The primary structure defined is `fd_exec_test_fixture_metadata_t`, which includes a single character array field `fn_entrypoint` with a maximum length of 129 characters. This field is intended to store the entry point function name for a test fixture.

The header file includes several macros and definitions to facilitate the use of this structure with nanopb's encoding and decoding functions. It provides initializer macros for setting default and zero values for the structure, as well as field tags and encoding specifications for manual encoding or decoding. The file also includes compatibility definitions for older versions of nanopb and specifies the maximum encoded size of the message. The use of `extern "C"` indicates that the file is compatible with C++ compilers, ensuring that the C linkage is used for the defined symbols.
