Nanopb-generated header for Solana Sealevel serialization with struct definitions and field tags.

# Purpose
This code is a C header file generated by the nanopb library, version 0.4.9.1, which is used for encoding and decoding Protocol Buffers (protobuf) in C. The file defines data structures and associated metadata for serializing and deserializing messages related to the Solana Sealevel virtual machine. It includes two main structures: `org_solana_sealevel_v1_vm_mem_region_t` and `org_solana_sealevel_v1_instr_serialize_result_t`. The first structure represents a memory region in the virtual machine, with fields for the virtual memory address, content, and a flag indicating if the region is writable. The second structure represents the result of an instruction serialization, containing a result code and a list of memory regions.

The header file also provides macros for initializing these structures with default or zero values, as well as field tags for manual encoding and decoding. It specifies the encoding specifications for each field using nanopb's callback mechanism, which allows for custom handling of fields during serialization. The file includes compatibility definitions for older versions of nanopb and declares external message descriptors for use in encoding and decoding operations. The header is designed to be included in C or C++ projects, as indicated by the `extern "C"` block, which ensures compatibility with C++ compilers.
# Data Structures

---
### org\_solana\_sealevel\_v1\_vm\_mem\_region\_t
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `vm_addr`: A 64-bit unsigned integer that represents the virtual memory address.
    - `content`: A `pb_callback_t` type that represents the content of the memory region, using a callback mechanism.
    - `is_writable`: A boolean value that indicates if the memory region is writable.
- **Description**: Defines a memory region in a virtual machine environment, with fields for the virtual memory address, the content of the memory region, and a flag to indicate if the region is writable.


---
### org\_solana\_sealevel\_v1\_instr\_serialize\_result\_t
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - ``result``: Stores the result of the serialization process as a 32-bit integer.
    - ``regions``: Holds a callback for handling repeated memory regions, defined as `pb_callback_t`.
- **Description**: Represents the result of a serialization operation, including a status code and a callback for processing memory regions.
