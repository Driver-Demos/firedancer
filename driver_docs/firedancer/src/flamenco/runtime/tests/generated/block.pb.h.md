Defines data structures and initialization values for block execution tests using nanopb in the Firedancer codebase.

# Purpose
The code is a C header file generated by the nanopb tool, which is used for encoding and decoding Protocol Buffers in C. This file defines several data structures and associated metadata for handling blockchain-related data in the Solana Sealevel environment. The primary structures include `fd_exec_test_cost_tracker_t`, `fd_exec_test_block_context_t`, `fd_exec_test_leader_schedule_effects_t`, `fd_exec_test_block_effects_t`, and `fd_exec_test_block_fixture_t`. These structures are used to represent various aspects of blockchain execution, such as transaction costs, block contexts, leader schedules, and block effects.

The header file includes definitions for initializing these structures with default and zero values, as well as field tags for manual encoding and decoding. It also provides message descriptors for each structure, which are used by nanopb to handle Protocol Buffers serialization. The file includes conditional compilation checks to ensure compatibility with the correct version of the nanopb generator. Additionally, it includes mappings for backward compatibility with previous versions of the nanopb library. The file is intended to be included in other C source files that require these data structures for blockchain processing and testing within the Solana Sealevel framework.

# Data Structures

---
### fd\_exec\_test\_cost\_tracker\_t
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `block_cost`: Represents the cost associated with a block.
    - `vote_cost`: Represents the cost associated with a vote.
- **Description**: Tracks the costs related to block and vote operations, using two 64-bit unsigned integers to store the respective costs.


---
### fd\_exec\_test\_block\_context\_t
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `txns_count`: Indicates the number of transactions in the microblock.
    - `txns`: Points to an array of sanitized transactions.
    - `acct_states_count`: Indicates the number of input account states.
    - `acct_states`: Points to an array of account states.
    - `blockhash_queue_count`: Indicates the number of blockhashes in the queue.
    - `blockhash_queue`: Points to an array of blockhash queues.
    - `has_slot_ctx`: Indicates if the slot context is present.
    - `slot_ctx`: Contains the slot context information.
    - `has_epoch_ctx`: Indicates if the epoch context is present.
    - `epoch_ctx`: Contains the epoch context information.
- **Description**: Represents the context of a block execution test, including transactions, account states, blockhash queue, and optional slot and epoch contexts.


---
### fd\_exec\_test\_leader\_schedule\_effects\_t
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `leaders_epoch`: Epoch number for which this leader schedule applies.
    - `leaders_slot0`: First slot number covered by this leader schedule.
    - `leaders_slot_cnt`: Total number of slots covered by this leader schedule.
    - `leader_pub_cnt`: Number of unique validator public keys in the leader schedule.
    - `leaders_sched_cnt`: Number of entries in the leader schedule (slots with assigned leaders).
    - `leader_schedule_hash`: Hash of the leader schedule.
- **Description**: Defines the structure for storing information about a leader schedule, including the epoch, slot range, number of unique validators, number of scheduled slots, and a hash of the schedule.


---
### fd\_exec\_test\_block\_effects\_t
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `has_error`: Indicates if block execution failed.
    - `slot_capitalization`: Represents the slot capitalization as a 64-bit unsigned integer.
    - `bank_hash`: Stores the bank hash as an array of 32 bytes.
    - `has_cost_tracker`: Indicates if the cost tracker is present.
    - `cost_tracker`: Holds the cost tracker data using `fd_exec_test_cost_tracker_t`.
    - `has_leader_schedule`: Indicates if the leader schedule is present.
    - `leader_schedule`: Holds the leader schedule data using `fd_exec_test_leader_schedule_effects_t`.
- **Description**: `fd_exec_test_block_effects_t` is a structure that encapsulates the effects of executing a block, including error status, slot capitalization, bank hash, and optional components such as cost tracker and leader schedule. It uses boolean flags to indicate the presence of optional components and includes nested structures for detailed tracking of costs and leader scheduling effects.


---
### fd\_exec\_test\_block\_fixture\_t
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `has_metadata`: Indicates if metadata is present.
    - `metadata`: Holds the metadata information.
    - `has_input`: Indicates if input data is present.
    - `input`: Contains the block input context.
    - `has_output`: Indicates if output data is present.
    - `output`: Contains the block output effects.
- **Description**: Represents a test block fixture that includes optional metadata, input context, and output effects for block execution testing.
