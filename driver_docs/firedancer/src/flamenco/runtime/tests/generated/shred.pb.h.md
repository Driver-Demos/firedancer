Defines nanopb-generated structures and constants for testing shred parsing in the Firedancer codebase.

# Purpose
The code is a C header file generated by the nanopb tool, version 0.4.9.1, which is used for encoding and decoding Protocol Buffers in C. This file defines several data structures and associated metadata for handling "shreds" in the context of the Solana blockchain's sealevel runtime. The primary structures include `fd_exec_test_shred_binary_t`, `fd_exec_test_data_header_t`, `fd_exec_test_code_header_t`, `fd_exec_test_parsed_shred_t`, and `fd_exec_test_accepts_shred_t`. These structures are used to represent different components of a shred, such as raw binary data, data headers, code headers, parsed shreds, and the acceptance status of a shred.

The file also includes macros for initializing these structures with default or zero values, as well as field tags and encoding specifications for use with nanopb's encoding and decoding functions. The header ensures compatibility with a specific version of the nanopb protocol header and provides backward compatibility with code written before nanopb version 0.4.0. Additionally, the file includes conditional compilation directives to ensure it is only included once and provides C++ compatibility through the use of `extern "C"`.

# Data Structures

---
### fd\_exec\_test\_shred\_binary\_t
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `data`: Pointer to a `pb_bytes_array_t` structure that holds raw byte data.
- **Description**: Represents a structure that contains a pointer to raw byte data, used for testing shred parsing in the context of the Solana Sealevel virtual machine.


---
### fd\_exec\_test\_data\_header\_t
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `parent_off`: Stores the offset of the parent data.
    - `flags`: Holds flags that provide additional information about the data.
    - `size`: Indicates the size of the data.
- **Description**: Defines a header structure for test data with fields for parent offset, flags, and size, used in parsing and processing operations.


---
### fd\_exec\_test\_code\_header\_t
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `data_cnt`: Stores the count of data elements.
    - `code_cnt`: Stores the count of code elements.
    - `idx`: Stores an index value.
- **Description**: Defines a structure to hold metadata for code headers, including counts of data and code elements, and an index value.


---
### fd\_exec\_test\_parsed\_shred\_t
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `signature`: A callback function for handling the signature.
    - `variant`: An unsigned 32-bit integer representing the variant of the shred.
    - `slot`: An unsigned 64-bit integer representing the slot number.
    - `idx`: An unsigned 32-bit integer representing the index of the shred.
    - `version`: An unsigned 32-bit integer representing the version of the shred.
    - `fec_set_idx`: An unsigned 32-bit integer representing the FEC set index.
    - `which_shred_type`: A size type indicating which type of shred is used.
    - `shred_type`: A union containing either a data header or a code header.
- **Description**: Represents a parsed shred with various attributes such as signature, variant, slot, index, version, and FEC set index, and includes a union to differentiate between data and code headers.


---
### fd\_exec\_test\_accepts\_shred\_t
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `valid`: Indicates if the shred is accepted after parsing.
- **Description**: Represents the acceptance status of a shred after parsing, with a single boolean member `valid` to indicate whether the shred is accepted or not.
