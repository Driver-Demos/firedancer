Defines data structures and initialization values for Solana's context, account, and inflation models.

# Purpose
The code is a C header file generated by the nanopb tool, which is used for encoding and decoding Protocol Buffers in C. This file defines data structures and associated metadata for handling various components related to the Solana blockchain's execution context. The primary structures include `fd_exec_test_feature_set_t`, `fd_exec_test_acct_state_t`, `fd_exec_test_vote_account_t`, `fd_exec_test_inflation_t`, `fd_exec_test_fee_rate_governor_t`, `fd_exec_test_epoch_context_t`, and `fd_exec_test_slot_context_t`. These structures represent different aspects of the blockchain's state, such as account states, vote accounts, inflation parameters, fee rate governance, and context information for epochs and slots.

The file also includes macros for initializing these structures with default and zero values, as well as field tags and encoding specifications for use with nanopb. The header ensures compatibility with a specific version of the nanopb generator and provides a mechanism for backward compatibility with older code. The file is intended to be included in other C source files that require access to these data structures and their associated Protocol Buffers encoding and decoding capabilities. The header file does not define any public APIs or external interfaces directly but provides the necessary definitions for working with the Solana blockchain's execution context in a C environment.

### fd\_exec\_test\_feature\_set\_t
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `features_count`: Indicates the number of enabled features.
    - `features`: Points to an array of 64-bit integers, each representing the first 8 bytes of a feature ID in little-endian format.
- **Description**: Represents a set of feature flags, where each feature is identified by the first 8 bytes of its ID stored as a little-endian integer. The `features_count` member specifies how many features are enabled, and the `features` pointer references the array containing these feature identifiers.


---
### fd\_exec\_test\_acct\_state\_t
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `address`: A 32-byte array that stores the account address.
    - `lamports`: A 64-bit unsigned integer that represents the number of lamports in the account.
    - `data`: A pointer to a `pb_bytes_array_t` that holds the account data, limited to 10 MiB on Solana mainnet.
    - `executable`: A boolean that indicates if the account is executable.
    - `owner`: A 32-byte array that stores the address of the program that owns the account.
- **Description**: Represents the complete state of an account on the Solana blockchain, excluding its public key. It includes the account's address, balance in lamports, associated data, executability status, and the owner's address. The structure is designed to encapsulate all necessary information about an account for operations within the Solana network.


---
### fd\_exec\_test\_vote\_account\_t
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `has_vote_account`: Indicates if the vote account is present.
    - `vote_account`: Holds the state of the vote account using `fd_exec_test_acct_state_t`.
    - `stake`: Represents the amount of stake delegated to this account.
- **Description**: Manages the state and stake information of a vote account, including whether the account exists, its detailed state, and the amount of stake delegated to it.


---
### fd\_exec\_test\_inflation\_t
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `initial`: Represents the initial inflation rate as a double.
    - `terminal`: Represents the terminal inflation rate as a double.
    - `taper`: Represents the tapering factor for inflation as a double.
    - `foundation`: Represents the foundation's share of inflation as a double.
    - `foundation_term`: Represents the term for the foundation's share of inflation as a double.
- **Description**: Defines the parameters for inflation within an epoch bank, including initial and terminal rates, tapering, and foundation shares, all represented as double precision floating-point numbers.


---
### fd\_exec\_test\_fee\_rate\_governor\_t
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `target_lamports_per_signature`: Specifies the target number of lamports per signature.
    - `target_signatures_per_slot`: Specifies the target number of signatures per slot.
    - `min_lamports_per_signature`: Specifies the minimum number of lamports per signature.
    - `max_lamports_per_signature`: Specifies the maximum number of lamports per signature.
    - `burn_percent`: Specifies the percentage of lamports to burn.
- **Description**: Defines parameters for governing fee rates, including target, minimum, and maximum lamports per signature, as well as the target number of signatures per slot and the percentage of lamports to burn.


---
### fd\_exec\_test\_epoch\_context\_t
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `has_features`: Indicates if the feature set is active.
    - `features`: Stores the active feature set as a `fd_exec_test_feature_set_t`.
    - `hashes_per_tick`: Specifies the number of hashes computed per tick.
    - `ticks_per_slot`: Specifies the number of ticks in each slot.
    - `slots_per_year`: Represents the number of slots in a year.
    - `has_inflation`: Indicates if inflation parameters are active.
    - `inflation`: Stores inflation parameters as a `fd_exec_test_inflation_t`.
    - `genesis_creation_time`: Records the creation time of the genesis block.
    - `vote_accounts_t_1_count`: Counts the number of vote accounts for epoch T-1.
    - `vote_accounts_t_1`: Points to the vote accounts for epoch T-1.
    - `vote_accounts_t_2_count`: Counts the number of vote accounts for epoch T-2.
    - `vote_accounts_t_2`: Points to the vote accounts for epoch T-2.
- **Description**: Represents the context of an epoch in a blockchain system, including feature sets, inflation parameters, and vote accounts for the two previous epochs. It provides essential data for managing and understanding the state of the blockchain at a given epoch, such as the number of hashes per tick, ticks per slot, and slots per year, as well as the genesis creation time.
