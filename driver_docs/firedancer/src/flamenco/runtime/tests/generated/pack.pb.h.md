Defines nanopb-generated structures and initializers for Solana Sealevel compute budget testing.

# Purpose
The code is a C header file generated by the nanopb tool, which is used for encoding and decoding Protocol Buffers in C. This file defines data structures and constants for handling messages related to compute budget operations in the Solana Sealevel runtime environment. The file includes several `typedef` structures such as `fd_exec_test_pack_compute_budget_context_t`, `fd_exec_test_pack_compute_budget_effects_t`, and `fd_exec_test_pack_compute_budget_fixture_t`. These structures represent different aspects of compute budget testing, including context, effects, and fixtures.

The header file also defines initialization macros for these structures, which provide default and zero-initialized values. Additionally, it specifies field tags and encoding specifications for each structure, which are used in the manual encoding and decoding of Protocol Buffer messages. The file includes compatibility definitions for older versions of nanopb and maps canonical names to internal representations. The header ensures that the correct version of the nanopb generator is used by checking the `PB_PROTO_HEADER_VERSION`. This file is intended to be included in other C source files that require these data structures and constants for handling compute budget-related Protocol Buffer messages.
