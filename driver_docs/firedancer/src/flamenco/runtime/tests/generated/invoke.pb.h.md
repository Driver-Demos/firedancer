Defines nanopb message structures and initialization macros for testing program instruction execution.

# Purpose
The code is a C header file generated by the nanopb tool, which is used for encoding and decoding Protocol Buffers in C. This file defines data structures and constants for handling program invocation instructions within the Solana blockchain's Sealevel runtime environment. The primary purpose of this file is to facilitate the serialization and deserialization of data related to instruction execution, including the context, effects, and fixtures of these instructions.

The file includes several `typedef` structures such as `fd_exec_test_instr_acct_t`, `fd_exec_test_instr_context_t`, `fd_exec_test_instr_effects_t`, and `fd_exec_test_instr_fixture_t`. These structures represent different aspects of instruction execution, such as account information, execution context, execution results, and test fixtures. The file also defines macros for initializing these structures with default or zero values, as well as field tags for manual encoding and decoding. The header ensures compatibility with a specific version of the nanopb generator and includes necessary dependencies from other Protocol Buffer files. The file is intended to be included in other C source files that require these definitions for processing Solana Sealevel instructions.

# Data Structures

---
### fd\_exec\_test\_instr\_acct\_t
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `index`: Selects an account in an external list.
    - `is_writable`: Indicates if the account is writable.
    - `is_signer`: Indicates if the account is a signer.
- **Description**: Defines an account in an external list with attributes to specify if it is writable and if it is a signer.


---
### fd\_exec\_test\_instr\_context\_t
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `program_id`: A 32-byte array that stores the address of the invoked program.
    - `accounts_count`: Stores the number of account states accessed by the instruction.
    - `accounts`: A pointer to an array of `fd_exec_test_acct_state` structures representing account states.
    - `instr_accounts_count`: Stores the number of account accesses for the instruction.
    - `instr_accounts`: A pointer to an array of `fd_exec_test_instr_acct` structures representing account access lists.
    - `data`: A pointer to a `pb_bytes_array_t` structure containing input data for program execution.
    - `cu_avail`: Stores the available compute units for the instruction.
    - `has_slot_context`: Indicates if the slot context is present.
    - `slot_context`: Stores the slot context information in a `fd_exec_test_slot_context_t` structure.
    - `has_epoch_context`: Indicates if the epoch context is present.
    - `epoch_context`: Stores the epoch context information in a `fd_exec_test_epoch_context_t` structure.
- **Description**: Contains all necessary information to independently replay a program invocation, including program address, account states, input data, and optional slot and epoch contexts. It is used to manage and execute instructions within a transaction, ensuring that all required data and contexts are available for execution.


---
### fd\_exec\_test\_instr\_effects\_t
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `result`: Stores the result of the instruction execution, with zero indicating success and non-zero indicating an error.
    - `custom_err`: Holds a custom error code for certain error cases, stable across clients.
    - `modified_accounts_count`: Indicates the number of accounts that were modified during execution.
    - `modified_accounts`: Points to an array of `fd_exec_test_acct_state` structures representing the modified accounts.
    - `cu_avail`: Represents the available compute units after execution.
    - `return_data`: Points to the instruction's return data as a `pb_bytes_array_t`.
- **Description**: Represents the effects of executing an instruction, including the result status, any custom error codes, the list of modified accounts, available compute units, and return data. This structure is used to capture the outcome of an instruction execution, detailing both the success or failure and any changes made to account states.


---
### fd\_exec\_test\_instr\_fixture\_t
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `has_metadata`: Indicates if metadata is present.
    - `metadata`: Holds the metadata of type `fd_exec_test_fixture_metadata_t`.
    - `has_input`: Indicates if input data is present.
    - `input`: Contains the input context of type `fd_exec_test_instr_context_t`.
    - `has_output`: Indicates if output data is present.
    - `output`: Contains the output effects of type `fd_exec_test_instr_effects_t`.
- **Description**: Represents a test fixture for instruction processing, containing optional metadata, input context, and output effects.
