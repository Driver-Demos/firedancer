Defines nanopb-generated structures and initializers for handling ELF binary loading and testing.

# Purpose
This code is a C header file generated by the nanopb tool, which is used for encoding and decoding Protocol Buffers in C. The file defines several data structures and associated macros for handling ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) binaries within a specific context, likely related to the Solana blockchain's sealevel runtime. The primary structures defined include `fd_exec_test_elf_binary_t`, `fd_exec_test_elf_loader_ctx_t`, `fd_exec_test_elf_loader_effects_t`, and `fd_exec_test_elf_loader_fixture_t`. These structures are used to represent an ELF binary, the context for loading the ELF binary, the effects of loading the ELF binary, and a fixture for testing ELF loading, respectively.

The file includes initialization macros for these structures, which provide default and zeroed values. It also defines field tags and field lists for each structure, which are used in the nanopb encoding and decoding process. The header file ensures compatibility with a specific version of the nanopb generator and includes necessary dependencies such as `pb_firedancer.h`, `context.pb.h`, and `metadata.pb.h`. Additionally, it provides external declarations for message descriptors, which are used by nanopb to manage the encoding and decoding of the defined structures. The file is intended to be included in other C source files that require these data structures and their associated functionality.

# Data Structures

---
### fd\_exec\_test\_elf\_binary\_t
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - ``data``: Pointer to a `pb_bytes_array_t` structure that holds the binary data.
- **Description**: Represents an ELF binary by encapsulating its data in a `pb_bytes_array_t` structure, which is used to store the binary content of the ELF file.


---
### fd\_exec\_test\_elf\_loader\_ctx\_t
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `has_elf`: Indicates if an ELF binary is present.
    - `elf`: Holds the ELF binary data.
    - `has_features`: Indicates if features are present.
    - `features`: Holds the feature set data.
    - `deploy_checks`: Indicates if deployment checks are enabled.
- **Description**: Encapsulates the context for loading an ELF binary, including the binary itself, associated features, and deployment checks.


---
### fd\_exec\_test\_elf\_loader\_effects\_t
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `rodata`: Pointer to a `pb_bytes_array_t` that holds read-only data.
    - `rodata_sz`: Size of the read-only data in bytes.
    - `text_cnt`: Count of text segments in the read-only data.
    - `text_off`: Offset of the text segment within the read-only data.
    - `entry_pc`: Program counter entry point for the ELF binary.
    - `calldests_count`: Number of call destinations.
    - `calldests`: Pointer to an array of call destination addresses.
    - `error`: Error code indicating the result of the ELF load operation.
- **Description**: Captures the results of loading an ELF binary, including read-only data, text segment details, entry point, call destinations, and any error encountered during the load process.


---
### fd\_exec\_test\_elf\_loader\_fixture\_t
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `has_metadata`: Indicates if metadata is present.
    - `metadata`: Holds the metadata information.
    - `has_input`: Indicates if input data is present.
    - `input`: Contains the input context for the ELF loader.
    - `has_output`: Indicates if output data is present.
    - `output`: Stores the effects of the ELF loader.
- **Description**: Represents a fixture for testing an ELF loader, containing optional metadata, input context, and output effects.
