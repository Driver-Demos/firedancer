A shell script to run multiple ledger backtests with specified parameters on different networks.

# Purpose
This script is a Bash file that automates the execution of a series of ledger backtests using the `run_ledger_backtest.sh` script located in the `src/flamenco/runtime/tests` directory. Each line in the script calls the backtest script with specific parameters, such as the ledger identifier (`-l`), the number of years (`-y`), the maximum number of transactions (`-m`), the end block number (`-e`), and the version of the codebase (`-c`). Some lines include additional options, such as `-g` for genesis or `-o` for specifying output options. The script is configured to stop execution if any command fails, as indicated by the `set -e` command at the beginning. This script is relevant to the codebase as it provides a systematic way to test different ledger scenarios across various network environments, such as testnet, mainnet, devnet, and local configurations.
# Content Summary
The provided script is a Bash script that executes a series of commands to run ledger backtests using a specific script located at `src/flamenco/runtime/tests/run_ledger_backtest.sh`. The script is configured to terminate immediately if any command exits with a non-zero status, as indicated by the `set -e` command.

Each command in the script calls the `run_ledger_backtest.sh` script with several parameters:

- `-l`: Specifies the ledger identifier, which includes the network type (e.g., mainnet, testnet, devnet) and a version number (e.g., v2.3.0, v3.0.0).
- `-y`: Indicates the number of years for the backtest.
- `-m`: Sets the maximum number of transactions to process.
- `-e`: Defines the end block number for the backtest.
- `-c`: Specifies the version of the software to use for the backtest.
- `-g`: An optional flag used in some commands, possibly indicating a special mode or configuration.
- `-o`: An optional parameter that appears in some commands, followed by a comma-separated list of identifiers, which may represent specific configurations or options for the backtest.

The script includes a variety of ledger identifiers, covering different network types and configurations. Some commands are commented out, indicating they are not executed. The script is designed to test different scenarios and configurations by varying the parameters for each backtest.
