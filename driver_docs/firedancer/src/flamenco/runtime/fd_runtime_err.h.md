Defines runtime execution success and transaction error codes for the Firedancer Flamenco runtime.

# Purpose
This C header file defines a set of constants representing error codes related to transaction processing in a runtime environment. The file includes a success code, `FD_RUNTIME_EXECUTE_SUCCESS`, which indicates successful execution, and a series of negative integer constants that represent various transaction errors. These error codes cover a range of issues, such as account-related errors, insufficient funds, invalid operations, and system limitations. Each error code is associated with a specific condition, such as `FD_RUNTIME_TXN_ERR_ACCOUNT_IN_USE` for an account that is already in use, or `FD_RUNTIME_TXN_ERR_INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS_FOR_FEE` for insufficient funds to cover a transaction fee. This file is used to standardize error reporting and handling within the runtime system.
