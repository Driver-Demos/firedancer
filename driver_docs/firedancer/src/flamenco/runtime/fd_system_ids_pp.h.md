Defines system and program IDs as macros for preprocessor-time use with unsigned integer representation.

# Purpose
This code is a collection of macro definitions in a C source file, which represent unique identifiers as arrays of unsigned integers (`uints`). Each macro, such as `SYSVAR_PROG_ID` or `TOKEN_PROG_ID`, defines a sequence of hexadecimal values that are used to identify specific system variables, programs, or features within a software system. These identifiers are likely used at the preprocessor level to facilitate the handling of unsigned data, as the preprocessor treats literal `uints` and `ulongs` as unsigned. The file does not include an include guard, as it only contains macro definitions, which do not require one.
