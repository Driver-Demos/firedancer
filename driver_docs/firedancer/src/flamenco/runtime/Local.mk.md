Makefile for adding headers, objects, and unit tests to the `fd_flamenco` runtime in the `firedancer` codebase.

# Purpose
The Makefile content defines build rules and dependencies for a software project. It uses conditional statements to include headers and object files based on the presence of certain features, such as `FD_HAS_INT128`, `FD_HAS_ATOMIC`, and `FD_HAS_ROCKSDB`. The `add-hdrs` and `add-objs` functions are used to specify header and object files that are part of the build process, associating them with the `fd_flamenco` module. The file also defines unit tests using the `make-unit-test` and `run-unit-test` functions, specifying the test names and their dependencies. Conditional compilation is employed to include specific components only if certain conditions are met, ensuring that the build process is adaptable to different environments and configurations.
