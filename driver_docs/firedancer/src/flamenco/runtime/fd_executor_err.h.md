Defines instruction error types and codes for the Firedancer executor runtime.

# Purpose
This C header file defines a set of constants used to represent error types and error codes for an executor in a runtime environment. The file includes definitions for different kinds of instruction errors, such as `FD_EXECUTOR_ERR_KIND_NONE`, `FD_EXECUTOR_ERR_KIND_EBPF`, `FD_EXECUTOR_ERR_KIND_SYSCALL`, and `FD_EXECUTOR_ERR_KIND_INSTR`. It also provides a comprehensive list of error codes that describe various failure conditions that can occur during the execution of instructions, such as `FD_EXECUTOR_INSTR_ERR_INVALID_ARG` for invalid arguments, `FD_EXECUTOR_INSTR_ERR_INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS` for insufficient account balance, and `FD_EXECUTOR_INSTR_ERR_COMPUTE_BUDGET_EXCEEDED` for exceeding computational budget. These constants are used to standardize error reporting and handling within the executor's operation.
