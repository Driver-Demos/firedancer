Defines `fd_runtime_stack_t`, a union for temporary runtime data storage in slot level calculations.

# Purpose
The `fd_runtime_stack.h` file defines a C header file that provides a data structure for managing temporary memory allocations within a runtime environment. This file is part of a larger system and is specifically designed to be used by a component referred to as the "replay tile." The primary purpose of the `fd_runtime_stack_t` union is to facilitate short-lived memory allocations needed for slot-level calculations in the runtime. The union contains several structures that serve different purposes, such as sorting vote accounts by timestamp for clock system variable calculations, staging memory for BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter) program migrations, and managing vote state credits and rewards.

The `fd_runtime_stack_t` union is organized into three main components: `clock_ts`, `bpf_migration`, and `stakes`. The `clock_ts` structure provides memory for sorting vote accounts based on their last vote timestamp, which is necessary for clock sysvar calculations. The `bpf_migration` structure is used to stage various accounts required for deploying new BPF programs at epoch boundaries. The `stakes` structure manages vote state credits, vote rewards, and stake weights, which are essential for recalculating partitioned epoch rewards and determining leader schedules. This header file includes other necessary headers and constants, ensuring that the defined structures have access to the required types and constants for their operations.

# Data Structures

---
### fd\_runtime\_stack
- **Type**: ``union``
- **Members**:
    - ``clock_ts``: Contains staging memory to sort vote accounts by last vote timestamp for clock sysvar calculation.
    - ``bpf_migration``: Holds staging memory for BPF migration, storing various accounts needed for deploying a new BPF program at the epoch boundary.
    - ``stakes``: Includes vote state credits, vote rewards, and stake weights for leader schedule calculation.
- **Description**: Serves as stack memory to store temporary data for the runtime, used specifically for slot level calculations and owned by the replay tile for short-lived allocations.

- **Description**: `fd_runtime_stack_t` is a union that serves as stack memory for temporary data storage in the runtime, specifically for slot level calculations. It is used by the replay tile for short-lived allocations and includes three main components: `clock_ts` for sorting vote accounts by timestamp, `bpf_migration` for staging accounts during BPF program deployment, and `stakes` for managing vote state credits, rewards, and stake weights.
