Defines a thread-safe cache for vote accounts, mapping public keys to vote account details, with functions for managing and querying vote states.

# Purpose
The code defines a C header file for managing vote states in a distributed system. It provides a data structure, `fd_vote_states_t`, which acts as a cache for vote accounts. This cache maps the public key of a vote account to various details such as stake, last vote slot/timestamp, and commission. The vote states are designed to be thread-safe, but the caller must synchronize concurrent reads and writes. The code includes definitions for managing multiple instances of vote states, which are used at different points in the system's runtime, particularly around epoch reward and leader schedule calculations.

The header file also defines several functions for interacting with the vote states. These functions allow for creating, joining, updating, querying, and removing vote states. The [`fd_vote_states_update_from_account`](<#fd_vote_states_update_from_account>) function is notable for decoding vote account data into a versioned vote state object. Additionally, the code provides an iterator API for traversing the vote states, which is a wrapper over an iterator from `fd_map_chain.c`. The file includes constants and macros for alignment and footprint calculations, ensuring that the data structures are correctly aligned in memory. The header file is intended to be included in other C files, providing a public API for managing vote states in the system.
