Header file for including `fd_flamenco_base.h` in the Firedancer Flamenco module.

# Purpose
This code is a simple C header file that uses include guards to prevent multiple inclusions of the same header file. The macro `HEADER_fd_src_flamenco_fd_flamenco_h` is defined to ensure that the contents of the file are only included once during compilation. The file includes another header file, `fd_flamenco_base.h`, which suggests that it is part of a larger codebase where `fd_flamenco_base.h` provides foundational definitions or declarations needed by other components. The use of include guards is a common practice to avoid redefinition errors and to manage dependencies in C projects.
