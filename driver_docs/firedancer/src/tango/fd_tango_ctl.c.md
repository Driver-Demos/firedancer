A command-line tool for managing and querying memory caches, sequence numbers, and control signals.

# Purpose
The code is an executable C program that serves as a command-line interface for managing various shared memory constructs such as `mcache`, `dcache`, `fseq`, `cnc`, and `tcache`. It includes functionality to create, delete, query, and update these constructs, which are likely used for inter-process communication or data caching. The program processes commands passed as arguments and performs operations based on the command type, such as `new-mcache`, `delete-mcache`, `query-mcache`, and similar commands for other constructs. Each command has specific requirements for arguments, and the program provides error messages if the arguments are insufficient or invalid.

The program uses several external functions and macros, such as `fd_boot`, `fd_halt`, `fd_wksp_attach`, and `fd_wksp_alloc`, which are likely part of a larger framework or library for managing shared memory and related resources. The code includes error handling to ensure that operations are successful, and it logs notices for successful command execution. The program is designed to run on hosted platforms, as indicated by the `#if FD_HAS_HOSTED` preprocessor directive, and it provides a fallback main function for unsupported platforms that logs an error message.
# Imports and Dependencies

### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../src/tango/fd_tango_ctl.c#L743>)

Initializes the environment, checks argument count, logs errors if conditions are not met, and halts the program.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments passed to the program.
    - `argv`: An array of strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Calls `fd_boot` to initialize the environment with `argc` and `argv`.
    - Checks if `argc` is less than 1 and logs an error if true.
    - Checks if `argc` is greater than 1 and logs an error if true, indicating the platform does not support `fd_tango_ctl`.
    - Logs a notice that 0 commands were processed.
    - Calls `fd_halt` to halt the program.
- **Output**: Returns 0, indicating successful execution.
