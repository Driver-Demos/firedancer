A benchmarking tool for fragment transmission using synthetic load and flow control in a network environment.

# Purpose
The code is a C program designed to simulate network packet transmission and flow control. It is intended to be executed in an environment that supports hosted execution and AVX (Advanced Vector Extensions) capabilities. The program initializes various components such as command-and-control (CNC) structures, memory caches, and flow control mechanisms. It processes command-line arguments to configure parameters like CNC, memory cache, data cache, and other transmission settings. The program uses these configurations to simulate the transmission of synthetic network packets, managing flow control and diagnostics throughout the process.

The main functionality involves generating synthetic packet bursts with specified payload sizes and framing overheads, and publishing these packets to a memory cache for consumption by other components. The program includes mechanisms for handling backpressure, updating sequence numbers, and logging performance metrics. It also performs periodic housekeeping tasks such as updating synchronization information and checking for control signals. The program concludes by cleaning up resources and signaling the end of execution. If the required capabilities are not present, the program logs a warning and exits without performing the test.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `fd_tango.h`
- `math.h`


# Global Variables

---
### fctl\_mem
- **Type**: ``uchar[]``
- **Description**: An array of unsigned characters (`uchar`) with a size determined by the macro `FD_FCTL_FOOTPRINT` applied to `RX_MAX`. The array is aligned according to `FD_FCTL_ALIGN`.
- **Use**: Used to allocate memory for flow control operations in the program.


---
### \_fseq
- **Type**: ``char *` array`
- **Description**: An array of character pointers with a size defined by `RX_MAX`. Each element in the array is intended to store a string that represents a flow sequence identifier for reliable reception.
- **Use**: Used to store and manage flow sequence identifiers for reliable data reception in the program.


# Functions

### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../src/tango/bench_frag_tx.c#L322>)

Initializes the environment and logs a warning if the required capabilities are not present, then halts execution.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments.
    - `argv`: An array of strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Calls `fd_boot` to initialize the environment with the command-line arguments.
    - Logs a warning message indicating that the unit test requires `FD_HAS_HOSTED` and `FD_HAS_AVX` capabilities.
    - Calls `fd_halt` to stop further execution.
    - Returns 0 to indicate successful termination.
- **Output**: Returns 0, indicating successful termination of the program.
