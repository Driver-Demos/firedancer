Tests for the `fd_tempo` module, including wallclock, tickcount, and asynchronous timing functions.

# Purpose
The code is an executable C program designed to test and validate various timing and random number generation functionalities. It begins by initializing a random number generator using `fd_rng_new` and `fd_rng_join`. The program then performs a series of tests on timing models and functions, such as `fd_tempo_wallclock_model`, `fd_tempo_tickcount_model`, and `fd_tempo_tick_per_ns`, to ensure they return valid and consistent results. These functions are tested for their ability to provide accurate timing measurements, and the results are logged using `FD_LOG_NOTICE`.

The program also tests the `fd_tempo_observe_pair` function to measure time intervals and validate the consistency of observed timing pairs. Additionally, it checks the behavior of the `fd_tempo_lazy_default` function with various input values to ensure it returns expected results. The code includes tests for asynchronous timing functions, such as `fd_tempo_async_min` and `fd_tempo_async_reload`, to verify their correctness in generating timing intervals. The program concludes by cleaning up the random number generator and logging a "pass" message before halting execution with `fd_halt`.

[View Source →](<../../../../../src/tango/tempo/test_tempo.c#L3>)

Initializes the environment, performs various timing and random number generation tests, and logs the results.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments.
    - `argv`: An array of command-line argument strings.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Calls `fd_boot` to initialize the environment with command-line arguments.
    - Initializes a random number generator `rng` using `fd_rng_new` and `fd_rng_join`.
    - If `FD_HAS_DOUBLE` is defined, performs timing tests using `fd_tempo_wallclock_model`, `fd_tempo_tickcount_model`, and `fd_tempo_tick_per_ns`, logging results and verifying values with `FD_TEST`.
    - Performs observation tests using `fd_tempo_observe_pair`, logging and verifying time differences.
    - Tests `fd_tempo_lazy_default` with various values, verifying expected results with `FD_TEST`.
    - Tests `fd_tempo_async_min` and verifies the result is a power of two using `fd_ulong_is_pow2`.
    - Runs a loop to test `fd_tempo_async_reload` with random values, verifying constraints with `FD_TEST`.
    - Deletes the random number generator using `fd_rng_delete` and `fd_rng_leave`.
    - Logs a final notice indicating the tests passed and calls `fd_halt` to terminate the program.
- **Output**: Returns 0 to indicate successful execution.
