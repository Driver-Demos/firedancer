Unit tests for verifying the alignment, footprint, and functionality of dcache operations.

# Purpose
The code is a C program designed to test the functionality and integrity of a data cache (dcache) system. It includes a series of static assertions to verify the alignment and footprint of various cache components, such as `FD_CHUNK_ALIGN`, `FD_DCACHE_ALIGN`, and `FD_DCACHE_FOOTPRINT`. These assertions ensure that the cache system meets specific size and alignment requirements. The program also defines maximum allowable sizes for data and application segments (`DATA_MAX` and `APP_MAX`) and uses these to allocate shared memory for the cache.

The [`main`](<#main>) function initializes the environment and parses command-line arguments to determine the sizes of the data and application segments. It then performs a series of tests to validate the cache's alignment, footprint calculations, and data size requirements. The program tests the creation, joining, and destruction of the cache, as well as the safety and correctness of compacting operations within the cache. It uses random number generation to simulate various cache configurations and verifies that the cache behaves as expected under these conditions. The program concludes by logging the results and halting execution.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `../fd_tango.h`


# Global Variables

---
### shmem
- **Type**: ``ulong[]``
- **Description**: An array of unsigned long integers with a size determined by the macro `FD_DCACHE_FOOTPRINT` using `DATA_MAX` and `APP_MAX` as parameters. The array is aligned to `FD_DCACHE_ALIGN` to ensure proper memory alignment for cache operations.
- **Use**: Used to allocate shared memory for data cache operations in the program.


# Functions

### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/tango/dcache/test_dcache.c#L63>)

Executes a series of tests on data cache (dcache) operations, including creation, joining, accessor functions, and compactness checks, using command-line arguments for configuration.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments.
    - `argv`: An array of strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Initialize the environment with `fd_boot` using `argc` and `argv`.
    - Extract `--data-sz` and `--app-sz` from command-line arguments using `fd_env_strip_cmdline_ulong` with maximum limits `DATA_MAX` and `APP_MAX`.
    - Log an error and exit if `data_sz` or `app_sz` exceed their respective maximum limits.
    - Log the current testing configuration with `data_sz` and `app_sz`.
    - Initialize a random number generator `rng` using `fd_rng_new` and `fd_rng_join`.
    - Test dcache alignment with `fd_dcache_align` and `FD_DCACHE_ALIGN`.
    - Run a loop 1,000,000 times to test `fd_dcache_footprint` and `fd_dcache_req_data_sz` against expected values using random sizes.
    - Calculate the dcache footprint for `data_sz` and `app_sz` and log an error if it is zero.
    - Test failure cases for `fd_dcache_new` with various invalid inputs and ensure they return `NULL`.
    - Create a new dcache with `fd_dcache_new` and test its validity.
    - Test failure cases for `fd_dcache_join` with invalid inputs and ensure they return `NULL`.
    - Join the dcache with `fd_dcache_join` and test its alignment.
    - Test dcache accessor functions for data and application sizes and their alignment.
    - Initialize dcache regions with test patterns and verify their correctness.
    - Test compactness safety and chunk calculations for dcache using `fd_dcache_compact_is_safe`, `fd_dcache_compact_chunk0`, `fd_dcache_compact_chunk1`, and `fd_dcache_compact_wmark`.
    - Run additional tests for compactness safety with different base references and chunk calculations.
    - Test `fd_dcache_compact_next` for valid chunk transitions within the watermark range.
    - Test dcache destruction with `fd_dcache_leave` and `fd_dcache_delete` for valid and invalid inputs.
    - Delete the random number generator with `fd_rng_delete` and `fd_rng_leave`.
    - Log a success message and halt the program with `fd_halt`.
- **Output**: Returns 0 to indicate successful execution.
