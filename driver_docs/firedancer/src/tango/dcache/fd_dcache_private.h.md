Defines the structure and functions for managing the layout of a shared memory region in a dcache.

# Purpose
This C header file defines the structure and functions related to the management of a shared memory region for a data cache, referred to as `dcache`. It includes a macro `FD_DCACHE_MAGIC` to identify the layout of the shared memory region. The `fd_dcache_private_hdr` structure specifies the layout details, including fields for magic number verification, data size, application size, and application offset, all aligned to `FD_DCACHE_ALIGN`. The file also provides inline functions to access and manipulate the `dcache` and its header, ensuring proper alignment and memory layout. These functions facilitate the retrieval of constant and mutable pointers to the data cache and its header, supporting efficient memory operations within the shared memory region.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `fd_dcache.h`


# Data Structures

---
### fd\_dcache\_private\_hdr
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `magic`: A magic number that identifies the layout of the shared memory region.
    - `data_sz`: The size of the data region in bytes.
    - `app_sz`: The size of the application region in bytes.
    - `app_off`: The offset of the application region relative to the first byte of the header.
    - `guard`: An aligned array used as a guard with a footprint defined by `FD_DCACHE_GUARD_FOOTPRINT`.
- **Description**: Defines the layout of a shared memory region for a dcache, including metadata for data and application regions, and alignment padding.


---
### fd\_dcache\_private\_hdr\_t
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `magic`: A magic number used to signal the layout of the shared memory region.
    - `data_sz`: Specifies the size of the data region in bytes.
    - `app_sz`: Specifies the size of the application region in bytes.
    - `app_off`: Indicates the location of the application region relative to the first byte of the header.
    - `guard`: An aligned array used for padding to ensure memory alignment.
- **Description**: Defines the layout of a shared memory region for a dcache, including metadata such as magic number, sizes, and offsets for data and application regions, with padding for alignment.


# Functions

---
### fd\_dcache\_private\_cache\_const<!-- {{#callable:fd_dcache_private_cache_const}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/tango/dcache/fd_dcache_private.h#L43>)

Returns a pointer to the first byte after the `fd_dcache_private_hdr_t` structure in a memory block.
- **Inputs**:
    - `dcache`: A pointer to a constant `fd_dcache_private_hdr_t` structure, representing the header of a dcache memory block.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Calculate the address of the first byte after the `fd_dcache_private_hdr_t` structure by incrementing the pointer `dcache` by 1 unit of `fd_dcache_private_hdr_t`.
    - Cast the resulting address to a pointer of type `uchar const *`.
    - Return the casted pointer.
- **Output**: A pointer of type `uchar const *` to the first byte after the `fd_dcache_private_hdr_t` structure in the memory block.


---
### fd\_dcache\_private\_dcache<!-- {{#callable:fd_dcache_private_dcache}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/tango/dcache/fd_dcache_private.h#L48>)

Returns a pointer to the data cache section immediately following the header in a shared memory region.
- **Inputs**:
    - `dcache`: A pointer to a `fd_dcache_private_hdr_t` structure representing the header of a shared memory region.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Calculate the address immediately after the `fd_dcache_private_hdr_t` structure by incrementing the pointer `dcache` by 1.
    - Cast the resulting address to a `uchar *` type.
- **Output**: A pointer of type `uchar *` to the data cache section following the header.


---
### fd\_dcache\_private\_hdr\_const<!-- {{#callable:fd_dcache_private_hdr_const}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/tango/dcache/fd_dcache_private.h#L53>)

Calculates the address of the `fd_dcache_private_hdr_t` structure from a given pointer to the data cache.
- **Inputs**:
    - `dcache`: A constant pointer to an unsigned character (`uchar const *`) representing the start of the data cache.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Cast the `dcache` pointer to an unsigned long integer (`ulong`).
    - Subtract the size of the `fd_dcache_private_hdr_t` structure from the `dcache` pointer value.
    - Cast the result back to a constant pointer of type `fd_dcache_private_hdr_t`.
- **Output**: A constant pointer to `fd_dcache_private_hdr_t`, representing the header of the data cache.
