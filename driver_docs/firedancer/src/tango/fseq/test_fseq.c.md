Tests the functionality and alignment of the `fd_fseq` sequence management in shared memory.

# Purpose
This code is a test suite for validating the functionality of a sequence management system, likely part of a larger framework. It includes static assertions to verify alignment and footprint constants for sequence (`FD_FSEQ_ALIGN`, `FD_FSEQ_FOOTPRINT`) and application-specific data (`FD_FSEQ_APP_ALIGN`, `FD_FSEQ_APP_FOOTPRINT`). The main function initializes the environment and sets up a random number generator. It then performs a series of tests to ensure that sequence creation, joining, updating, and deletion functions behave as expected. The tests include checking for correct alignment, handling of null and misaligned pointers, and verifying that sequence updates and queries return the expected values.

The code uses a shared memory buffer `shmem` to simulate sequence operations and tests various failure cases to ensure robustness. It checks the behavior of functions like `fd_fseq_new`, `fd_fseq_join`, `fd_fseq_update`, `fd_fseq_leave`, and `fd_fseq_delete` under different conditions. The test suite also verifies that the application-specific data is correctly aligned and initialized. Logging is used to provide feedback on the test progress, and the program concludes by cleaning up resources and halting the environment. This code is intended to be executed as a standalone program to validate the sequence management functionality.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `../fd_tango.h`


# Global Variables

---
### shmem
- **Type**: ``uchar[]``
- **Description**: An array of unsigned characters with a size defined by the macro `FD_FSEQ_FOOTPRINT`. The array is aligned in memory according to the `FD_FSEQ_ALIGN` macro.
- **Use**: Used as a shared memory buffer for sequence operations in the program.


# Functions

---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/tango/fseq/test_fseq.c#L9>)

Initializes the environment, tests sequence functions, and validates memory alignment and sequence operations.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments.
    - `argv`: An array of command-line argument strings.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Calls `fd_boot` to initialize the environment with command-line arguments.
    - Retrieves the initial sequence number `seq0` from command-line arguments or defaults to 1234.
    - Logs the initial sequence number for testing purposes.
    - Initializes a random number generator `rng`.
    - Validates alignment and footprint constants using `FD_TEST`.
    - Creates a new sequence object `shfseq` with `fd_fseq_new` and joins it to `fseq`.
    - Tests failure cases for `fd_fseq_new` and `fd_fseq_join` with null and misaligned inputs.
    - Modifies and tests the magic value of `shfseq` to ensure proper error handling.
    - Retrieves application-specific memory addresses and validates alignment and zero-initialization.
    - Verifies initial sequence number and queries the sequence using `fd_fseq_seq0` and `fd_fseq_query`.
    - Performs a loop to update the sequence with random values and validates the sequence operations.
    - Tests `fd_fseq_leave` and `fd_fseq_delete` for null and misaligned inputs, and verifies proper deletion.
    - Logs a success message and calls `fd_halt` to terminate the program.
- **Output**: Returns 0 to indicate successful execution.
