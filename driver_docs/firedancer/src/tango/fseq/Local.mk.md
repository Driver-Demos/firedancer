Makefile for adding headers, objects, and unit tests for `fd_fseq` in the `firedancer` codebase.

# Purpose
The `Makefile` content defines build and test instructions for a software project. It adds the header file `fd_fseq.h` to the build process and includes object files `fd_fseq` and `fd_tango`. It also specifies a unit test named `test_fseq`, which depends on `fd_tango` and `fd_util`, and includes instructions to run this unit test.
