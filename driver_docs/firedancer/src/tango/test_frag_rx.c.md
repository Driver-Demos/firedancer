A test program for receiving and processing fragments with flow control and diagnostics in a Tango environment.

# Purpose
The code is an executable C program that performs a sequence of operations related to data flow control and diagnostics in a high-performance computing environment. It is designed to run on systems with specific capabilities, as indicated by the preprocessor directives `FD_HAS_HOSTED` and `FD_HAS_AVX`. The program initializes various components such as random number generators, command-and-control (CNC) interfaces, memory caches, and flow sequence (FSEQ) structures. It processes command-line arguments to configure these components, ensuring that necessary parameters are provided.

The main functionality of the program involves joining and interacting with shared memory workspaces and caches, managing flow control information, and performing diagnostics. It uses a loop to wait for and process data fragments, handling overruns and validating data integrity. The program logs performance metrics and diagnostic information, and it responds to control signals to manage its execution state. The code includes mechanisms for both reliable and unreliable modes of operation, depending on the presence of certain command-line arguments. The program concludes by cleaning up resources and signaling the end of its execution.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `fd_tango.h`


# Global Variables

---
### fseq\_mem
- **Type**: ``uchar[]``
- **Description**: An array of unsigned characters with a size defined by the macro `FD_FSEQ_FOOTPRINT`. The array is aligned according to the `FD_FSEQ_ALIGN` macro.
- **Use**: Used to allocate memory for flow sequence operations, particularly when creating a new flow sequence in unreliable mode.


# Functions

### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../src/tango/test_frag_rx.c#L291>)

Initializes the environment, logs a warning about missing capabilities, and halts execution.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments.
    - `argv`: An array of strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Calls `fd_boot` to initialize the environment with the command-line arguments.
    - Logs a warning message indicating that the unit test requires `FD_HAS_HOSTED` and `FD_HAS_AVX` capabilities.
    - Calls `fd_halt` to stop the program execution.
    - Returns 0 to indicate successful termination.
- **Output**: Returns 0, indicating successful termination of the program.
