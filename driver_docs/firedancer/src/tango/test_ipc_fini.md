A shell script to finalize IPC tests by deleting workspace and configuration files.

# Purpose
This script is a Bash executable that manages the initialization and cleanup of a configuration file for inter-process communication (IPC) testing. It checks for the existence of the `tmp/test_ipc.conf` file and exits with a message if the file is not found, indicating that the environment is not initialized. The script sources the configuration file, sets and exports the `FD_LOG_PATH` variable, and then executes a command to delete a workspace using the `fd_wksp_ctl` utility. Finally, it removes the configuration file and outputs "pass" to indicate successful execution.
# Global Variables
