A unit test for flow control and metadata transmission in a hosted environment with AVX support.

# Purpose
The code is an executable C program designed to perform a unit test for a system that involves flow control, command-and-control (CNC) signaling, and metadata caching. It uses conditional compilation to ensure that it only runs on systems with hosted and AVX capabilities. The program initializes various components such as random number generators, CNC, metadata cache, and flow control structures. It processes command-line arguments to configure these components, including CNC and metadata cache paths, flow sequence identifiers, and other parameters like transaction index and seed for random number generation.

The main functionality of the program involves joining and configuring flow control for multiple reliable receivers, updating synchronization and diagnostic information, and handling command-and-control signals. It operates in a loop where it checks for backpressure conditions, updates flow control credits, and publishes metadata with a test pattern. The program logs diagnostic information at regular intervals and handles unexpected signals by attempting to resume normal operation. Upon completion, it performs cleanup by unmapping and deleting the initialized components before exiting.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `fd_tango.h`


# Global Variables

---
### fctl\_mem
- **Type**: ``uchar[]``
- **Description**: An array of unsigned characters (`uchar`) with a size determined by the macro `FD_FCTL_FOOTPRINT(RX_MAX)`. The array is aligned according to the `FD_FCTL_ALIGN` macro.
- **Use**: Used to store memory for flow control operations, as indicated by its use in the `fd_fctl_new` function.


---
### \_fseq
- **Type**: ``char *` array`
- **Description**: An array of character pointers with a size defined by `RX_MAX`. Each element in the array can store a pointer to a character string.
- **Use**: Used to store and manage a list of flow sequence strings, which are tokenized from the command line input `--fseqs`.


# Functions

---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../src/tango/test_meta_tx.c#L219>)

Initializes the environment, logs a warning, and halts execution if the required capabilities are not present.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments.
    - `argv`: An array of command-line arguments.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Calls `fd_boot` to initialize the environment with the command-line arguments.
    - Logs a warning message indicating that the unit test requires `FD_HAS_HOSTED` and `FD_HAS_AVX` capabilities.
    - Calls `fd_halt` to stop the execution of the program.
    - Returns 0 to indicate successful termination.
- **Output**: Returns 0, indicating successful termination of the program.
