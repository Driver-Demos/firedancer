A Bash script to test inter-process communication (IPC) using shared memory and NUMA node configuration.

# Purpose
This script is a Bash executable designed to set up and execute a test for inter-process communication (IPC) using shared memory objects. It requires a configuration file, `tmp/test_ipc.conf`, to be present and initialized with `test_ipc_init` before execution. The script configures and launches multiple receiver processes and a single transmitter process, assigning them to specific CPU cores based on NUMA node configurations. It uses the `taskset` command to bind processes to specific cores and manages the execution flow by sending halt signals to the processes after a predefined duration. The script is intended for performance testing in environments where core and NUMA node assignments are critical.
# Global Variables

---
### FD\_LOG\_PATH
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: `FD_LOG_PATH` is a global variable that is initialized as an empty string. It is intended to store the path for log files.
- **Use**: Used to define the log file path for the script's logging operations.


---
### rx\_cnt
- **Type**: ``int``
- **Description**: `rx_cnt` is a global variable that stores the number of receiver instances to start. It is initialized with the first command-line argument passed to the script.
- **Use**: Controls the number of iterations in loops that start receiver processes and configure their settings.


---
### CORE\_FIRST
- **Type**: ``CORE_FIRST``
- **Description**: `CORE_FIRST` is a global variable that is set to the value of `NUMA_IDX`. It represents the starting core index for CPU allocation in a NUMA (Non-Uniform Memory Access) architecture.
- **Use**: Used to determine the initial CPU core for task allocation in a NUMA-aware environment.


---
### NUMA\_STRIDE
- **Type**: ``NUMA_STRIDE``
- **Description**: `NUMA_STRIDE` is a global variable that determines the increment step for core assignment in a NUMA (Non-Uniform Memory Access) architecture. It is set to the value of `NUMA_CNT`, which likely represents the number of NUMA nodes or a related configuration parameter.
- **Use**: Used to calculate the next core to assign for task execution by incrementing the current core index by `NUMA_STRIDE`.


---
### HALT\_ALL
- **Type**: ``string``
- **Description**: A `string` variable that accumulates command strings to send halt signals to various components in the script. It starts as an empty string and appends halt commands for the transmitter and each receiver based on the number of receivers specified by `rx_cnt`. The halt commands are formatted to signal the respective CNC (Command and Control) components to stop their operations.
- **Use**: Used to construct a command string that is executed to halt all specified components by sending signals to their CNC interfaces.


---
### CORE\_NEXT
- **Type**: `integer`
- **Description**: `CORE_NEXT` is an integer variable that represents the next CPU core index to be used for task assignment. It is initially set to the value of `CORE_FIRST`, which is derived from `NUMA_IDX`, and is incremented by `NUMA_STRIDE` after each task assignment.
- **Use**: Used to determine the CPU core index for assigning tasks to receivers and the transmitter in a loop.
