Unit tests for verifying the alignment, footprint, and functionality of the mcache component.

# Purpose
The code is a C program designed to test the functionality of a memory cache system, specifically focusing on the alignment, footprint, and sequence management of the cache. It includes a series of static assertions to verify that certain constants and calculated values meet expected criteria, ensuring that the memory layout and size are correct. The program uses a random number generator to perform extensive testing of the cache's ability to handle various depths and application sizes, checking for correct alignment and footprint calculations.

The main function initializes the environment and parses command-line arguments to set parameters such as `depth`, `app_sz`, and `seq0`. It then performs a series of tests on the memory cache, including creation, joining, querying, publishing, and destruction operations. The tests cover both normal and edge cases, such as handling null pointers and misaligned memory. The program also verifies the initial state of the cache and checks for corruption after operations. The use of `FD_TEST` macros indicates that the program is structured to validate each operation's success, logging errors if any test fails. The program concludes by cleaning up resources and logging a success message if all tests pass.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `../fd_tango.h`


# Global Variables

---
### shmem
- **Type**: ``uchar[]``
- **Description**: An array of unsigned characters (`uchar`) that is aligned to `FD_MCACHE_ALIGN` and has a size determined by the macro `FD_MCACHE_FOOTPRINT` with parameters `DEPTH_MAX` and `APP_MAX`. The array is declared as a static variable, meaning it is limited to the file scope and retains its value between function calls.
- **Use**: Used as a shared memory buffer for cache operations in the program.


# Functions

---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/tango/mcache/test_mcache.c#L28>)

Executes a series of tests on memory cache operations, including creation, access, and destruction, using command-line parameters for configuration.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments.
    - `argv`: An array of command-line argument strings.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Initialize the environment with `fd_boot` and parse command-line arguments for `--depth`, `--app-sz`, and `--seq0` using `fd_env_strip_cmdline_ulong`.
    - Check if `depth` and `app_sz` exceed their maximum allowed values (`DEPTH_MAX` and `APP_MAX`), and log errors if they do.
    - Log the testing parameters `depth` and `app_sz`.
    - Initialize a random number generator `rng` using `fd_rng_new` and `fd_rng_join`.
    - Test memory cache alignment with `fd_mcache_align` and `fd_mcache_footprint` for various random depths and application sizes.
    - Test failure cases for `fd_mcache_new` with null, misaligned, and zero depth shared memory.
    - Calculate the memory cache footprint and create a new memory cache with `fd_mcache_new`, logging errors if the footprint is invalid.
    - Test failure cases for `fd_mcache_join` with null and misaligned shared memory cache.
    - Test memory cache accessors for depth, application size, and sequence number, ensuring alignment and initial state validity.
    - Perform a series of tests on memory cache entry operations, including sequence number generation, insertion, and eviction checks.
    - Test memory cache for corruption by verifying depth, application size, sequence number, and alignment.
    - Test memory cache destruction with `fd_mcache_leave` and `fd_mcache_delete`, including failure cases for null and misaligned shared memory cache.
    - Delete the random number generator with `fd_rng_delete` and `fd_rng_leave`.
    - Log a success message and halt the program with `fd_halt`.
- **Output**: Returns 0 to indicate successful execution.
