Defines the structure and functions for managing the layout of a shared memory region in a memory cache.

# Purpose
This C header file defines the structure and functions related to the management of a shared memory region for a memory cache, referred to as `mcache`. It includes a macro `FD_MCACHE_MAGIC` to identify the layout of the shared memory region. The `fd_mcache_private_hdr` structure specifies the layout of this region, including fields such as `magic`, `depth`, `app_sz`, `seq0`, and `app_off`, which are used to manage the cache's metadata. The file also provides inline functions to access and manipulate the cache and its metadata, such as [`fd_mcache_private_cache_const`](<#fd_mcache_private_cache_const>), `fd_mcache_private_mcache`, [`fd_mcache_private_hdr_const`](<#fd_mcache_private_hdr_const>), and `fd_mcache_private_hdr`. These functions facilitate the retrieval and modification of the cache's metadata and data regions.

# Data Structures

---
### fd\_mcache\_private\_hdr
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `magic`: A magic number that identifies the layout of the shared memory region.
    - `depth`: Represents the depth of the cache, calculated as 2 raised to the power of `lg_depth`.
    - `app_sz`: Specifies the size of the application region in bytes.
    - `seq0`: The initial sequence number used during creation.
    - `app_off`: Indicates the offset of the application region from the first byte of the header.
    - `seq`: An array aligned to `FD_MCACHE_ALIGN` that holds sequence numbers.
- **Description**: Defines the layout of a shared memory region for a memory cache, including metadata such as a magic number, cache depth, application region size and offset, and sequence numbers. The structure is aligned to `FD_MCACHE_ALIGN` and includes padding for alignment and potential additional static data.


---
### fd\_mcache\_private\_hdr\_t
- **Type**: ``struct fd_mcache_private_hdr``
- **Members**:
    - `magic`: A unique identifier for the memory layout, expected to be `FD_MCACHE_MAGIC`.
    - `depth`: Represents the depth of the cache, calculated as `2^lg_depth` and must be greater than or equal to `FD_MCACHE_LG_BLOCK`.
    - `app_sz`: Specifies the size of the application region in bytes.
    - `seq0`: The initial sequence number used during creation.
    - `app_off`: Indicates the offset of the application region from the start of the header.
    - `seq`: An array aligned to `FD_MCACHE_ALIGN` that holds sequence numbers, with a size defined by `FD_MCACHE_SEQ_CNT`.
- **Description**: Defines the layout of a shared memory region for a memory cache, including metadata such as a magic number for validation, depth of the cache, application-specific size and offset, and sequence numbers for tracking operations.


# Functions

---
### fd\_mcache\_private\_cache\_const<!-- {{#callable:fd_mcache_private_cache_const}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/tango/mcache/fd_mcache_private.h#L44>)

Returns a constant pointer to the first `fd_frag_meta_t` element following the `fd_mcache_private_hdr_t` header.
- **Inputs**:
    - `mcache`: A constant pointer to a `fd_mcache_private_hdr_t` structure, representing the header of a memory cache.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Calculate the address of the first `fd_frag_meta_t` element by incrementing the `mcache` pointer by one unit of `fd_mcache_private_hdr_t`.
    - Cast the resulting address to a constant pointer of type `fd_frag_meta_t`.
    - Return the calculated constant pointer.
- **Output**: A constant pointer to the first `fd_frag_meta_t` element after the `fd_mcache_private_hdr_t` header.


---
### fd\_mcache\_private\_hdr\_const<!-- {{#callable:fd_mcache_private_hdr_const}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/tango/mcache/fd_mcache_private.h#L54>)

Calculates the address of the `fd_mcache_private_hdr_t` structure from a given `fd_frag_meta_t` pointer.
- **Inputs**:
    - `mcache`: A pointer to a `fd_frag_meta_t` structure, representing the start of the fragment metadata.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Casts the `mcache` pointer to an unsigned long integer.
    - Subtracts the size of `fd_mcache_private_hdr_t` from the `mcache` pointer value.
    - Casts the result back to a pointer of type `fd_mcache_private_hdr_t const *`.
- **Output**: A pointer to a constant `fd_mcache_private_hdr_t` structure, which is located just before the given `fd_frag_meta_t` pointer.
