Header file for managing a memory cache (mcache) with functions for construction, access, and synchronization.

# Purpose
The code is a C header file that defines a memory cache (mcache) system for managing metadata associated with data fragments. It provides a set of macros, constants, and functions to facilitate the creation, management, and querying of these caches. The primary purpose of this code is to handle the storage and retrieval of metadata for data fragments in a high-performance computing environment. The mcache system is designed to be used in scenarios where data fragments are produced and consumed at high rates, requiring efficient memory management and access patterns.

Key components of the code include definitions for alignment and footprint requirements (`FD_MCACHE_ALIGN`, `FD_MCACHE_FOOTPRINT`), construction and accessor APIs for creating and interacting with mcaches ([`fd_mcache_new`](<#fd_mcache_new>), [`fd_mcache_join`](<#fd_mcache_join>), [`fd_mcache_leave`](<#fd_mcache_leave>)), and various macros for waiting and querying metadata (`FD_MCACHE_WAIT`, [`fd_mcache_query`](<#fd_mcache_query>)). The code also includes specialized implementations for different hardware capabilities, such as SSE and AVX, to optimize performance. The mcache system is designed to support multiple producers and consumers, with mechanisms to handle sequence numbers and ensure data consistency across different threads and processes.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `../fd_tango_base.h`


# Global Variables

---
### \_fd\_mcache\_wait\_seq\_test
- **Type**: `ulong`
- **Description**: `_fd_mcache_wait_seq_test` is a global variable of type `ulong` that stores the sequence number from the `seq` field of the `fd_frag_meta_t` structure pointed to by `_fd_mcache_wait_mline`. This operation is atomic and typically results in a fast L1 cache hit.
- **Use**: Used within the `FD_MCACHE_WAIT` macro to verify the consistency of the sequence number during a wait operation.


---
### \_fd\_mcache\_wait\_done
- **Type**: `int`
- **Description**: The `_fd_mcache_wait_done` variable is an integer that determines the completion status of a wait operation in the `FD_MCACHE_WAIT` macro. It is calculated based on whether the sequence number found matches the expected sequence number and whether the sequence difference is non-negative, or if the polling limit has been reached.
- **Use**: Used to control the loop in the `FD_MCACHE_WAIT` macro, indicating when the wait operation should terminate.


# Functions
