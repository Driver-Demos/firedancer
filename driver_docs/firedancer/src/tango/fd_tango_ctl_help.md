Command-line tool for managing and querying caches, flow control, and command-control variables.

# Purpose
The `fd_tango_ctl` command-line tool provides a set of commands to manage and interact with various cache and control structures within a workspace (`wksp`). The tool allows users to create, delete, query, and update different types of caches and control variables, such as fragment meta caches (`mcache`), fragment data caches (`dcache`), flow control variables (`fseq`), command and control variables (`cnc`), and tag caches (`tcache`). Each command is designed to perform specific operations, such as setting tags, creating caches with specified parameters, querying the state of caches, and sending signals to control variables. The tool outputs the global address (`gaddr`) of created structures to standard output, enabling further operations on these structures. This functionality is essential for managing memory and control flow in applications that require dynamic allocation and synchronization of resources.
# Content Summary
The provided content describes the usage and commands of a command-line tool named `fd_tango_ctl`. This tool is used for managing various types of caches and control variables within a workspace (`wksp`). The commands are structured to create, delete, query, and update these entities, each identified by a global address (`gaddr`).

Key commands and their functions include:

1. **help**: Displays the help message with command details.

2. **tag val**: Sets a tag for workspace allocations, with a default value of 1.

3. **new-mcache**: Creates a fragment metadata cache with specified depth, application region size, and initial sequence number. Outputs the global address of the created mcache.

4. **delete-mcache**: Deletes the mcache at the specified global address.

5. **query-mcache**: Queries the mcache at the specified address. Outputs sequence information or detailed data based on verbosity.

6. **new-dcache**: Creates a fragment data cache optimized for payloads up to a specified maximum transmission unit (MTU) size. It supports concurrent operations and outputs the global address of the created dcache.

7. **new-dcache-raw**: Creates a raw fragment data cache with specified data and application region sizes.

8. **delete-dcache**: Deletes the dcache at the specified global address.

9. **query-dcache**: Queries the dcache at the specified address, verifying its existence or providing detailed information.

10. **new-fseq**: Creates a flow control variable initialized to a given sequence number.

11. **delete-fseq**: Deletes the flow control variable at the specified address.

12. **query-fseq**: Queries the flow control variable, providing sequence information or detailed data.

13. **update-fseq**: Updates the flow control variable to a new sequence number.

14. **new-cnc**: Creates a command and control variable with a specified type and initial heartbeat. The heartbeat can be set to the current wallclock or tick counter.

15. **delete-cnc**: Deletes the command and control variable at the specified address.

16. **query-cnc**: Queries the command and control variable, providing signal information or detailed data.

17. **signal-cnc**: Sends a signal to the command and control variable and waits for a response, which indicates the state of the thread (running, halted, or failed).

18. **new-tcache**: Creates a tag cache with specified depth and map count, outputting the global address.

19. **delete-tcache**: Deletes the tag cache at the specified address.

20. **query-tcache**: Queries the tag cache, though verbosity is ignored.

21. **reset-tcache**: Resets the tag cache at the specified address.

Each command is designed to manage specific aspects of cache and control variables, providing developers with tools to efficiently handle workspace resources.
