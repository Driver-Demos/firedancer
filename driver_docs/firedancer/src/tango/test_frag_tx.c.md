A unit test for fragment transmission in the Firedancer codebase, simulating network packet bursts and flow control.

# Purpose
The code is a C program designed to simulate network packet transmission and reception under specific conditions. It is an executable file that uses various command-line arguments to configure its operation, such as `--cnc`, `--mcache`, `--dcache`, and others. The program initializes several components, including random number generators, control and command structures, and memory caches, to manage the flow of synthetic network traffic. It uses AVX instructions for efficient data handling and requires specific hardware capabilities (`FD_HAS_HOSTED` and `FD_HAS_AVX`) to run.

The main functionality of the program is to generate synthetic network traffic with configurable parameters like burst size, packet payload, and bandwidth. It uses these parameters to simulate the transmission of packets in bursts, with each burst consisting of multiple packets. The program manages flow control and diagnostics, logging performance metrics and handling backpressure conditions. It also includes mechanisms to handle command-and-control signals, allowing it to start, stop, and resume operations based on external inputs. The program is structured to ensure that it can clean up resources and exit gracefully when required.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `fd_tango.h`
- `math.h`


# Global Variables

---
### fctl\_mem
- **Type**: ``uchar[]``
- **Description**: An array of unsigned characters (`uchar`) that is statically allocated with a size determined by the macro `FD_FCTL_FOOTPRINT` applied to `RX_MAX`. The array is aligned according to the `FD_FCTL_ALIGN` macro.
- **Use**: Used to store memory for flow control operations, as indicated by its use in the `fd_fctl_new` function.


---
### \_fseq
- **Type**: ``char *` array`
- **Description**: An array of character pointers with a size defined by `RX_MAX`. Each element in the array can store a pointer to a character string.
- **Use**: Stores pointers to strings representing reliable RX flow sequence identifiers.


# Functions

---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../src/tango/test_frag_tx.c#L394>)

Initializes the environment and logs a warning if the required capabilities are not present, then halts execution.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments.
    - `argv`: An array of strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Calls `fd_boot` to initialize the environment with the command-line arguments.
    - Logs a warning message indicating that the unit test requires `FD_HAS_HOSTED` and `FD_HAS_AVX` capabilities.
    - Calls `fd_halt` to halt the execution.
    - Returns 0 to indicate successful execution.
- **Output**: Returns 0, indicating successful execution.
