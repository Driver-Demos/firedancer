Tests for static assertions and sequence operations in the Firedancer Tango base.

# Purpose
The code is a C program designed to perform unit tests on various components related to fragment metadata and sequence operations. It includes static assertions to verify the sizes and alignments of data structures such as `fd_frag_meta_t` and constants like `FD_CHUNK_LG_SZ` and `FD_FRAG_META_LG_SZ`. The program uses a random number generator to test sequence operations, such as incrementing and decrementing sequences, and checks the correctness of these operations using assertions. It also tests the conversion between logical and physical addresses for memory chunks and validates the integrity of metadata operations using SIMD instructions when available.

The program is structured as an executable with a [`main`](<#main>) function that initializes a random number generator and performs extensive testing through loops. It verifies the behavior of sequence comparison functions (`fd_seq_lt`, `fd_seq_le`, etc.) and metadata manipulation functions (`fd_frag_meta_ctl`, `fd_frag_meta_sse0`, etc.). The code also includes conditional compilation for AVX instructions, allowing it to test metadata operations using AVX registers if the hardware supports it. The program concludes by logging a success message and halting execution, indicating that all tests have passed.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `fd_tango.h`


# Global Variables

---
### chunk\_mem
- **Type**: ``static uchar``
- **Description**: `chunk_mem` is a two-dimensional array of unsigned characters, with dimensions defined by `CHUNK_CNT` and `FD_CHUNK_SZ`. It is aligned to `FD_CHUNK_ALIGN` to ensure proper memory alignment for efficient access.
- **Use**: Stores memory chunks for processing, with each chunk being accessed using an index derived from random number generation.


# Functions

---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../src/tango/test_tango_base.c#L21>)

Initializes the environment, performs a series of tests on sequence numbers, chunk memory, and metadata, and then terminates.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments.
    - `argv`: An array of strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Calls `fd_boot` to initialize the environment with command-line arguments.
    - Creates a random number generator `rng` using `fd_rng_new` and `fd_rng_join`.
    - Performs static assertions to verify the alignment and size of `fd_frag_meta_t` fields.
    - Executes a loop 100,000,000 times to test sequence number operations using `fd_seq_dec`, `fd_seq_inc`, and comparison functions like `fd_seq_lt`, `fd_seq_le`, etc.
    - Tests chunk memory operations by calculating `chunk_idx` and verifying address conversions with `fd_chunk_to_laddr` and `fd_laddr_to_chunk`.
    - Tests metadata control operations by extracting and verifying control fields using `fd_frag_meta_ctl_orig`, `fd_frag_meta_ctl_som`, etc.
    - If `FD_HAS_AVX` is defined, performs additional tests on AVX and SSE metadata operations, verifying the integrity of `sse0`, `sse1`, and `avx` data.
    - Executes another loop 100,000,000 times to test timestamp compression and decompression using `fd_frag_meta_ts_comp` and `fd_frag_meta_ts_decomp`.
    - Deletes the random number generator using `fd_rng_delete` and `fd_rng_leave`.
    - Logs a notice message indicating the tests passed and calls `fd_halt` to terminate the program.
- **Output**: Returns 0 to indicate successful execution.
