Makefile for building the fd_tango library, binaries, unit tests, and adding test scripts.

# Purpose
The Makefile content defines build instructions for a software project. It uses custom functions to streamline the process of compiling libraries, binaries, and unit tests. The `make-lib` function creates a library named `fd_tango`, while `add-hdrs` adds header files `fd_tango_base.h` and `fd_tango.h` to the build. The `make-bin` function compiles an executable named `fd_tango_ctl` with dependencies on `fd_tango` and `fd_util`. Several `make-unit-test` calls define unit tests for different components, such as `test_tango_base`, `test_meta_tx`, and `test_frag_rx`, each with dependencies on `fd_tango` and `fd_util`. Finally, `add-test-scripts` specifies additional test scripts to be included in the testing process.
