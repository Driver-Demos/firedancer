Unit tests for the `fd_tcache` component, including alignment, footprint, query, remove, reset, and benchmarking functionalities.

# Purpose
The code is a C program designed to test and benchmark a tag cache (`tcache`) system. It includes a main function that initializes the environment, sets up a random number generator, and performs a series of tests to verify the functionality of the `tcache` system. The program checks alignment, footprint calculations, and default map counts, and it performs operations such as querying, inserting, removing, and resetting tags within the cache. The code also includes a benchmarking section that measures the performance of the `tcache` system by inserting a large number of tags and calculating the average time per deduplication operation.

The program uses several command-line arguments to configure the test environment, such as page size, page count, NUMA index, cache depth, and map count. It also logs various stages of the testing process, including the creation of the workspace and `tcache`, the results of the tests, and the benchmarking results. The code is structured to run only if the `FD_HAS_HOSTED` macro is defined, indicating that it requires certain hosted capabilities to execute. If these capabilities are not available, the program logs a warning and exits.
# Imports and Dependencies

Initializes the environment and logs a warning if `FD_HAS_HOSTED` is not defined, then halts execution.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments.
    - `argv`: An array of command-line arguments.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Call `fd_boot` to initialize the environment with `argc` and `argv`.
    - Log a warning message indicating that the unit test requires `FD_HAS_HOSTED` capabilities.
    - Call `fd_halt` to halt the execution.
    - Return 0 to indicate successful execution.
- **Output**: Returns 0 to indicate successful execution.
