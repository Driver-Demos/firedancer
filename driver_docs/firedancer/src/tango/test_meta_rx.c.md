A test program for receiving and processing metadata fragments with flow control and diagnostics.

# Purpose
The code is an executable C program that functions as a unit test for a system that involves command-and-control (CNC) signaling, memory caching, and flow control in a networked environment. It is designed to run on systems with hosted and AVX capabilities, as indicated by the preprocessor directives. The program initializes various components such as random number generators, CNC, and memory caches, and it processes command-line arguments to configure its operation. It uses these components to manage and validate the reception of data fragments, handle overrun conditions, and maintain flow control by sending credits back to a transmitter.

The main loop of the program waits for data fragments, performs housekeeping tasks such as sending flow control credits and monitoring information, and handles command-and-control signals. It uses different methods to wait for and validate fragment metadata, depending on the defined `WAIT_STYLE`. The program logs performance metrics and handles overrun conditions by adjusting the sequence of data fragments. Upon completion or receipt of a halt signal, the program cleans up by unmapping and deleting resources before exiting. If the required capabilities are not present, the program logs a warning and exits without performing the test.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `fd_tango.h`


# Global Variables

---
### fseq\_mem
- **Type**: ``uchar[]``
- **Description**: An array of unsigned characters (`uchar`) with a size defined by the macro `FD_FSEQ_FOOTPRINT`. The array is aligned in memory according to the alignment specified by `FD_FSEQ_ALIGN`.
- **Use**: Used to store memory for flow sequence operations, particularly when creating or joining a flow sequence (`fseq`) in unreliable mode.


# Functions

---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../src/tango/test_meta_rx.c#L238>)

Initializes the environment and logs a warning if the required capabilities are not present, then halts execution.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments.
    - `argv`: An array of strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Calls `fd_boot` to initialize the environment with the command-line arguments.
    - Logs a warning message indicating that the unit test requires `FD_HAS_HOSTED` and `FD_HAS_AVX` capabilities.
    - Calls `fd_halt` to stop the execution of the program.
    - Returns 0 to indicate successful execution.
- **Output**: Returns 0, indicating successful execution.
