Bash script to initialize and configure shared memory for interprocess communication tests.

# Purpose
This script is a Bash executable intended to set up and configure a shared memory workspace for interprocess communication (IPC) in a specific environment. It requires a build directory as an argument and is designed to be run from the base directory of the Firedancer project. The script checks for the necessary NUMA node resources and configures shared memory objects, such as control and cache structures, for both transmission (`TX`) and reception (`RX`) processes. It creates a configuration file (`tmp/test_ipc.conf`) that stores the details of the shared memory setup, which includes parameters like workspace name, NUMA index, and the number of transmission and reception channels. The script also includes diagnostic and setup commands for NUMA topology and shared memory sandbox initialization.
# Global Variables

---
### NUMA\_IDX
- **Type**: `integer`
- **Description**: Specifies the NUMA (Non-Uniform Memory Access) node index used for memory allocation and process execution. It is set to 0, indicating the first NUMA node on the system.
- **Use**: Used to determine the NUMA node for allocating shared memory and other resources in the script.


---
### WKSP
- **Type**: ``string``
- **Description**: The `WKSP` variable is a string that holds the name of a workspace used for interprocess communication in a shared memory environment. It is set to the value 'test_ipc'. This workspace is recreated from scratch if it already exists in the shared memory sandbox.
- **Use**: Used to specify the name of the workspace for shared memory operations and interprocess communication setup.


---
### WKSP\_CNT
- **Type**: `integer`
- **Description**: The variable `WKSP_CNT` is an integer that specifies the number of pages to allocate for a workspace in a shared memory setup. It is used in the context of setting up interprocess communication using shared memory.
- **Use**: Used to define the number of pages for the workspace when creating a new shared memory workspace with the `fd_wksp_ctl` command.


---
### WKSP\_PAGE
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: The `WKSP_PAGE` variable is a string that specifies the type of memory page to use for the workspace. In this script, it is set to 'gigantic', indicating the use of large memory pages.
- **Use**: Used to define the type of memory page for the workspace in shared memory operations.


---
### TX\_MAX
- **Type**: `integer`
- **Description**: Defines the maximum number of transmission (TX) setups that the script will configure. It is set to 1, indicating that only one transmission setup will be created.
- **Use**: Used in a loop to create and configure transmission control, memory cache, and data cache for each transmission setup.


---
### RX\_MAX
- **Type**: `integer`
- **Description**: Defines the maximum number of receive (RX) operations or channels that the script will configure. It is set to 16, indicating that up to 16 RX operations can be initialized.
- **Use**: Used in a loop to set up RX operations, determining how many RX channels are created.


---
### TX\_DEPTH
- **Type**: `integer`
- **Description**: The variable `TX_DEPTH` is an integer that specifies the depth of the transmission (TX) cache. It is set to 32768, indicating the number of entries or the capacity of the TX cache.
- **Use**: Used to define the capacity of the transmission cache in the setup of TX components.


---
### TX\_MTU
- **Type**: `integer`
- **Description**: Defines the maximum transmission unit (MTU) size for the transmission data cache. The value is set to 1542, which typically represents the maximum size of a packet that can be transmitted over a network without fragmentation.
- **Use**: Used to configure the transmission data cache (`TX_DCACHE`) with the specified MTU size.


---
### APP\_SZ
- **Type**: `integer`
- **Description**: The `APP_SZ` variable is an integer that specifies the application size used in the script. It is set to 4032.
- **Use**: Used as a parameter in various function calls to allocate or configure resources with a specific size.


---
### CONF
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: The `CONF` variable is a string that specifies the file path 'tmp/test_ipc.conf'. This file is used to store details about shared memory objects for interprocess communications.
- **Use**: Stores the path where configuration details for shared memory objects are written.
