Makefile for adding headers, objects, and unit tests for `fd_fctl` in the `firedancer` codebase.

# Purpose
The `Makefile` content defines build and test instructions for a software project. It adds the header file `fd_fctl.h` and object files `fd_fctl` and `fd_tango` to the build process. It also specifies a unit test named `test_fctl`, which depends on the `fd_tango` and `fd_util` components, and includes a command to execute this unit test.
