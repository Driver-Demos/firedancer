Unit tests for the `fd_fctl` module, verifying configuration, alignment, and control flow logic.

# Purpose
The code is a C program designed to test the functionality of a flow control library, likely related to data transmission or network communication. It includes a [`main`](<#main>) function, which indicates that it is an executable program. The program begins by initializing the environment and parsing command-line arguments to configure various parameters such as `rx_max`, `rx_cnt`, `rx_cr_max`, `cr_burst`, `cr_max`, `cr_resume`, and `cr_refill`. These parameters are used to set up and test the flow control mechanisms.

The program uses static assertions to ensure certain compile-time conditions are met, such as the alignment and size constraints. It allocates shared memory and initializes arrays for sequence and slow path tracking. The program then performs a series of tests to validate the creation and configuration of flow control objects using functions like `fd_fctl_new`, `fd_fctl_join`, and `fd_fctl_cfg_rx_add`. It checks for failure cases and verifies that the configuration parameters are correctly applied. The program also includes placeholders for more extensive testing, such as `FD_FCTL_RX_CR_RETURN` and `TX_CR_UPDATE`, indicating areas for further development or testing. The program concludes by cleaning up resources and logging the test results.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `../fd_tango.h`


# Global Variables

---
### shmem
- **Type**: ``uchar[]``
- **Description**: An array of unsigned characters with a size determined by the macro `FD_FCTL_FOOTPRINT(RX_MAX)`. The array is aligned to `FD_FCTL_ALIGN` bytes.
- **Use**: Used as shared memory for the `fd_fctl_new` function to manage flow control operations.


---
### rx\_seq
- **Type**: `ulong array`
- **Description**: `rx_seq` is a static array of unsigned long integers with a size defined by `RX_MAX`, which is set to 128. It is initialized to zero and is used to store sequence numbers for receive operations.
- **Use**: Used to store and manage sequence numbers for receive operations in the program.


---
### rx\_slow
- **Type**: ``ulong[]``
- **Description**: An array of unsigned long integers with a size defined by `RX_MAX`. The array is declared as a static variable, meaning it is limited to the file scope and retains its value between function calls.
- **Use**: Stores slow path receive sequence numbers for each receive channel.


# Functions

### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/tango/fctl/test_fctl.c#L12>)

Initializes, configures, and tests flow control settings based on command-line arguments.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments.
    - `argv`: An array of strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Calls `fd_boot` to initialize the environment with command-line arguments.
    - Parses command-line arguments to set various flow control parameters such as `rx_max`, `rx_cnt`, `rx_cr_max`, `cr_burst`, `cr_max`, `cr_resume`, and `cr_refill`.
    - Checks if `rx_max` exceeds `RX_MAX` and logs an error if true.
    - Logs the parsed flow control parameters for testing purposes.
    - Initializes a random number generator using `fd_rng_new` and `fd_rng_join`.
    - Performs alignment and footprint tests using `fd_fctl_align` and `fd_fctl_footprint`.
    - Creates and joins a flow control object using `fd_fctl_new` and `fd_fctl_join`.
    - Tests failure cases for `fd_fctl_new` and `fd_fctl_cfg_rx_add` functions.
    - Configures receive flow control settings using `fd_fctl_cfg_rx_add` and `fd_fctl_cfg_done`.
    - Validates the configured flow control settings using `fd_fctl_rx_max`, `fd_fctl_rx_cnt`, and other related functions.
    - Adjusts flow control parameters if they are set to zero by using default values from the flow control object.
    - Logs the final flow control parameters after adjustment.
    - Performs additional tests on flow control settings, including burst, max, resume, and refill values.
    - Queries and updates flow control credits using `fd_fctl_cr_query` and `fd_fctl_tx_cr_update`.
    - Leaves and deletes the flow control object and random number generator.
    - Logs a success message and halts the program.
- **Output**: Returns 0 to indicate successful execution.
