APIs for ultra-low overhead, credit-based flow control in distributed systems, with emphasis on minimizing backpressure.

# Purpose
The code is a C header file that defines a set of APIs for implementing credit-based flow control in distributed systems. The primary purpose of this module is to manage the flow control between a transmitter and multiple receivers, allowing for efficient data transmission while minimizing backpressure. The module provides both public and private APIs, with the private APIs intended for performance-critical operations that may benefit from compile-time inlining.

Key components include the `fd_fctl_t` structure, which acts as an opaque handle for managing flow control, and several macros and functions for configuring and querying flow control parameters. The module defines constants such as `FD_FCTL_RX_MAX_MAX`, which specifies the maximum number of receivers, and `FD_FCTL_ALIGN`, which specifies memory alignment requirements. Public APIs include functions for creating, joining, and deleting flow control objects, as well as configuring receivers and completing flow control setup. Accessor functions are provided to retrieve configuration values, and functions like [`fd_fctl_tx_cr_update`](<#fd_fctl_tx_cr_update>) and [`fd_fctl_cr_query`](<#fd_fctl_cr_query>) are used to manage and query the available credits for transmission. The module is designed to be used sparingly, as excessive use of flow control can negatively impact system performance.

# Data Structures

### fd\_fctl\_t
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - ``rx_max``: Maximum number of receivers for this flow control, in the range [0,FD_FCTL_RX_MAX_MAX].
    - ``rx_cnt``: Current number of receivers for this flow control, in the range [0,rx_max].
    - ``in_refill``: Indicates if the flow control is currently in a refilling state (0 or 1).
    - ``cr_burst``: Maximum number of credits a transmitter will use in a burst, in the range [1,LONG_MAX].
    - ``cr_max``: Upper bound of the number of credits a transmitter can have, in the range [cr_burst,LONG_MAX].
    - ``cr_resume``: Credit threshold for the flow control to stop trying to refill credits, in the range [cr_burst,cr_max].
    - ``cr_refill``: Credit threshold for the flow control to start trying to refill its credits, in the range [1,cr_resume].
- **Description**: `fd_fctl_t` is an opaque handle to a flow control object that manages flow control for a transmitter with zero or more reliable receivers, allowing backpressure. It is designed to handle credit-based flow control with minimal overhead, supporting dynamic receiver configurations. The structure includes fields for managing the maximum and current number of receivers, credit burst limits, and refill thresholds, ensuring efficient flow control operations.


---
### fd\_fctl\_private\_rx
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `cr_max`: Maximum number of credits safe for the transmitter to burst to the receiver when fully caught up.
    - `seq_laddr`: Pointer to the location where the receiver's current position in the sequence space is stored; `NULL` indicates an inactive receiver.
    - `slow_laddr`: Pointer to the location where statistics for the slowest receiver are accumulated.
- **Description**: The `fd_fctl_private_rx` structure is part of a flow control system that manages credit-based flow control for receivers. It contains fields to track the maximum credits (`cr_max`) a receiver can handle, a pointer to the receiver's sequence position (`seq_laddr`), and a pointer for accumulating statistics on the slowest receiver (`slow_laddr`). This structure is used internally to facilitate efficient flow control operations, particularly in performance-critical loops.


---
### fd\_fctl\_private\_rx\_t
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - ``cr_max``: Maximum number of credits safe for the transmitter to burst to the receiver.
    - ``seq_laddr``: Pointer to the location where the receiver's current sequence position is stored.
    - ``slow_laddr``: Pointer to the location where statistics for the slowest receiver are accumulated.
- **Description**: Defines a structure used in flow control to manage receiver-specific details, including the maximum credits a transmitter can safely send, the receiver's current sequence position, and statistics for identifying the slowest receiver.


---
### fd\_fctl\_private
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - ``rx_max``: Maximum number of receivers for this flow control, in the range [0, `FD_FCTL_RX_MAX_MAX`].
    - ``rx_cnt``: Current number of receivers for this flow control, in the range [0, `rx_max`].
    - ``in_refill``: Indicates if the flow control is currently in a refilling state (0 or 1).
    - ``cr_burst``: Maximum number of credits a transmitter will use in a burst, in the range [1, `LONG_MAX`].
    - ``cr_max``: Upper bound of the number of credits a transmitter can have, in the range [`cr_burst`, `LONG_MAX`].
    - ``cr_resume``: Credit threshold for the flow control to stop refilling credits, in the range [`cr_burst`, `cr_max`].
    - ``cr_refill``: Credit threshold for the flow control to start refilling credits, in the range [1, `cr_resume`].
- **Description**: Manages flow control for a transmitter with multiple receivers, using credit-based mechanisms to handle backpressure and ensure efficient data transmission. The structure maintains the state of the flow control, including the number of receivers, the current refilling state, and various credit thresholds that dictate when the flow control should refill or resume operations. An array of `fd_fctl_private_rx_t` follows the structure, indexed by the number of receivers, to manage individual receiver states.

If any parameter is invalid, the function logs a warning and returns NULL.
- **Inputs**:
    - `fctl`: A pointer to a flow control object. Must not be NULL. The caller retains ownership.
    - `cr_burst`: The maximum number of credits a transmitter will use in a burst. Must be in the range [1, cr_burst_max], where cr_burst_max is the minimum of the maximum credits of all receivers.
    - `cr_max`: An upper bound on the number of credits a transmitter can have. Must be in the range [cr_burst, LONG_MAX]. If set to 0, a reasonable default is chosen.
    - `cr_resume`: The credit threshold for stopping credit refills. Must be in the range [cr_burst, cr_max]. If set to 0, a reasonable default is chosen.
    - `cr_refill`: The credit threshold for starting credit refills. Must be in the range [cr_burst, cr_resume]. If set to 0, a reasonable default is chosen.
