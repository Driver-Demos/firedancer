Header file for including various modules like tempo, cnc, fseq, fctl, mcache, dcache, and tcache.

# Purpose
This code is a C header file that serves as an inclusion guard and manages the inclusion of several other header files related to the `fd_tango` module. The inclusion guard, defined by `#ifndef`, `#define`, and `#endif`, prevents multiple inclusions of the same header file, which can cause compilation errors. The file includes headers from various submodules such as `fd_tempo`, `fd_cnc`, `fd_fseq`, `fd_fctl`, `fd_mcache`, `fd_dcache`, and `fd_tcache`, each of which indirectly includes `fd_tango_base.h`. This structure helps organize dependencies and ensures that the necessary components of the `fd_tango` module are available for use in other parts of the program.
