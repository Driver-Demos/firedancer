A Bash script to test inter-process communication (IPC) using shared memory and NUMA node configuration.

# Purpose
This script is a Bash executable designed to facilitate inter-process communication (IPC) testing. It requires a configuration file, `tmp/test_ipc.conf`, to be present and initialized with shared memory objects. The script sets up and manages the execution of receiver and transmitter processes, using CPU core and NUMA node configurations to optimize performance. It uses the `taskset` command to assign specific CPU cores to these processes, ensuring they run on the desired hardware resources. After starting the processes, the script allows them to run for a specified duration before sending halt commands to terminate them gracefully.
# Global Variables

---
### FD\_LOG\_PATH
- **Type**: ``string``
- **Description**: `FD_LOG_PATH` is a global variable that is initialized as an empty string. It is intended to store the path for log files, but in the current script, it is not assigned any specific value or used further.
- **Use**: Stores the path for log files, but remains unused in the current script.


---
### rx\_cnt
- **Type**: ``int``
- **Description**: The `rx_cnt` variable is an integer that represents the number of receiver instances to start. It is initialized with the first command-line argument passed to the script.
- **Use**: Controls the number of iterations in loops that start receiver processes and configure their settings.


---
### CORE\_FIRST
- **Type**: ``CORE_FIRST``
- **Description**: `CORE_FIRST` is a global variable that is set to the value of `NUMA_IDX`. It represents the starting core index for CPU allocation in a NUMA (Non-Uniform Memory Access) architecture. This variable is used to determine the first core to be used for task assignment in the script.
- **Use**: Used to set the initial core index for task assignment in a NUMA environment.


---
### NUMA\_STRIDE
- **Type**: ``NUMA_STRIDE``
- **Description**: `NUMA_STRIDE` is a global variable that determines the increment step for CPU core allocation across NUMA nodes. It is set to the value of `NUMA_CNT`, which likely represents the number of NUMA nodes or a related configuration parameter.
- **Use**: Used to calculate the next CPU core to allocate for tasks by incrementing the current core index by `NUMA_STRIDE`.


---
### HALT\_ALL
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: Contains a sequence of commands to send halt signals to both transmitter and receiver components in an inter-process communication (IPC) setup. The variable is initialized as an empty string and is appended with halt commands for each receiver and the transmitter based on the number of receivers specified by `rx_cnt`. The commands are formatted to use the `signal-cnc` utility with the respective control names from `TX_CNC` and `RX_CNC` arrays.
- **Use**: Used to construct and store the halt command sequence that is executed to stop all IPC components.


---
### CORE\_NEXT
- **Type**: `integer`
- **Description**: `CORE_NEXT` is an integer variable that represents the next CPU core index to be used for task assignment. It is initialized with the value of `CORE_FIRST`, which is derived from the `NUMA_IDX` variable.
- **Use**: `CORE_NEXT` is used to assign CPU cores to receiver and transmitter tasks in a round-robin fashion, incrementing by `NUMA_STRIDE` after each assignment.
