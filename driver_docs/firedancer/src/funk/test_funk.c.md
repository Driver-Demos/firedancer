Unit tests for the `fd_funk` module, verifying memory alignment, workspace operations, and transaction limits.

# Purpose
The code is a C program designed to perform unit testing on the `fd_funk` module, which is part of a larger software system. The program begins by checking if the `FD_HAS_HOSTED` macro is defined, indicating that the environment supports hosted capabilities. It then initializes the environment and processes command-line arguments to configure various parameters such as workspace name, page size, page count, CPU affinity, workspace tag, seed, transaction maximum, and record maximum. These parameters are used to set up a workspace and allocate shared memory for testing the `fd_funk` functionalities.

The main functionality of the code involves creating, joining, verifying, and deleting instances of `fd_funk` within a shared memory workspace. It performs a series of tests to ensure that the `fd_funk` module behaves as expected under various conditions, including edge cases like zero transactions or records. The program uses assertions to validate the alignment and footprint of the `fd_funk` instances and checks the integrity of the workspace operations. If the tests pass, the program logs a success message and halts; otherwise, it logs errors and exits. If the `FD_HAS_HOSTED` macro is not defined, the program logs a warning and exits without performing the tests.

Initializes the environment and logs a warning if FD_HAS_HOSTED capabilities are not available, then halts execution.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The count of command-line arguments.
    - `argv`: The array of command-line arguments.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Calls `fd_boot` to initialize the environment with command-line arguments.
    - Logs a warning message indicating that the unit test requires `FD_HAS_HOSTED` capabilities.
    - Calls `fd_halt` to stop further execution.
    - Returns 0 to indicate successful termination.
- **Output**: Returns 0, indicating successful termination of the program.
