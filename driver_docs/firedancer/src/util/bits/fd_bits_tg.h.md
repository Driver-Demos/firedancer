Type-generic macros for bit manipulation and arithmetic operations, addressing C/C++ type promotion issues.

# Purpose
The code in `fd_bits_tg.h` provides type-generic macros for bit manipulation and arithmetic operations in C. These macros are designed to infer the type of their arguments and perform operations accordingly, ensuring that the operations are type-safe and consistent with the expected behavior for different data types. The file is not intended to be included directly but is included by another header file, `fd_bits.h`. The macros address certain limitations and inconsistencies in the C language, particularly the automatic type promotion of smaller integer types like `char` and `short` to `int`, which can lead to unexpected behavior and bugs.

The macros defined in this file include operations such as negation, addition, subtraction, bitwise NOT, AND, OR, XOR, and more complex operations like bit masking, setting, clearing, and rotating bits. The file also includes macros for selecting expressions based on the size of a type, using either compiler extensions or standard C constructs, to ensure portability and efficiency. The macros are designed to compile to efficient assembly code, similar to their type-explicit counterparts, and are intended for internal use to provide a consistent and reliable interface for bit manipulation across different data types.
# Global Variables

---
### \_fd\_bits\_n
- **Type**: `int`
- **Description**: The `_fd_bits_n` variable is an integer that represents a compile-time value, mostly used in bit manipulation operations. It is defined as part of a macro that handles bit shifting operations.
- **Use**: Used to determine the number of bits to shift in bit manipulation macros.


---
### \_fd\_bits\_c
- **Type**: `int`
- **Description**: The `_fd_bits_c` variable is an integer that determines whether the shift operation should use `_fd_bits_m` or `_fd_bits_n` based on their comparison. It is used in compile-time calculations to optimize shift operations.
- **Use**: Used to decide the shift amount in compile-time shift operations.
