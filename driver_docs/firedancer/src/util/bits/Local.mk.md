Makefile for adding headers, objects, and unit tests for bits and utility components.

# Purpose
The Makefile content defines a series of build and test operations for a software project. It uses the `add-hdrs` function to include header files such as `fd_bits.h` and `fd_float.h` in the build process. The `add-objs` function specifies object files like `fd_bits` and `fd_util` to be compiled. The `make-unit-test` function creates unit tests for various components, including `test_bits` and `test_float`, associating them with the `fd_util` utility. Finally, the `run-unit-test` function executes these unit tests, ensuring that components like `test_bits` and `test_float` function correctly.
