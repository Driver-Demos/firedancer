Tests for bit manipulation functions across various data types, including uchar, ushort, uint, ulong, and int128.

# Purpose
The code is a C program designed to test various bit manipulation functions for different data types, including `uchar`, `ushort`, `uint`, `ulong`, and potentially `uint128` and `int128` if the platform supports 128-bit integers. The program includes a main function that initializes a random number generator and then performs a series of tests on each data type. These tests verify the correctness of functions such as `fd_is_pow2`, `fd_mask_bit`, `fd_clear_bit`, `fd_set_bit`, `fd_flip_bit`, `fd_insert_bit`, and others, which are used to manipulate bits within these data types.

The program is structured to test each data type in sequence, logging the start of each test with `FD_LOG_NOTICE`. It uses a series of loops and conditional checks to ensure that each bit manipulation function behaves as expected. The tests cover a wide range of operations, including checking if a number is a power of two, setting and clearing specific bits, flipping bits, and performing bitwise shifts and rotations. The program also includes tests for signed data types like `schar`, `short`, `int`, and `long`, verifying operations such as absolute value calculation and conditional swaps. The program concludes by cleaning up the random number generator and logging a "pass" message if all tests are successful.

Executes a series of tests on various data types to validate bit manipulation functions.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments.
    - `argv`: An array of command-line arguments.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Initializes the environment with `fd_boot` and sets up a random number generator `rng`.
    - Performs tests on `uchar`, `ushort`, `uint`, `ulong`, and `uint128` (if available) data types, checking bit manipulation functions like `fd_is_pow2`, `fd_mask_bit`, `fd_clear_bit`, `fd_set_bit`, `fd_flip_bit`, `fd_insert_bit`, `fd_mask_lsb`, `fd_clear_lsb`, `fd_set_lsb`, `fd_flip_lsb`, `fd_insert_lsb`, `fd_popcnt`, `fd_find_lsb`, `fd_find_msb`, `fd_pow2_up`, `fd_pow2_dn`, `fd_bswap`, `fd_is_aligned`, `fd_alignment`, `fd_align_dn`, `fd_align_up`, `fd_blend`, `fd_if`, `fd_abs`, `fd_min`, `fd_max`, `fd_store_if`, `fd_swap`, `fd_swap_if`, `fd_shift_left`, `fd_shift_right`, `fd_rotate_left`, and `fd_rotate_right`.
    - Logs the start of each test with `FD_LOG_NOTICE`.
    - Uses `FD_TEST` to assert the correctness of each function's output.
    - Cleans up by deleting the random number generator with `fd_rng_delete` and halts the program with `fd_halt`.
- **Output**: Returns 0 upon successful completion of all tests.
