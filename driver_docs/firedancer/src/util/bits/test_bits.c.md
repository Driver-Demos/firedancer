Tests for various bit manipulation and integer operations, including conversions, alignment, and mathematical functions.

# Purpose
The code is a comprehensive test suite for various data types and operations in C, including `uchar`, `ushort`, `uint`, `ulong`, `uint128`, `char`, `schar`, `short`, `int`, `long`, `int128`, `float`, and `double`. It tests a wide range of bit manipulation functions, arithmetic operations, and type conversions. The code includes functions to test power-of-two checks, bit masking, bit setting, clearing, flipping, and extraction, as well as functions for counting set bits, finding least and most significant bits, and aligning values. It also tests mathematical operations such as square root and cube root calculations, both exact and approximate.

The code is structured as a C executable with a [`main`](<#main>) function that initializes a random number generator and performs extensive testing on each data type. It uses assertions to verify the correctness of each operation, logging the results of the tests. The code includes conditional compilation for certain features, such as 128-bit integer operations and double-precision floating-point operations, depending on the platform capabilities. The test suite is designed to ensure the reliability and correctness of low-level operations on various data types, which are critical for performance-sensitive applications.

# Functions

### float\_as\_uint<!-- {{#callable:float_as_uint}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/util/bits/test_bits.c#L10>)

Converts a floating-point number to its equivalent unsigned integer representation by treating the bit pattern of the float as an unsigned integer.
- **Inputs**:
    - `f`: A floating-point number of type `float` to be converted to an unsigned integer.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Declare a union `t` with a `float` member `f` and an `unsigned int` member `u`.
    - Assign the input float `f` to the `float` member `t.f` of the union.
    - Return the `unsigned int` member `t.u` of the union, which now contains the bit pattern of the input float `f`.
- **Output**: An unsigned integer (`uint`) that represents the bit pattern of the input float `f`.


---
### uint\_as\_float<!-- {{#callable:uint_as_float}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/util/bits/test_bits.c#L11>)

Converts an unsigned integer to a floating-point number by treating the integer's bit pattern as a float.
- **Inputs**:
    - ``u``: An unsigned integer whose bit pattern will be interpreted as a floating-point number.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Declare a union `t` with a float `f` and an unsigned integer `u` as members.
    - Assign the input unsigned integer `u` to the union's `u` member.
    - Return the value of the union's `f` member, which interprets the bit pattern of `u` as a float.
- **Output**: A floating-point number that shares the same bit pattern as the input unsigned integer.


---
### double\_as\_ulong<!-- {{#callable:double_as_ulong}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/util/bits/test_bits.c#L14>)

Converts a `double` to its equivalent `ulong` representation by treating the binary bit pattern of the `double` as an `ulong`.
- **Inputs**:
    - `f`: A `double` value to be converted to an `ulong`.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Declare a union `t` with a `double` member `f` and an `ulong` member `u`.
    - Assign the input `double` `f` to the union's `double` member `t.f`.
    - Return the `ulong` member `t.u`, which now contains the bit pattern of the input `double`.
- **Output**: An `ulong` that represents the bit pattern of the input `double`.


---
### ulong\_as\_double<!-- {{#callable:ulong_as_double}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/util/bits/test_bits.c#L15>)

Converts an unsigned long integer to a double by treating the bit pattern of the unsigned long as a double.
- **Inputs**:
    - `u`: An unsigned long integer whose bit pattern will be interpreted as a double.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Declare a union `t` with a double `f` and an unsigned long `u`.
    - Assign the input `u` to the union's unsigned long member `t.u`.
    - Return the double member `t.f` of the union, which now holds the bit pattern of `u` interpreted as a double.
- **Output**: A double that represents the bit pattern of the input unsigned long `u`.


---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/util/bits/test_bits.c#L18>)

Executes a series of tests on various data types and their operations, including bit manipulation, alignment, and mathematical functions, using a random number generator for test data.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments passed to the program.
    - `argv`: An array of strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Calls `fd_boot` to initialize the environment with command-line arguments.
    - Creates a random number generator `rng` using `fd_rng_new` and `fd_rng_join`.
    - Performs tests on `uchar` data type, including power of two checks, bit manipulation, and alignment.
    - Performs similar tests on `ushort`, `uint`, `ulong`, and `uint128` (if supported) data types.
    - Tests `char` and `schar` data types for conditional operations and absolute value calculations.
    - Tests `short`, `int`, and `long` data types for conditional operations, absolute value calculations, and bit shifts.
    - Tests floating-point operations on `float` and `double` (if supported), including NaN and infinity handling.
    - Tests unaligned memory access for various data types using a buffer and random data.
    - Tests integer math functions like square root and cube root approximations.
    - Deletes the random number generator and calls `fd_halt` to terminate the program.
- **Output**: Returns 0 to indicate successful execution.
- **Functions Called**:
    - [`uint_as_float`](<#uint_as_float>)
    - [`float_as_uint`](<#float_as_uint>)
    - [`ulong_as_double`](<#ulong_as_double>)
