Bit manipulation APIs for various data types, including functions for power of two checks, bit masking, alignment, and hashing.

# Purpose
The code is a C header file that provides a comprehensive set of bit manipulation functions and utilities for various data types, including `uchar`, `ushort`, `uint`, `ulong`, and `uint128` (if supported). It defines a series of macros and inline functions for operations such as checking if a number is a power of two, bit masking, setting, clearing, flipping, and extracting bits, as well as more complex operations like bit rotation, alignment, and zig-zag encoding. The file also includes functions for calculating the number of set bits, finding the least and most significant set bits, and byte swapping.

Additionally, the code provides utilities for symmetric variable width encoding and decoding, which are useful for compressing integers into a smaller number of bytes. It also includes macros for compile-time and runtime memory layout calculations, which help in determining the memory footprint of data structures with specific alignment requirements. The file concludes with functions for approximate and exact calculations of square and cube roots for `ulong` values, offering different rounding modes. The header is designed to be included in other C files, providing a broad range of bit manipulation capabilities that can be used in various applications.
