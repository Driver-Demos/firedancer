Tests for floating-point bit manipulation functions in the Firedancer codebase.

# Purpose
The code is a test suite for validating the functionality of floating-point bit manipulation functions. It is an executable C program that tests the conversion between floating-point numbers and their bitwise representations. The program includes tests for both single-precision (`float`) and double-precision (`double`) floating-point numbers, depending on the availability of double-precision support (`FD_HAS_DOUBLE`). The tests verify the correctness of functions that extract and manipulate the sign, exponent, and mantissa components of floating-point numbers, as well as functions that check for special cases like zero, infinity, and NaN (Not a Number).

The program uses a series of macros and test cases to ensure that the functions `fd_fltbits_*` and `fd_dblbits_*` perform as expected. It checks the conversion of floating-point numbers to their bitwise representations and back, ensuring that the operations preserve the original values. The tests also include checks for denormalized numbers and validate the behavior of the functions under various conditions. The program logs a notice of "pass" if all tests are successful and then halts execution.

Tests the conversion and properties of floating-point numbers using custom bit manipulation functions.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments.
    - `argv`: The array of command-line arguments.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Calls `fd_boot` to initialize the environment with command-line arguments.
    - Defines a macro `_` to test various properties of single-precision floating-point numbers using `fd_fltbits` functions.
    - Tests specific floating-point values like `0.f`, `FLT_MIN`, `FLT_EPSILON`, `1.f`, `FLT_MAX`, and their negative counterparts.
    - If `FD_HAS_DOUBLE` is defined, tests similar properties for double-precision floating-point numbers using `fd_dblbits` functions.
    - Performs additional tests to check if certain bit patterns represent zero, infinity, or NaN for both single and double precision.
    - Iterates over possible mantissa and sign values to test denormalized numbers and NaN conditions for single precision.
    - If `FD_HAS_DOUBLE` is defined, performs similar iterations for double precision.
    - Logs a notice message indicating the tests passed.
    - Calls `fd_halt` to terminate the program.
- **Output**: Returns 0 to indicate successful execution.
- **Functions Called**:
    - [`fd_fltbits_is_zero`](<fd_float.h.md#fd_fltbits_is_zero>)
    - [`fd_fltbits_pack`](<fd_float.h.md#fd_fltbits_pack>)
