Tests for 128-bit integer operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and bit shifts.

# Purpose
The code is a C program designed to perform unit tests on a set of operations involving 128-bit unsigned integers (`uint128`). It includes a main function that initializes a random number generator and iteratively tests various arithmetic and bitwise operations on randomly generated 128-bit numbers. The operations tested include addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and bit shifts, as well as finding the most significant bit. The program uses helper functions such as `fd_uwide_add`, `fd_uwide_sub`, `fd_uwide_mul`, `fd_uwide_div`, `fd_uwide_divrem`, `fd_uwide_find_msb`, and `fd_uwide_find_msb_def` to perform these operations and verify their correctness by comparing the results with expected values.

The program is structured to run a large number of iterations, logging progress and errors. It uses inline functions [`split_hi`](<#split_hi>), [`split_lo`](<#split_lo>), and [`join`](<#join>) to manipulate the high and low parts of the 128-bit integers. The code is conditional on the presence of the `FD_HAS_INT128` capability, which indicates support for 128-bit integers. If this capability is not available, the program logs a warning and exits without performing the tests. The program is intended to be executed as a standalone application, as indicated by the presence of the [`main`](<#main>) function, and it does not define any public APIs or external interfaces.
# Imports and Dependencies

# Functions

---
### split\_hi<!-- {{#callable:split_hi}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/util/bits/test_uwide.c#L6>)

Extracts the higher 64 bits from a 128-bit unsigned integer.
- **Inputs**:
    - `x`: A 128-bit unsigned integer (`uint128`) from which the higher 64 bits are extracted.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Shift the input `x` right by 64 bits to move the higher 64 bits to the lower 64-bit position.
    - Cast the result to a 64-bit unsigned long integer (`ulong`).
- **Output**: Returns the higher 64 bits of the input `x` as a 64-bit unsigned long integer (`ulong`).


---
### split\_lo<!-- {{#callable:split_lo}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/util/bits/test_uwide.c#L7>)

Extracts the lower 64 bits from a 128-bit unsigned integer.
- **Inputs**:
    - `x`: A 128-bit unsigned integer (`uint128`) from which the lower 64 bits will be extracted.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Casts the 128-bit unsigned integer `x` to a 64-bit unsigned integer (`ulong`).
- **Output**: Returns the lower 64 bits of the input `x` as a 64-bit unsigned integer (`ulong`).


---
### join<!-- {{#callable:join}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/util/bits/test_uwide.c#L9>)

Combines two 64-bit unsigned long integers into a single 128-bit unsigned integer.
- **Inputs**:
    - `xh`: The high 64 bits of the 128-bit integer.
    - `xl`: The low 64 bits of the 128-bit integer.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Cast `xh` to a 128-bit integer and shift it left by 64 bits to form the high part of the result.
    - Cast `xl` to a 128-bit integer to form the low part of the result.
    - Combine the high and low parts using a bitwise OR operation to form the final 128-bit integer.
- **Output**: A 128-bit unsigned integer that combines the high and low 64-bit parts.


---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/util/bits/test_uwide.c#L193>)

Initializes the environment and logs a warning if the `FD_HAS_INT128` capability is not available, then halts execution.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments.
    - `argv`: An array of command-line arguments.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Calls `fd_boot` to initialize the environment with `argc` and `argv`.
    - Logs a warning message indicating that the unit test requires `FD_HAS_INT128` capability.
    - Calls `fd_halt` to stop the program execution.
    - Returns 0 to indicate successful execution.
- **Output**: Returns 0, indicating successful execution.
