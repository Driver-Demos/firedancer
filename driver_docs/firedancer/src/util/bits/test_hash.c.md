Tests hash functions and their inverses for correctness and avalanche effect.

# Purpose
The code is a C program designed to test the functionality and reliability of hash functions and their inverses. It includes tests for both 32-bit and 64-bit hash functions, specifically `fd_uint_hash`, `fd_uint_hash_inverse`, `fd_ulong_hash`, and `fd_ulong_hash_inverse`. The program verifies that these hash functions produce expected results by comparing the output against predefined reference values (`ref32` and `ref64`). It also checks the correctness of the inverse functions by ensuring that applying a hash function followed by its inverse returns the original value.

Additionally, the program evaluates the avalanche effect of the hash functions, which is a measure of how a small change in input (such as flipping a single bit) results in a significant change in the hash output. This is done by iterating over a large number of pseudo-random inputs and calculating the distribution of bit changes in the hash outputs. The program logs the results and reports any deviations from expected behavior, ensuring that the hash functions exhibit the desired properties of uniformity and randomness. The program uses logging to provide feedback on the progress and results of the tests, and it terminates with a call to `fd_halt()` after all tests pass.

Tests the correctness and avalanche properties of hash functions for 32-bit and 64-bit integers.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments.
    - `argv`: The array of command-line arguments.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Calls `fd_boot` to initialize the environment with command-line arguments.
    - Logs the start of hash sequence testing.
    - Defines reference arrays `ref32` and `ref64` for expected hash values of integers 0 to 9.
    - Iterates over integers 0 to 9, hashes them using `fd_uint_hash` and `fd_ulong_hash`, and checks against reference values `ref32` and `ref64`.
    - Verifies that the inverse hash functions `fd_uint_hash_inverse` and `fd_ulong_hash_inverse` return the original values.
    - Logs the start of avalanche testing for `fd_uint_hash` and `fd_uint_hash_inverse`.
    - Performs avalanche testing by iterating over a large number of pseudo-random integers, calculating hash values, and checking bit fluctuations.
    - Logs the maximum fluctuation and checks if it is within acceptable limits.
    - Repeats avalanche testing for `fd_ulong_hash` and `fd_ulong_hash_inverse`.
    - Logs the completion of tests and calls `fd_halt` to terminate the program.
- **Output**: Returns 0 to indicate successful execution.
