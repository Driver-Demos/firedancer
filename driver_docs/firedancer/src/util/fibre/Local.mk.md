Makefile for building and testing the fd_fibre library and its unit tests on Linux.

# Purpose
The `Makefile` content defines build and test instructions for a software component named `fd_fibre` when certain conditions are met. If both `FD_HAS_HOSTED` and `FD_HAS_LINUX` are defined, it calls a function to create a library for `fd_fibre`, adds `fd_fibre` to the list of objects, and sets up a unit test named `test_fibre` that depends on `fd_fibre` and `fd_util`. It then runs the `test_fibre` unit test.
