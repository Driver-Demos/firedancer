Unit tests for POD (Plain Old Data) utilities, including type validation and memory footprint checks.

# Purpose
The code is a C test suite designed to validate the functionality of a POD (Plain Old Data) management system. It includes a [`main`](<#main>) function that initializes a random number generator and performs a series of tests on various POD operations. The tests cover alignment, footprint calculations, and conversions between string representations and POD value types. The code also tests the insertion, querying, and removal of different data types within the POD, such as buffers, strings, and various integer and floating-point types. The test suite ensures that the POD system correctly handles these operations, including edge cases like invalid inputs and full POD conditions.

The code uses static assertions to verify constant values related to POD error codes and value types. It also includes logging to provide feedback on the test results, such as success or failure messages. The test suite is comprehensive in its coverage of the POD system's functionality, ensuring that the system behaves as expected under various conditions. The code is structured to run multiple iterations of tests, using random data to simulate different scenarios and validate the robustness of the POD management system.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `../fd_util.h`
- `../../util/pod/fd_pod.h`


# Global Variables

---
### mem
- **Type**: ``uchar[]``
- **Description**: An array of unsigned characters with a size of 16384 elements. This array is used as a memory buffer.
- **Use**: Used to allocate and manage memory for operations related to the `fd_pod` functions.


# Functions

---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/util/pod/test_pod.c#L36>)

Executes a series of tests on POD (Plain Old Data) operations, including alignment, footprint, value type conversion, and insertion/removal operations, while logging results and handling command-line arguments.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments.
    - `argv`: An array of strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Initializes the environment and random number generator.
    - Tests POD alignment and footprint for a range of values.
    - Parses the '--max' command-line argument to determine the maximum footprint size.
    - Validates the '--max' value and logs a warning if it is invalid.
    - Performs a series of tests on POD value type conversions using `fd_cstr_to_pod_val_type` and `fd_pod_val_type_to_cstr`.
    - Logs the start of testing with the specified '--max' value.
    - Initializes a POD with the specified maximum size and tests various POD operations, including error string retrieval and iteration over POD elements.
    - Executes a loop to test POD insertion, removal, and querying operations for different value types, including handling of collisions and compacting the POD.
    - Resets the POD and repeats the test loop for a specified number of iterations.
    - Cleans up resources by leaving and deleting the POD and random number generator.
    - Logs the successful completion of tests and halts the program.
- **Output**: Returns 0 upon successful completion of all tests.
