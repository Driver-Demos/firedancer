A Bash script for testing various functionalities of the `fd_pod_ctl` command in the `firedancer` codebase.

# Purpose
The script is a Bash test suite for validating the functionality of the `fd_pod_ctl` command-line tool. It performs a series of tests to ensure that various operations related to "pods" are executed correctly. The script sets up a workspace using `fd_wksp_ctl`, creates temporary files for testing, and then runs a sequence of commands to test different functionalities of `fd_pod_ctl`, such as creating, inserting, updating, setting, querying, listing, removing, resetting, and deleting pods. Each command is tested for both expected success and failure scenarios, and the script uses a `fail` function to handle unexpected outcomes by cleaning up temporary files and exiting with an error message.

The script begins by determining the location of the binaries and setting up the necessary environment variables. It then initializes a workspace and tests the `fd_pod_ctl` tool with various commands. Each command is tested with different parameters to ensure that it behaves as expected. The script checks for correct handling of valid inputs and appropriate error handling for invalid inputs. The `fail` function is used to report unexpected exit codes and clean up resources if a test fails.

The script concludes by cleaning up the workspace and temporary files, ensuring that no residual data is left behind after the tests. The final output indicates whether all tests passed successfully. This script is intended for developers or testers who need to verify the functionality and robustness of the `fd_pod_ctl` tool in managing pods within a specified workspace.
# Global Variables

---
### UNIT\_TEST
- **Type**: ``string``
- **Description**: `UNIT_TEST` is a string variable that stores the directory path of the script's source file. It is determined using the `dirname` command on the special variable `$BASH_SOURCE`, which contains the path of the currently executing script.
- **Use**: Stores the directory path of the script's source file for use in determining the build and binary paths.


---
### BUILD
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: Represents the directory path where the build binaries are located. It is determined by finding the directory name of the `UNIT_TEST` variable, which is derived from the script's source path.
- **Use**: Used to construct the path to the `bin` directory where executable binaries are stored.


---
### BIN
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: `BIN` is a string variable that stores the path to the 'bin' directory within the build directory. It is constructed by appending '/bin' to the `BUILD` variable, which represents the directory containing unit tests.
- **Use**: Used to specify the location of binary files for executing various commands in the script.


---
### WKSP
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: The `WKSP` variable is a string that specifies the name of a workspace file used in the script. It is set to 'test_fd_pod_ctl.wksp' and is used in various commands to manage the workspace.
- **Use**: Used to specify the workspace file name for operations in the script.


---
### PAGE\_CNT
- **Type**: `integer`
- **Description**: Specifies the number of pages to use when creating a new workspace with the `fd_wksp_ctl` command. It is set to 1, indicating that the workspace will consist of a single page.
- **Use**: Used as an argument in the `fd_wksp_ctl new` command to define the size of the workspace in terms of pages.


---
### PAGE\_SZ
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: The `PAGE_SZ` variable is a global variable defined in the script with the value 'gigantic'. It is used to specify the size of a page in the context of workspace operations.
- **Use**: Used as an argument for workspace creation commands to define the page size.


---
### CPU\_IDX
- **Type**: `integer`
- **Description**: This variable is an integer that represents the index of the CPU to use for a specific operation or configuration. It is set to 0, indicating the first CPU or a default CPU index.
- **Use**: Used as a parameter in the `fd_wksp_ctl` command to specify the CPU index for workspace operations.


---
### MODE
- **Type**: ``int``
- **Description**: `MODE` is a global variable that stores the file permission mode for a workspace. It is set to `0600`, which means the file is readable and writable by the owner only.
- **Use**: Used to specify the file permission mode when creating a new workspace with the `fd_wksp_ctl` command.


---
### BADFILE
- **Type**: ``string``
- **Description**: `BADFILE` is a global variable that stores the path to a temporary file created using the `mktemp` command. The script immediately deletes this file after its creation with the `rm -f` command.
- **Use**: Used to create and reference a temporary file that is immediately deleted, likely for testing or placeholder purposes.


---
### EMPTYFILE
- **Type**: ``string``
- **Description**: `EMPTYFILE` is a global variable that stores the path to a temporary file created using the `mktemp` command. This file is intended to be empty and is used in various test operations within the script.
- **Use**: Used to store the path of an empty temporary file for testing purposes.


---
### TMPFILE
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: `TMPFILE` is a global variable that stores the path to a temporary file created using the `mktemp` command. This file is initialized with the text 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog'. The file is used during the script's execution and is deleted at the end of the script.
- **Use**: Stores the path to a temporary file used for testing and operations within the script.


---
### FD\_LOG\_PATH
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: The `FD_LOG_PATH` variable is a global string variable that is initialized to an empty string. It is used to disable the permanent log by not specifying a log path.
- **Use**: Used to control logging behavior by setting it to an empty string, effectively disabling logging.


---
### POD
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: The `POD` variable stores the output of the command that creates a new pod using the `fd_pod_ctl` utility. This command is executed with the workspace name and a size parameter, and the result is captured in `POD`. The variable is used to reference the newly created pod in subsequent operations.
- **Use**: Used to store and reference the identifier of a newly created pod for further operations.


# Functions

---
### fail
Handles unexpected exit codes by cleaning up temporary files, printing an error message, and exiting the script.
- **Inputs**:
    - `$1`: A string representing the context or name of the operation that failed.
    - `$2`: An integer representing the unexpected exit code of the operation.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Remove the files specified by the variables `EMPTYFILE` and `TMPFILE` using the `rm -f` command.
    - Print an error message to standard output that includes the string 'FAIL:', the context of the failure (`$1`), and the unexpected exit code (`$2`).
    - Print 'Log N/A' to standard output.
    - Terminate the script with an exit status of 1 using the `exit` command.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it exits the script with a status code of 1.
