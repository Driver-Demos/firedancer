A non-cryptographic pseudo-random number generator supporting parallel generation, shared memory, and various random number distributions.

# Purpose
The code defines a non-cryptographic pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) in C, designed for high performance and quality. It supports parallel generation, interprocess shared memory usage, checkpointing, random access, and reversibility. The PRNG is implemented in a header file, which suggests it is intended to be included and used in other C source files. The generator uses a 64-bit integer hash function to produce random numbers and provides a variety of functions to generate random integers and floating-point numbers of different sizes and distributions.

The code defines an opaque handle `fd_rng_t` for the PRNG state, which is aligned and has a specific memory footprint. Functions are provided to initialize ([`fd_rng_new`](<#fd_rng_new>)), join ([`fd_rng_join`](<#fd_rng_join>)), leave ([`fd_rng_leave`](<#fd_rng_leave>)), and delete ([`fd_rng_delete`](<#fd_rng_delete>)) the PRNG state. The generator can produce random numbers in various formats, including unsigned and signed integers, floats, and doubles, with specific functions for each type. Additionally, the code includes functions for generating random numbers with specific distributions, such as uniform, exponential, and normal distributions. The code also provides a secure random byte generator function, [`fd_rng_secure`](<#fd_rng_secure>), which reads random bytes from a cryptographically secure source, ensuring unguessable random bytes are produced.

- **Members**:
    - ``seq``: A 64-bit unsigned long integer representing the sequence of the random number generator.
    - ``idx``: A 64-bit unsigned long integer representing the index or position in the random number sequence.
- **Description**: `fd_rng_t` is a structure that serves as an opaque handle for a pseudo-random number generator. It contains two members: `seq`, which is used to store the sequence identifier for the random number generation, and `idx`, which tracks the current position in the sequence. This structure is designed to facilitate operations such as parallel generation, interprocess shared memory usage, and reversible random access, while maintaining high-quality randomness for non-cryptographic purposes.
