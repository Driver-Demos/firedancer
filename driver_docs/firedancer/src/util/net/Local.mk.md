Makefile for adding headers, building objects, and running unit and fuzz tests for network utilities.

# Purpose
The provided content is a Makefile script used to automate the build and testing process for a software project. It defines a series of commands to add header files and object files, and to create and run unit tests for various components such as `fd_eth`, `fd_ip4`, `fd_ip6`, `fd_igmp`, `fd_udp`, and `fd_pcap`. The script uses the `add-hdrs` and `add-objs` functions to manage dependencies and compile the necessary files. It also includes conditional logic with `ifdef FD_HAS_HOSTED` to execute additional tests, such as `test_pcapng` and fuzz tests for `fuzz_pcap` and `fuzz_pcapng`, if the `FD_HAS_HOSTED` variable is defined. This setup ensures that the software components are correctly built and tested in a consistent manner.
