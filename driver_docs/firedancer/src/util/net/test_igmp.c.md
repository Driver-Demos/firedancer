Tests for IGMP data structures and their memory layout in the Firedancer codebase.

# Purpose
This code is a C test suite designed to validate the structure and integrity of IGMP (Internet Group Management Protocol) related data types and constants. It includes static assertions to verify that specific IGMP type constants match expected values and that the sizes of the `fd_igmp_t` and `fd_ip4_igmp_t` structures are as intended. The [`main`](<#main>) function initializes the test environment and performs a series of tests to ensure that the offsets of the fields within the `fd_igmp_t` and `fd_ip4_igmp_t` structures are correct. The code includes placeholders for additional tests, indicated by `FIXME` comments, suggesting further validation is needed for `FD_IGMP_CHECK` and `FD_IP4_IGMP`. Upon successful completion of the tests, a log message indicates a pass, and the program terminates cleanly.
# Imports and Dependencies

- `../fd_util.h`
- `fd_igmp.h`

### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/util/net/test_igmp.c#L12>)

Initializes the system, performs static assertions on IGMP structure offsets, logs a success message, and halts the system.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The count of command-line arguments.
    - `argv`: The array of command-line argument strings.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Calls `fd_boot` to initialize the system with command-line arguments.
    - Performs a series of `FD_TEST` assertions to verify the memory offsets of fields within the `fd_igmp_t` and `fd_ip4_igmp_t` structures.
    - Logs a notice message 'pass' using `FD_LOG_NOTICE`.
    - Calls `fd_halt` to terminate the program.
    - Returns 0 to indicate successful execution.
- **Output**: Returns 0 to indicate successful execution.
