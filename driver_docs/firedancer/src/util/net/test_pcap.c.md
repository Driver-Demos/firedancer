A unit test for reading and writing pcap files, including command-line argument handling and validation.

# Purpose
The code is a C program designed to process and analyze packet capture (PCAP) files. It includes functionality to read packets from an input stream, which can be specified via command-line arguments or default to standard input. The program can also write a specified number of packets to an output file if the `--out` and `--max` options are provided. The code uses the `fd_pcap_iter_t` iterator to traverse the packets in the PCAP file, checking for specific conditions such as packet size and type. It logs various notices and warnings during execution, such as when a packet is too small or when the input or output streams are opened or closed.

The program also includes a test suite that verifies the functionality of the PCAP iterator using a binary PCAP file imported as `simple_pcap`. It checks the correctness of packet headers and payloads by comparing them against expected values. The code is structured to run only if the `FD_HAS_HOSTED` macro is defined, indicating that it is intended to be executed in a hosted environment. If this condition is not met, the program logs a notice and exits. The code is part of a larger system, as indicated by the inclusion of headers like `fd_util.h` and `fd_pcap.h`, and it uses several utility functions for environment setup, logging, and error handling.
# Imports and Dependencies

[View Source →](<../../../../../src/util/net/test_pcap.c#L107>)

Initializes the environment and logs a message indicating that the unit test is skipped due to the absence of `FD_HAS_HOSTED`, then halts the program.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The count of command-line arguments.
    - `argv`: The array of command-line arguments.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Calls `fd_boot` to initialize the environment with the provided command-line arguments.
    - Logs a notice message indicating that the unit test is skipped because `FD_HAS_HOSTED` is not defined.
    - Calls `fd_halt` to terminate the program.
- **Output**: Returns 0 to indicate successful execution.
