Fuzz testing for pcap file parsing using LLVM's libFuzzer.

# Purpose
The code is a fuzz testing module designed to test the functionality of packet capture (pcap) processing. It is intended to be used with LLVM's libFuzzer, a library for coverage-guided fuzz testing. The module includes two main functions: [`LLVMFuzzerInitialize`](<#llvmfuzzerinitialize>) and [`LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`](<#llvmfuzzertestoneinput>). The [`LLVMFuzzerInitialize`](<#llvmfuzzerinitialize>) function sets up the environment by disabling signal handlers, configuring logging, and registering a cleanup function to be called at program exit. The [`LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`](<#llvmfuzzertestoneinput>) function is the core of the fuzz testing process. It takes a data buffer and its size as input, and uses `fmemopen` to create a file stream from the buffer. The function then initializes a pcap iterator to process packets from the file stream, iterating over each packet until all packets are processed. The function ensures that resources are properly released by closing the file and deleting the pcap iterator.

The module includes several header files, such as `stdio.h`, `stdlib.h`, and `unistd.h`, as well as custom headers like `fd_util.h`, `fd_fuzz.h`, and `fd_pcap.h`. It uses macros like `FD_TEST`, `FD_LIKELY`, and `FD_UNLIKELY` to handle error checking and optimize branch prediction. The code is structured to ensure that all paths in the pcap processing logic are covered during fuzz testing, as indicated by the `FD_FUZZ_MUST_BE_COVERED` macro. The module is designed to be compiled and run in a hosted environment, as indicated by the preprocessor directive checking for `FD_HAS_HOSTED`.

# Functions

---
### LLVMFuzzerInitialize<!-- {{#callable:LLVMFuzzerInitialize}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/util/net/fuzz_pcap.c#L13>)

Initializes the fuzzer environment by setting environment variables, booting the system, and configuring logging.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: A pointer to the argument count, typically passed to the main function.
    - `argv`: A pointer to the argument vector, typically passed to the main function.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Set the environment variable `FD_LOG_BACKTRACE` to `0` to disable backtrace logging.
    - Call `fd_boot` with `argc` and `argv` to initialize the system.
    - Register `fd_halt` to be called at program exit using `atexit`.
    - Set the logging level for standard error to `4` using `fd_log_level_stderr_set`.
    - Return `0` to indicate successful initialization.
- **Output**: Returns `0` to indicate successful initialization.

### LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput<!-- {{#callable:LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/util/net/fuzz_pcap.c#L26>)

Processes input data as a pcap file and iterates over its packets.
- **Inputs**:
    - `data`: A pointer to the input data to be processed.
    - `size`: The size of the input data in bytes.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Check if `size` is zero; if so, return 0 immediately.
    - Open a memory stream using `fmemopen` with the input data and size.
    - Verify the file stream is successfully opened using `FD_TEST`.
    - Create a new pcap iterator using `fd_pcap_iter_new` with the file stream.
    - If the pcap iterator is successfully created, iterate over all packets using `fd_pcap_iter_next`.
    - Delete the pcap iterator using `fd_pcap_iter_delete` and verify it is successfully deleted.
    - Close the file stream using `fclose` and verify it is successfully closed.
- **Output**: Returns 0 after processing the input data.
