Tests for UDP header alignment, size, and field offsets in the Firedancer codebase.

# Purpose
This code is a C program designed to perform static and runtime tests on UDP and IP header structures. It includes header files for utility functions and network headers, and uses `FD_STATIC_ASSERT` to verify the alignment and size of `fd_udp_hdr_t` and `fd_ip4_udp_hdrs_t` structures at compile time. The [`main`](<#main>) function initializes the environment with `fd_boot`, then uses `FD_TEST` to check the offsets of various fields within the `fd_udp_hdr_t` structure to ensure they match expected values. The program logs a notice indicating the tests have passed and concludes by calling `fd_halt` to clean up before exiting. There is a placeholder comment indicating a need to implement a test for `FD_IP4_UDP_CHECK`.

[View Source →](<../../../../../src/util/net/test_udp.c#L15>)

Initializes the environment, performs static assertions on UDP header offsets, logs a success message, and halts the program.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The count of command-line arguments.
    - `argv`: The array of command-line arguments.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Call `fd_boot` to initialize the environment with command-line arguments.
    - Perform static assertions using `FD_TEST` to verify the offsets of fields in the `fd_udp_hdr_t` structure.
    - Log a notice message 'pass' using `FD_LOG_NOTICE`.
    - Call `fd_halt` to terminate the program.
    - Return 0 to indicate successful execution.
- **Output**: Returns 0 to indicate successful execution.
