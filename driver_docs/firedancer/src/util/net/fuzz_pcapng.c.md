Fuzz testing for pcapng file parsing with LLVM fuzzer integration.

# Purpose
The code is a fuzz testing module designed for use with LLVM's libFuzzer. It initializes a fuzzing environment and tests the processing of pcapng (Packet Capture Next Generation) data. The [`LLVMFuzzerInitialize`](<#llvmfuzzerinitialize>) function sets up the environment by configuring logging settings and initializing necessary resources. It uses `fd_boot` to start the environment and registers `fd_halt` to be called upon program exit. The [`LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`](<#llvmfuzzertestoneinput>) function is the core of the fuzzing process, which takes input data, simulates a pcapng file stream, and iterates over frames in the stream to test the handling of various fields and data sizes.

The module includes several components from external libraries, such as `fd_util.h`, `fd_fuzz.h`, and `fd_pcapng_private.h`, which provide utility functions, fuzzing support, and pcapng-specific operations, respectively. The code constructs a fake pcapng state with a single Ethernet interface and iterates over frames using `fd_pcapng_iter_next`. It performs operations on each frame to ensure that all fields are accessed and that the data size does not exceed predefined limits. The use of `FD_TEST` and `FD_FUZZ_MUST_BE_COVERED` ensures that the code checks for expected conditions and coverage during fuzz testing.

# Functions

---
### LLVMFuzzerInitialize<!-- {{#callable:LLVMFuzzerInitialize}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/util/net/fuzz_pcapng.c#L13>)

Initializes the fuzzer environment by setting environment variables, booting the system, and registering an exit function.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: A pointer to the argument count, typically from the command line.
    - `argv`: A pointer to the argument vector, typically from the command line.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Set the environment variable `FD_LOG_BACKTRACE` to `0` to disable backtrace logging.
    - Set the environment variable `FD_LOG_PATH` to an empty string to disable logging to a file.
    - Call `fd_boot` with `argc` and `argv` to initialize the system.
    - Register the `fd_halt` function to be called at program exit using `atexit`.
    - Set the logging level for standard error to `4` using `fd_log_level_stderr_set`.
    - Return `0` to indicate successful initialization.
- **Output**: Returns `0` to indicate successful initialization.

### LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput<!-- {{#callable:LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/util/net/fuzz_pcapng.c#L27>)

Processes input data as a pcapng stream and iterates over frames to perform basic operations.
- **Inputs**:
    - `data`: A pointer to the input data to be processed as a pcapng stream.
    - `data_sz`: The size of the input data in bytes.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Check if `data_sz` is zero; if true, open `/dev/null` as a file, otherwise use `fmemopen` to open the data as a file stream.
    - Initialize a `fd_pcapng_iter_t` structure with a fake pcapng state, including a single interface with predefined options.
    - Enter an infinite loop to iterate over frames using `fd_pcapng_iter_next`.
    - Break the loop if no more frames are available.
    - For each frame, read and forget the values of `type`, `ts`, `orig_sz`, and `if_idx`.
    - Verify that `frame->data_sz` does not exceed `FD_PCAPNG_FRAME_SZ`.
    - Compute a checksum by XORing all bytes in `frame->data` and forget the result.
    - Close the file stream and ensure it closes successfully.
    - Ensure that the code path is covered by fuzzing checks using `FD_FUZZ_MUST_BE_COVERED`.
- **Output**: Returns 0 after processing the input data.
