Makefile for adding headers, objects, and unit tests for `fd_spad` and `fd_util`.

# Purpose
The Makefile script defines build and test instructions for a software project. It adds the header file `fd_spad.h` and object files `fd_spad` and `fd_util` to the build process. It also specifies a unit test named `test_spad`, which depends on the `fd_util` object, and includes instructions to execute this unit test.
