Makefile for adding headers, creating a library, and setting flags for sanitization and fuzzing.

# Purpose
This Makefile snippet defines build rules and configurations for a software project. It uses the `add-hdrs` function to include header files `fd_asan.h`, `fd_msan.h`, and `fd_sanitize.h`. The `make-lib` function creates a library named `fd_fuzz_stub`, and the `add-objs` function adds the object file `fd_fuzz_stub` to the build. If the `FD_HAS_DEEPASAN_WATCH` variable is defined, the `CPPFLAGS` are updated to define `FD_HAS_DEEPASAN_WATCH` with a value of 1, and additional object files `fd_asan` and `fd_backtrace` are added to the `fd_util` library.
