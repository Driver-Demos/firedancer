A canary file for testing the canary finder in the fuzzing process.

# Purpose
This code defines a canary function intended for use with a canary finder script. The function [`do_not_call_me`](<#do_not_call_me>) is marked with the macro `FD_FUZZ_MUST_BE_COVERED`, which indicates that the canary finder should detect this function during its operation. The presence of this canary helps verify that the canary finder script is functioning correctly. If the script does not find this canary, it will treat the situation as a failure. This code is not a unit test but serves as a mechanism to ensure the reliability of the canary detection process.
# Imports and Dependencies
