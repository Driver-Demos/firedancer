Header file for printing a backtrace to a specified file descriptor.

# Purpose
This is a C header file that declares a function for printing a backtrace. The function [`fd_backtrace_print`](<#fd_backtrace_print>) takes an integer `fd` as a parameter, which typically represents a file descriptor. The purpose of this function is to output a backtrace to the specified file descriptor, which can be useful for debugging by providing a stack trace of the program's execution. The header file uses include guards to prevent multiple inclusions, ensuring that the function declaration is only processed once during compilation.

### fd\_backtrace\_print<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_backtrace_print}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/util/sanitize/fd_backtrace.h#L4>)

Prints a backtrace to a file descriptor.
- **Description**: Use this function to print a backtrace of the current call stack to a specified file descriptor. This is useful for debugging purposes, especially when diagnosing crashes or unexpected behavior. Ensure that the file descriptor is valid and open for writing before calling this function. The function does not validate the file descriptor, so invalid descriptors can lead to undefined behavior.
- **Inputs**:
    - `fd`: An integer representing the file descriptor where the backtrace will be printed. Must be a valid file descriptor open for writing. The function does not check the validity of the file descriptor, and using an invalid one can cause undefined behavior.
- **Output**: None
- **See Also**: [`fd_backtrace_print`](<fd_backtrace.c.md#fd_backtrace_print>)  (Implementation)
