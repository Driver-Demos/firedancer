APIs for compiler sanitizers to detect errors like out-of-bounds memory access and undefined behavior.

# Purpose
This code is a C header file that provides an interface for compiler sanitizers. Compiler sanitizers are tools that help detect errors in programs by using hardware features, code hooks, special memory mappings, and library functions. The header file includes other headers, `fd_asan.h` and `fd_msan.h`, which likely contain specific implementations or configurations for different types of sanitizers, such as AddressSanitizer and MemorySanitizer. These sanitizers are used to identify issues like out-of-bounds memory accesses and other undefined behaviors in compiled code. The header guards prevent multiple inclusions of this file, ensuring that the declarations are only processed once by the compiler.
