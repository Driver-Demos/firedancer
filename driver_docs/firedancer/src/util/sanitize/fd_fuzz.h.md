Header file for fuzz testing with a function prototype for LLVMFuzzerMutate.

# Purpose
This code is a C header file that provides a function prototype and a macro definition for use in fuzz testing. The macro `FD_FUZZ_MUST_BE_COVERED` is conditionally defined based on whether `FD_HAS_COVERAGE` is set, allowing for coverage tracking during fuzz testing. The function [`LLVMFuzzerMutate`](<#llvmfuzzermutate>) is declared to mutate input data for fuzzing purposes, taking a pointer to the data, its current size, and a maximum size as parameters. The header file includes a base utility header `fd_util_base.h` and uses include guards to prevent multiple inclusions.

[View Source →](<../../../../../src/util/sanitize/fd_fuzz.h#L12>)

Mutates input data for fuzz testing.
- **Description**: Use this function to modify the input data buffer for fuzz testing purposes. It is intended to be used in environments where fuzz testing is performed, and it is expected to be overridden by a custom implementation. The function does not perform any mutation by default and returns zero. Ensure that the `data` buffer is writable and that `data_sz` does not exceed `max_sz`. This function is typically used in conjunction with fuzzing tools that provide their own mutation logic.
- **Inputs**:
    - `data`: A pointer to a buffer of unsigned characters that will be mutated. The buffer must be writable and must not be null.
    - `data_sz`: The current size of the data in the buffer. It must be less than or equal to `max_sz`.
    - `max_sz`: The maximum size that the data buffer can grow to during mutation. It must be greater than or equal to `data_sz`.
- **Output**: Returns zero by default, indicating no mutation was performed. In a custom implementation, it would typically return the new size of the mutated data.
