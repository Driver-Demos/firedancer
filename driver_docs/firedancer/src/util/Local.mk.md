Makefile for building and testing the `fd_util` library with unit and fuzz tests.

# Purpose
The `Makefile` content defines build and test instructions for the `fd_util` library. It uses a series of `make` function calls to organize the compilation and testing process. The `make-lib` function call creates the `fd_util` library, while `add-hdrs` and `add-objs` specify the header and object files associated with it. The `make-unit-test` and `run-unit-test` function calls set up and execute unit tests for `test_util` and, conditionally, `test_util_base`, which checks compatibility with the FD machine model. The `ifndef FD_HAS_UBSAN` block prevents the building of `test_util_base` under undefined behavior sanitizer (UBSAN) conditions, as it is expected to fail by design. Additionally, if `FD_HAS_HOSTED` is defined, a fuzz test for `fuzz_hash` is created and executed.
