Makefile for adding headers, objects, and unit tests for `fd_cstr` in the `firedancer` codebase.

# Purpose
The Makefile content defines build and test instructions for a software project. It adds the header file `fd_cstr.h` and object files `fd_cstr` and `fd_util` to the build process. It also specifies a unit test named `test_cstr`, which uses the `fd_util` object, and includes instructions to run this unit test.
