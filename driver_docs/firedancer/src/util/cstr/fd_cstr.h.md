APIs for manipulating null-terminated character strings, including conversion, hashing, and tokenization functions.

# Purpose
The code is a C header file that provides a collection of functions and macros for manipulating and processing null-terminated character strings, commonly referred to as "cstr". It includes functions for converting cstr to various data types, such as integers and floating-point numbers, and for handling string sequences and tokenization. The file also provides functions for hashing strings, comparing strings case-insensitively, and determining the length of strings without relying on POSIX support. Additionally, it includes functions for formatted output to strings, appending characters or strings to existing strings, and encoding Unicode code points into UTF-8.

The header file defines a set of macros that ensure the return values of `ctype.h` functions are strictly 0 or 1, addressing potential inconsistencies in standard library implementations. This file is intended to be included in other C source files, providing a broad range of utilities for string manipulation and conversion. It does not define a main function or executable code but rather serves as a library of functions and macros to be used in other parts of a program. The file also includes conditional compilation directives to handle platform-specific features, such as support for double precision floating-point numbers and 128-bit integers.

### fd\_cstr\_to\_ulong\_octal<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_cstr_to_ulong_octal}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/util/cstr/fd_cstr.h#L54>)

Converts a null-terminated string to an unsigned long integer assuming octal format.
- **Description**: Use this function to convert a null-terminated string representing an octal number into an unsigned long integer. This is useful when parsing strings that represent UNIX-style file permissions or other octal-based data. The input string must not be null and should be a valid octal representation. The function ignores leading whitespace and handles leading signs. If the string is not a valid octal number, the behavior is undefined.
- **Inputs**:
    - `s`: A pointer to a null-terminated string representing an octal number. Must not be null. The caller retains ownership of the string.
- **Output**: Returns the unsigned long integer value of the octal number represented by the input string.

### fd\_cstr\_to\_ulong\_seq<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_cstr_to_ulong_seq}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/util/cstr/fd_cstr.h#L70>)

Parses a string into a sequence of unsigned long integers.
- **Description**: Use this function to convert a comma-separated list of ranges in a string into a sequence of unsigned long integers. The input string can contain individual numbers, ranges (e.g., "4-8"), or ranges with a stride (e.g., "1-10/3"). The function ignores whitespace and handles overflow conditions. If the input string is malformed or null, the function returns 0, and the sequence may be partially filled or unchanged. Ensure the sequence array is non-null if the maximum sequence length is non-zero.
- **Inputs**:
    - `cstr`: A null-terminated string representing a sequence of numbers and ranges. Can be null, which results in a return value of 0.
    - `seq`: An array of unsigned long integers to store the parsed sequence. Must be non-null if `seq_max` is non-zero. The caller retains ownership.
    - `seq_max`: The maximum number of elements that `seq` can hold. Determines the truncation point if the parsed sequence exceeds this length.
- **Output**: Returns the actual number of elements parsed into the sequence. If greater than `seq_max`, the sequence is truncated.

### fd\_cstr\_casecmp<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_cstr_casecmp}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/util/cstr/fd_cstr.h#L107>)

Compares two strings ignoring case differences.
- **Description**: Use this function to compare two null-terminated strings in a case-insensitive manner. It is useful when the case of the characters should not affect the comparison result. The function assumes both input strings are valid and null-terminated. It returns an integer less than, equal to, or greater than zero if the first string is found, respectively, to be less than, to match, or be greater than the second string. This function does not modify the input strings.
- **Inputs**:
    - `a`: A pointer to the first null-terminated string to compare. Must not be null.
    - `b`: A pointer to the second null-terminated string to compare. Must not be null.
- **Output**: An integer indicating the result of the comparison: less than zero if 'a' is less than 'b', zero if they are equal, and greater than zero if 'a' is greater than 'b'.

### fd\_cstr\_nlen<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_cstr_nlen}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/util/cstr/fd_cstr.h#L114>)

Determines the length of a string up to a maximum limit.
- **Description**: Use this function to find the length of a null-terminated string, but not exceeding a specified maximum number of characters. This is useful when you need to ensure that the length calculation does not go beyond a certain limit, which can help prevent buffer overflows. The function does not require POSIX support and is equivalent to `strnlen`. It is important to ensure that the input string is properly null-terminated within the specified maximum length to avoid undefined behavior.
- **Inputs**:
    - `s`: A pointer to the null-terminated string to measure. Must not be null, and the string should be properly terminated within the first `m` characters.
    - `m`: The maximum number of characters to examine in the string. Must be a non-negative value.
- **Output**: Returns the number of characters in the string, excluding the null terminator, up to a maximum of `m` characters.

### fd\_cstr\_printf<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_cstr_printf}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/util/cstr/fd_cstr.h#L138>)

Formats a string into a buffer with a specified size.
- **Description**: Use this function to format a string into a provided buffer, ensuring that the resulting string is null-terminated and does not exceed the specified buffer size. This function is useful when you need to safely format strings with variable arguments into a fixed-size buffer. If the buffer is null or the size is zero, the function performs no operation and returns the buffer unchanged. The function can also optionally return the length of the formatted string through a pointer. It is important to ensure that the buffer is large enough to hold the formatted string and the null terminator to avoid truncation.
- **Inputs**:
    - `buf`: A pointer to the buffer where the formatted string will be stored. Must not be null unless size is zero.
    - `sz`: The size of the buffer in bytes. Must be greater than zero to perform formatting.
    - `opt_len`: An optional pointer to a ulong where the function will store the length of the formatted string. Can be null if the length is not needed.
    - `fmt`: A format string that specifies how to format the subsequent arguments. Must not be null.
- **Output**: Returns the pointer to the buffer `buf`. If `opt_len` is provided, it will contain the length of the formatted string.
- **See Also**: [`fd_cstr_printf`](<fd_cstr.c.md#fd_cstr_printf>)  (Implementation)

### fd\_cstr\_printf\_check<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_cstr_printf_check}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/util/cstr/fd_cstr.h#L153>)

Formats a string into a buffer and checks if it fits.
- **Description**: Use this function to format a string into a buffer and verify if the entire formatted string, including the null terminator, fits within the buffer. It is useful when you need to ensure that the formatted output does not exceed the buffer size. If the buffer is null or the size is zero, the function does nothing and returns 0. The function can also provide the length of the formatted string through an optional parameter. It returns 1 if the string fits completely, otherwise 0.
- **Inputs**:
    - `buf`: A pointer to the buffer where the formatted string will be written. Must not be null unless size is zero.
    - `sz`: The size of the buffer. Must be greater than zero for the function to perform formatting.
    - `opt_len`: An optional pointer to store the length of the formatted string. Can be null if the length is not needed.
    - `fmt`: A format string as in printf. Must not be null.
    - `...`: Additional arguments for the format string. Must match the format specifiers in the format string.
- **Output**: Returns 1 if the entire formatted string fits in the buffer, including the null terminator; otherwise, returns 0. If opt_len is provided, it will contain the length of the formatted string.
- **See Also**: [`fd_cstr_printf_check`](<fd_cstr.c.md#fd_cstr_printf_check>)  (Implementation)

### fd\_cstr\_append\_printf<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_cstr_append_printf}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/util/cstr/fd_cstr.h#L221>)

Appends formatted text to a buffer.
- **Description**: Use this function to append formatted text to a given buffer using a format string and additional arguments. The buffer must be non-null and have enough space to accommodate the formatted text and a terminating null character. If the buffer is null, the function returns null. This function is useful for constructing strings dynamically by appending formatted data.
- **Inputs**:
    - `buf`: A pointer to the buffer where the formatted text will be appended. Must not be null and should have enough space for the resulting string.
    - `fmt`: A format string that specifies how to format the subsequent arguments. Must not be null.
- **Output**: Returns a pointer to the position in the buffer immediately after the appended text, or null if the buffer is null.
- **See Also**: [`fd_cstr_append_printf`](<fd_cstr.c.md#fd_cstr_append_printf>)  (Implementation)

### fd\_cstr\_tokenize<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_cstr_tokenize}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/util/cstr/fd_cstr.h#L379>)

Tokenizes a string into substrings based on a delimiter.
- **Description**: Use this function to split a null-terminated string into tokens separated by a specified delimiter. The function modifies the input string in place, replacing delimiters with null characters to terminate each token. It stores pointers to the start of each token in the provided array, up to the specified maximum number of tokens. The function returns the total number of tokens found, which may exceed the maximum if the array is too small. The input string must not be null, and the delimiter must be a non-null, non-whitespace character.
- **Inputs**:
    - `tok`: An array of character pointers where the function will store the addresses of the tokens. The array must have space for at least 'tok_max' elements. The caller retains ownership.
    - `tok_max`: The maximum number of tokens to store in the 'tok' array. Must be a non-negative integer.
    - `cstr`: A null-terminated string to tokenize. The string is modified in place, so it must be writable. Must not be null.
    - `delim`: A character used to separate tokens in the string. Must be a non-null, non-whitespace character.
- **Output**: Returns the total number of tokens found in the string. If this number is greater than 'tok_max', only the first 'tok_max' tokens are stored in 'tok'.
- **See Also**: [`fd_cstr_tokenize`](<fd_cstr.c.md#fd_cstr_tokenize>)  (Implementation)
