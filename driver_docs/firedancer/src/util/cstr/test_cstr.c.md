Tests for various C string operations, including conversion, formatting, and tokenization functions.

# Purpose
The code is a C program that serves as a test suite for various string manipulation and conversion functions. It includes tests for functions that handle string formatting, conversion between strings and numeric types, and string tokenization. The program uses a random number generator to create test cases for these functions, ensuring that they handle a wide range of input values correctly. The code also includes tests for UTF-8 encoding and character classification functions, verifying that these functions return expected results for different character inputs.

The program is structured to perform a series of tests, each focusing on a specific function or set of functions. It uses macros and predefined reference strings to validate the output of the functions being tested. The code includes a main function that initializes the test environment, runs the tests, and logs the results. The tests cover a variety of scenarios, including edge cases, to ensure the robustness of the functions. The program is intended to be executed as a standalone application, and it does not define any public APIs or external interfaces.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `../fd_util.h`
- `ctype.h`


# Global Variables

---
### ref\_text
- **Type**: ``char const *``
- **Description**: A constant character pointer that points to a string containing two sentences: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" repeated twice, separated by newlines.
- **Use**: Used as a reference text for string operations or tests.


---
### ref\_uchar
- **Type**: ``char const *``
- **Description**: A string that contains various representations of unsigned char values, including positive and negative signs, and different formats such as leading spaces and zeros. The values range from 0 to 255, which are typical for an unsigned char data type.
- **Use**: Used to provide reference data for testing or validation of unsigned char representations.


---
### ref\_ushort
- **Type**: ``char const *``
- **Description**: A constant character pointer that holds a string of newline-separated numeric values. These values represent various representations of unsigned short integers, including positive, negative, and zero values, with and without leading signs and spaces.
- **Use**: Used to provide reference data for testing or validation of unsigned short integer conversions or representations.


---
### ref\_uint
- **Type**: ``char const *``
- **Description**: Contains a string of newline-separated unsigned integer values, including positive, negative, and zero values, formatted in various ways (e.g., with leading zeros, with signs).
- **Use**: Used as a reference for testing or validating functions that process or convert unsigned integer strings.


---
### ref\_ulong
- **Type**: ``char const *``
- **Description**: Contains a string of newline-separated unsigned long integer values in various formats, including positive, negative, and zero values. The string includes numbers with and without leading zeros and signs.
- **Use**: Used as a reference for testing or validating functions that process or convert string representations of unsigned long integers.


---
### ref\_uint128\_frag
- **Type**: ``char const *[4]``
- **Description**: Contains four string fragments that represent a sequence of unsigned 128-bit integer values in various formats. The strings are split to avoid compiler warnings about overlength strings.
- **Use**: Used to store and manage large sequences of unsigned 128-bit integer values as string fragments.


---
### ref\_uint128
- **Type**: ``char` array`
- **Description**: A `char` array with a size of 7041 bytes. It is used to store a sequence of characters, likely representing a large number or a series of numbers in text form.
- **Use**: Used to store and manipulate large numeric values as strings, possibly for testing or conversion purposes.


---
### ref\_fxp10
- **Type**: ``char const *[4]``
- **Description**: An array of four constant character pointers, each pointing to a string that represents numbers in fixed-point decimal format with varying precision levels. The strings contain numbers formatted with different numbers of decimal places, ranging from zero to nine decimal places.
- **Use**: Used to store and provide access to fixed-point decimal representations of numbers for different precision levels.


# Functions

---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/util/cstr/test_cstr.c#L25>)

Executes a series of tests on various string and character manipulation functions, random number generation, and logging utilities.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments.
    - `argv`: The array of command-line arguments.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Initializes the application with `fd_boot` using command-line arguments.
    - Creates a random number generator `rng` using `fd_rng_new` and `fd_rng_join`.
    - Performs tests on `fd_cstr_printf` and `fd_cstr_printf_check` with different inputs to validate their behavior.
    - Runs a loop for 10,000,000 iterations, logging progress every 1,000,000 iterations, and tests various `fd_cstr_to_*` functions with random values.
    - Tests `fd_cstr_to_ulong_seq` with different string inputs to validate sequence parsing.
    - Tests `fd_cstr_append_*` functions for different data types and formats, comparing results with reference strings.
    - Tests `fd_cstr_tokenize` with various string inputs and delimiters to validate tokenization.
    - Iterates over all possible `char` values to test character classification functions like `fd_isalnum`, `fd_isalpha`, etc.
    - Tests UTF-8 encoding functions with various Unicode code points.
    - Deletes the random number generator `rng` and logs a success message before halting the application.
- **Output**: Returns 0 to indicate successful execution.
