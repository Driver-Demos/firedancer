Thread-local variables for managing scratch memory allocation and state.

# Purpose
This code is a C header file that declares several thread-local variables used for managing scratch space in a multi-threaded environment. The variables `fd_scratch_in_prepare`, `fd_scratch_private_start`, `fd_scratch_private_free`, and `fd_scratch_private_stop` are initialized to zero or zero-like values at the start of a thread, indicating their role in tracking the allocation and deallocation of memory. The `fd_scratch_private_frame` pointer and its associated counters, `fd_scratch_private_frame_cnt` and `fd_scratch_private_frame_max`, are used to manage frames within the scratch space, with initial values set to `NULL` and zero, respectively. Additionally, if the macro `FD_HAS_ALLOCA` is defined, the variable `fd_alloca_check_private_sz` is declared, which suggests a conditional allocation size check for stack-based memory allocation.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `fd_scratch.h`


# Global Variables

---
### fd\_scratch\_in\_prepare
- **Type**: `int`
- **Description**: The `fd_scratch_in_prepare` variable is an integer that is initialized to 0 when a thread starts.
- **Use**: Indicates the preparation state of a thread in the scratch memory context.


---
### fd\_scratch\_private\_start
- **Type**: ``ulong``
- **Description**: `fd_scratch_private_start` is a global variable of type `ulong` that is initialized to 0UL at the start of a thread. It is part of a set of variables used for managing scratch space in a multi-threaded environment.
- **Use**: Tracks the starting point of a private scratch space for a thread.


---
### fd\_scratch\_private\_free
- **Type**: ``ulong``
- **Description**: `fd_scratch_private_free` is a global variable of type `ulong` that is initialized to 0UL at the start of a thread. It is part of a set of variables used for managing scratch space in a multi-threaded environment.
- **Use**: Tracks the amount of free scratch space available for a thread.


---
### fd\_scratch\_private\_stop
- **Type**: ``ulong``
- **Description**: A global variable of type `ulong` that is initialized to `0UL` when a thread starts.
- **Use**: Used to track the stop position of a private scratch space in a thread-local context.


---
### fd\_scratch\_private\_frame
- **Type**: `ulong *`
- **Description**: A pointer to an unsigned long integer that is initialized to NULL when a thread starts.
- **Use**: Used to manage or track a private frame in a thread-local context.


---
### fd\_scratch\_private\_frame\_cnt
- **Type**: ``ulong``
- **Description**: `fd_scratch_private_frame_cnt` is a global variable of type `ulong` that is initialized to 0UL at the start of a thread. It is part of a set of variables used for managing scratch space in a multi-threaded environment.
- **Use**: Tracks the current count of private frames in the scratch space for a thread.


---
### fd\_scratch\_private\_frame\_max
- **Type**: ``ulong``
- **Description**: Stores the maximum number of frames that can be used in a private context for a thread. It is initialized to `0UL` when a thread starts.
- **Use**: Used to track the maximum frame count in a thread's private context.


---
### fd\_alloca\_check\_private\_sz
- **Type**: ``ulong``
- **Description**: `fd_alloca_check_private_sz` is a global variable of type `ulong` that is conditionally defined when `FD_HAS_ALLOCA` is true. It is used to store a size value related to alloca operations.
- **Use**: Used to store the size for checking private allocations when `FD_HAS_ALLOCA` is defined.
