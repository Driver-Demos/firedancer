Makefile for adding headers, objects, and unit tests for `fd_scratch` in the `firedancer` codebase.

# Purpose
The `Makefile` content defines build and test instructions for a software project. It adds the header file `fd_scratch.h` and object files `fd_scratch` and `fd_util` to the build process. It also specifies a unit test named `test_scratch`, which depends on `fd_util`, and includes a command to run this unit test.
