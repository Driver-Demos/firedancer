Macros and inline functions for high-performance parallelized map-reduce operations using thread pools.

# Purpose
The code provides a framework for parallel processing using a map-reduce pattern, specifically designed to work with thread pools (`fd_tpool_t`). It defines macros and inline functions to facilitate the creation and execution of parallel tasks that can be distributed across multiple threads. The `FD_MAP_REDUCE` macros allow users to define operations that can be parallelized, with the ability to specify how data should be partitioned and reduced across threads. The code includes detailed instructions and safety tips for implementing these operations, ensuring that the parallel execution is efficient and safe.

The code also includes a special case, `FD_FOR_ALL`, which is a simplified version of `FD_MAP_REDUCE` for operations that do not require a reduction step. This is useful for tasks that only need to apply a function to each element in a data set without aggregating results. The code is intended to be included indirectly through a header file (`fd_tpool.h`), and it provides a set of private inline functions (`fd_map_reduce_private_*`) to handle different numbers of arguments for the map-reduce tasks. These functions and macros are designed to optimize thread dispatch and data locality, making them suitable for high-performance computing scenarios.
