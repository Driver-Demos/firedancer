Implements command-line argument and environment variable parsing for different data types.

# Purpose
The code defines a set of macros and functions for processing command-line arguments and environment variables in a POSIX environment. It uses conditional compilation to ensure that the code is only included when the `FD_ENV_STYLE` is set to 0, which indicates a POSIX environment. The primary functionality is to strip specific command-line arguments and optionally update their values based on environment variables. This is achieved through the macro `FD_ENV_STRIP_CMDLINE_IMPL`, which generates functions for different data types such as `char`, `int`, `float`, and others. These functions take pointers to argument count and argument vector, a key to search for, an environment variable key, and a default value. They update the argument list by removing the specified key and potentially updating the value based on the environment variable.

Additionally, the code provides a function [`fd_env_strip_cmdline_contains`](<#fd_env_strip_cmdline_contains>) that checks for the presence of a specific key in the command-line arguments and removes it if found. This function returns a boolean indicating whether the key was present. The code is designed to be part of a larger system where command-line and environment variable management is necessary, and it provides a consistent interface for handling these inputs across different data types. The use of macros allows for the generation of similar functions for various data types, reducing code duplication and maintaining consistency.
# Imports and Dependencies

- `stdlib.h`


# Functions

### fd\_env\_strip\_cmdline\_contains<!-- {{#callable:fd_env_strip_cmdline_contains}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/util/env/fd_env.c#L58>)

Removes occurrences of a specified key from the command line arguments and returns whether the key was found.
- **Inputs**:
    - `pargc`: A pointer to an integer representing the number of command line arguments.
    - `pargv`: A pointer to an array of strings representing the command line arguments.
    - `key`: A constant string representing the key to search for in the command line arguments.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Initialize `new_argc` to 0 and `found` to 0.
    - Check if `key`, `pargc`, and `pargv` are not NULL.
    - Iterate over each argument in `*pargv` using a for loop.
    - Compare each argument with `key` using `strcmp`.
    - If the argument does not match `key`, copy it to the new position in `*pargv` and increment `new_argc`.
    - If the argument matches `key`, set `found` to 1.
    - After the loop, update `*pargc` to `new_argc` and set `(*pargv)[new_argc]` to NULL to terminate the array.
    - Return `found` to indicate if the key was found.
- **Output**: Returns an integer indicating whether the key was found (1 if found, 0 if not).
