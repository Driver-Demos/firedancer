Tests for environment variable command-line stripping functions in various data types.

# Purpose
The code is a C program designed to test the functionality of command-line argument processing functions. It includes the `fd_env_strip_cmdline_*` functions, which are used to strip specific command-line arguments of various data types, such as `char`, `int`, `float`, and others, from an argument list. The program initializes a set of command-line arguments and then uses these functions to verify that they correctly identify and remove specified arguments while returning the expected values. The tests cover normal stripping, default value handling, and edge cases, ensuring that the functions behave as expected in different scenarios.

The program begins by setting up a simulated command-line argument list and then performs a series of tests using the `FD_TEST` macro to validate the behavior of the `fd_env_strip_cmdline_*` functions. It checks that the functions correctly strip arguments and return the expected values, including handling default values when arguments are not present. The program also tests the `fd_env_strip_cmdline_contains` function to verify the presence of specific arguments. The code concludes by logging a success message and halting execution. This program is intended to be executed as a standalone test suite for the command-line argument processing functions.

[View Source →](<../../../../../src/util/env/test_env.c#L5>)

Initializes the environment, processes command-line arguments, tests argument stripping functions, and logs the results before halting.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments.
    - `argv`: An array of strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Calls `fd_boot` to initialize the environment with `argc` and `argv`.
    - Defines a buffer `buf` and an array `_my_argv` to store command-line arguments.
    - Populates `my_argv` with predefined command-line arguments using a macro `_` to copy strings into `buf`.
    - Sets `my_argv[my_argc]` to `NULL` to mark the end of arguments.
    - Tests the `fd_env_strip_cmdline_*` functions to strip specific command-line arguments and verify the results using `FD_TEST`.
    - Performs tests for normal stripping, default pass-through, and edge cases of command-line arguments.
    - Tests the presence of specific command-line arguments using `fd_env_strip_cmdline_contains`.
    - Logs a notice message indicating the tests passed and calls `fd_halt` to terminate the program.
- **Output**: Returns 0 to indicate successful execution.
