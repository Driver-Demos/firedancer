APIs for extracting and converting environment and command line arguments to various data types.

# Purpose
This C header file defines a set of macros and function prototypes for extracting and converting command line arguments and environment variables into various data types. The primary functionality is provided by the `fd_env_strip_cmdline_*` functions, which search for key-value pairs in both the environment and command line arguments, convert the values to specified types, and return the last found value or a default if none is found. The functions also remove these key-value pairs from the command line arguments to support modular command line parsing. The header includes support for multiple data types, such as `char`, `int`, `ulong`, and `float`, and conditionally includes support for `double` if the target environment supports it. Additionally, the [`fd_env_strip_cmdline_contains`](<#fd_env_strip_cmdline_contains>) function checks for the presence of a specific key in the command line arguments and removes it if found.

[View Source →](<../../../../../src/util/env/fd_env.h#L63>)

Removes a specified key from command line arguments if present.
- **Description**: Use this function to check for the presence of a specific key in the command line arguments and remove it if found. This is useful for modular command line parsing, allowing different parts of a program to handle specific arguments independently. The function must be called with valid pointers for `pargc`, `pargv`, and `key`. If any of these pointers are null, the function will not perform any operation and will return 0. The command line arguments are expected to be null-terminated, and the function will update `pargc` and `pargv` to reflect the removal of the key.
- **Inputs**:
    - `pargc`: A pointer to an integer representing the number of command line arguments. Must not be null. The function updates this value to reflect the new count after removing the key.
    - `pargv`: A pointer to an array of strings representing the command line arguments. Must not be null. The function updates this array to remove the specified key.
    - `key`: A constant string representing the key to search for in the command line arguments. Must not be null. If the key is found, it is removed from the arguments.
- **Output**: Returns 1 if the key is found and removed, otherwise returns 0.
