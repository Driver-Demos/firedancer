Makefile for managing shared memory components, scripts, binaries, and tests in the Firedancer project.

# Purpose
The Makefile content defines build instructions for a software project. It uses a series of `$(call ...)` functions to add headers, objects, scripts, binaries, and unit tests to the build process. The `add-hdrs` function includes the header file `fd_shmem.h`. The `add-objs` function adds object files such as `fd_shmem_admin`, `fd_shmem_user`, and `fd_util`, with conditional logic to include either `fd_numa_linux` or `fd_numa_stub` based on the `FD_HAS_HOSTED` variable. The `add-scripts` function includes the script `fd_shmem_cfg`. The `make-bin` function creates the binary `fd_shmem_ctl` using `fd_util`, and the `make-unit-test` function sets up the unit test `test_shmem`. Finally, `add-test-scripts` includes the test script `test_shmem_ctl`.
