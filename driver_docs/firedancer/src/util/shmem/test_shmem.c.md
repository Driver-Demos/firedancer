Tests for shared memory operations, including name validation, page size conversion, and join/leave functionality.

# Purpose
The code is a C program designed to perform unit tests on shared memory operations. It includes various static assertions to validate constants related to shared memory, such as page sizes and maximum limits for NUMA nodes and CPUs. The program uses a random number generator to test the validity of shared memory names and their lengths, ensuring they conform to specified constraints. It also tests the conversion between string representations and numeric values for different page sizes.

The main functionality of the program involves testing the joining and leaving of shared memory segments. It verifies the correct behavior of functions that query shared memory by name, join, and address. The program simulates multiple join and leave operations, checking reference counts and ensuring that shared memory is correctly mapped and unmapped. It also includes tests for acquiring and releasing shared memory pages, validating their alignment and NUMA node assignments. The program is structured to run these tests only if the `FD_HAS_HOSTED` capability is available, otherwise, it logs a warning and exits.

Initializes the environment and logs a warning if the `FD_HAS_HOSTED` capability is not available, then halts execution.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The count of command-line arguments.
    - `argv`: The array of command-line arguments.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Calls `fd_boot` to initialize the environment with `argc` and `argv`.
    - Logs a warning message indicating that the unit test requires `FD_HAS_HOSTED` capabilities.
    - Calls `fd_halt` to stop further execution.
- **Output**: Returns 0, indicating successful execution.
