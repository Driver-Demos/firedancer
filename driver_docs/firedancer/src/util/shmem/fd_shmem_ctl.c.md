A command-line utility for shared memory control, supporting operations like create, unlink, and query.

# Purpose
The code is an executable C program designed to manage shared memory operations. It provides a command-line interface for various shared memory management tasks, such as querying system information and creating or unlinking shared memory segments. The program includes commands like `help`, `cpu-cnt`, `numa-cnt`, `cpu-idx`, `numa-idx`, `create`, `unlink`, and `query`, each performing specific operations related to shared memory. For example, the `create` command allows the creation of shared memory segments with specified parameters, while the `unlink` command removes shared memory segments. The program uses functions like `fd_shmem_create_multi` and `fd_shmem_unlink` to perform these operations.

The program begins by initializing the environment with `fd_boot` and processes command-line arguments to execute the appropriate shared memory operations. It uses a series of conditional checks to determine which command to execute and logs the success or failure of each operation. The program also includes error handling to manage incorrect or insufficient arguments. The use of `FD_IMPORT_CSTR` and other macros indicates that the program relies on external definitions and utilities, likely provided by the `fd_util.h` header and related files. The code is structured to run on hosted platforms, with a fallback for unsupported platforms that logs an error message.

Initializes the environment, checks the number of command-line arguments, logs a notice, and halts the program.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The count of command-line arguments passed to the program.
    - `argv`: An array of strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Calls `fd_boot` to initialize the environment with `argc` and `argv`.
    - Checks if `argc` is less than 1 and logs an error if true.
    - Checks if `argc` is greater than 1 and logs an error if true, indicating unsupported platform.
    - Logs a notice indicating that 0 commands were processed.
    - Calls `fd_halt` to terminate the program.
- **Output**: Returns 0 to indicate successful execution.
