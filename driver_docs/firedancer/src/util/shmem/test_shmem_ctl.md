A Bash script to test various functionalities of the `fd_shmem_ctl` shared memory control utility.

# Purpose
This script is a Bash test suite for the `fd_shmem_ctl` command-line utility, which manages shared memory operations. It is designed to verify the correct behavior of various `fd_shmem_ctl` commands, such as `create`, `query`, `unlink`, and others. The script sets up the environment by determining the location of the binaries and configuring test parameters like shared memory name, page count, page size, CPU index, and mode. It then executes a series of tests, checking for expected and unexpected outcomes, and reports failures using the `fail` function. The script also attempts to clean up any leftover shared memory from previous runs to ensure a clean test environment.
# Global Variables

---
### UNIT\_TEST
- **Type**: ``string``
- **Description**: `UNIT_TEST` is a string variable that stores the directory path of the script's source file. It uses the `dirname` command to extract the directory name from the `$BASH_SOURCE` variable, which contains the path of the script being executed.
- **Use**: Stores the directory path of the script's source file for use in determining the location of binaries.


---
### BUILD
- **Type**: ``string``
- **Description**: Represents the directory path where the build binaries are located. It is derived from the directory path of the unit test binaries.
- **Use**: Used to construct the path to the `bin` directory where the executable files are stored.


---
### BIN
- **Type**: ``string``
- **Description**: The `BIN` variable is a string that represents the path to the 'bin' directory within the build directory. It is constructed by appending '/bin' to the `BUILD` variable, which itself is derived from the directory of the unit test script.
- **Use**: Used to specify the directory path where the binary files are located for executing various commands in the script.


---
### SHMEM
- **Type**: ``string``
- **Description**: The variable `SHMEM` is a string that holds the name of the shared memory segment used in the script. It is set to the value `test_fd_shmem_ctl`. This name is used in various commands to create, query, and unlink shared memory segments.
- **Use**: Used as the identifier for shared memory operations in the script.


---
### PAGE\_CNT
- **Type**: `integer`
- **Description**: Specifies the number of pages to use in shared memory operations. It is set to the integer value 3.
- **Use**: Used as an argument in the `fd_shmem_ctl create` command to define the number of pages for shared memory creation.


---
### PAGE\_SZ
- **Type**: ``string``
- **Description**: `PAGE_SZ` is a global variable that specifies the size of a memory page. It is set to the value `normal`, which indicates a standard page size.
- **Use**: Used as an argument in commands to specify the page size for shared memory operations.


---
### CPU\_IDX
- **Type**: `integer`
- **Description**: The variable `CPU_IDX` is an integer that specifies the index of the CPU to use for certain operations in the script. It is set to 0, indicating the first CPU.
- **Use**: Used as a parameter in the `fd_shmem_ctl create` command to specify the CPU index.


---
### MODE
- **Type**: ``int``
- **Description**: The `MODE` variable is a global variable that stores the file permission mode for shared memory operations. It is set to the octal value `0600`, which means read and write permissions for the owner only.
- **Use**: Used to specify the permission mode when creating shared memory segments in the script.


---
### FD\_LOG\_PATH
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: A global variable that stores the path to the log file for the application. It is set to an empty string to disable logging.
- **Use**: Used to specify the log file path for the application, but currently disables logging by being set to an empty string.


# Functions

---
### fail
Prints a failure message and exits the script with a status code of 1.
- **Inputs**:
    - `$1`: The description of the operation that failed.
    - `$2`: The unexpected exit code of the operation.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Prints a failure message with the format 'FAIL: <operation> unexpected exit code <code>' using the provided arguments.
    - Prints 'Log N/A' to indicate that no log is available.
    - Exits the script with a status code of 1 to indicate failure.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it exits the script with a status code of 1.
