Command-line tool for managing shared memory regions, querying CPU and NUMA node information.

# Purpose
The `fd_shmem_ctl` command-line tool provides several commands to manage shared memory regions and query system information related to CPUs and NUMA nodes. The `help` command displays a list of available commands and their descriptions. The `cpu-cnt` and `numa-cnt` commands print the number of CPUs and NUMA nodes, respectively. The `cpu-idx` and `numa-idx` commands allow users to find the closest CPU to a given NUMA node or the closest NUMA node to a given CPU, printing the index or a dash if the input is invalid. The `create` command creates a shared memory region with specified parameters, distributing pages across CPUs as specified, and setting permissions. The `unlink` command removes a shared memory region, with an option to detect the page size if not specified. The `query` command provides information about a shared memory region, including error codes and page details, with an option to detect the page size if not specified.
