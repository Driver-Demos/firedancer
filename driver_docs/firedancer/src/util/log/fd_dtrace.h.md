Wrappers for software-defined trace points with conditional support for SystemTap SDT on Linux.

# Purpose
The `fd_dtrace.h` file is a C header file that provides macros for software-defined trace points, which are used for debugging and performance analysis. It checks for the availability of the `<sys/sdt.h>` header and whether the code is being compiled on a Linux system to determine if SystemTap's static tracepoints are supported (`FD_HAS_SDT`). If supported, it includes `<sys/sdt.h>` and defines macros like `FD_DTRACE_PROBE` and `FD_DTRACE_PROBE_1` to `FD_DTRACE_PROBE_5`, which map to SystemTap's `DTRACE_PROBE` macros, allowing for up to five arguments. If SystemTap is not available, the macros are defined as no-operations, ensuring that the code can compile without errors while ignoring the trace points. The file also includes a workaround for a known incompatibility between Clang version 19 and SystemTap SDT.
