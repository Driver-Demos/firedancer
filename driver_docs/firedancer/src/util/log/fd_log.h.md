Header file for logging utilities, defining log levels, macros, and functions for managing log streams and metadata.

# Purpose
The code is a C header file that defines a logging system for applications. It provides functionality to produce two types of log message streams: an ephemeral log message stream (typically directed to `stderr`) and a permanent log message stream (a log file). The logging system prioritizes writes to the log file over `stderr` and ensures that log messages are written quasi-atomically to prevent interleaving of messages from different threads. The logging system supports various log levels, such as `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `NOTICE`, `WARNING`, `ERR`, `CRIT`, `ALERT`, and `EMERG`, which mirror the Linux syslog levels. Each log level has corresponding macros for logging messages and hexdumps, allowing detailed and formatted logging of events and memory regions.

The header file also defines several functions and macros for managing application and thread identifiers, host and CPU information, and thread group details. These identifiers help in uniquely identifying applications, threads, hosts, and CPUs within an enterprise. The file includes functions for configuring the logging system, such as setting log levels, enabling signal handlers, and managing time sources for log timestamps. Additionally, it provides internal functions for handling log message formatting and output, which are not intended for direct use by application developers. The header file is designed to be included in other C source files to provide logging capabilities across an application.

- **Description**: This function sets the log's time source to a user-defined clock function, which should return the current time in nanoseconds since the UNIX epoch in GMT. It is important to call this function when there are no concurrent log operations to avoid potential race conditions. The `clock` parameter must point to a valid function that matches the expected signature, and `args` can be used to pass additional data to the clock function. If the provided `clock` is invalid or if it is called while log operations are ongoing, the behavior is undefined.
- **Inputs**:
    - `clock`: A function pointer of type `fd_clock_func_t` that returns the current time in nanoseconds since the UNIX epoch in GMT. Must not be null.
    - `args`: A pointer to any additional arguments needed by the clock function. This can be null if no additional arguments are required.

It is intended to be used when a formatted representation of the current time is needed, such as for logging purposes. The function requires that the provided buffer is large enough to hold the formatted string, which must be at least `FD_LOG_WALLCLOCK_CSTR_BUF_SZ` bytes. If the timestamp is not valid or cannot be converted, the function will return a string indicating the timestamp in seconds since the UNIX epoch.
- **Inputs**:
    - `now`: A long integer representing the timestamp in nanoseconds since the UNIX epoch. This value should be a valid timestamp; otherwise, the function may return a fallback string format.
    - `buf`: A pointer to a character buffer where the formatted string will be stored. This buffer must not be null and must have a size of at least `FD_LOG_WALLCLOCK_CSTR_BUF_SZ` bytes.

[View Source →](<../../../../../src/util/log/fd_log.h#L580>)

Puts the calling thread to sleep for a specified duration.
- **Description**: This function is used to pause the execution of the calling thread for a duration specified in nanoseconds. If the duration is less than or equal to zero, the function will yield the processor instead of sleeping. It is important to note that the function should be called when the thread needs to wait for a certain period, and it may return early if the sleep is interrupted. The remaining sleep time will be returned in such cases.
- **Inputs**:
    - `dt`: Specifies the duration to sleep in nanoseconds. It must be greater than zero to sleep; otherwise, it will yield the processor. If the value is negative or zero, the function will not sleep and will return 0.

[View Source →](<../../../../../src/util/log/fd_log.h#L603>)

Waits until the specified time is reached.
- **Description**: This function is used to block the calling thread until the wall clock time reaches or exceeds the specified `then` value, which is provided in nanoseconds since the UNIX epoch. It is important to call this function only after the logging system has been initialized. The function employs various strategies to manage CPU usage during the wait, including sleeping, yielding, and spinning, depending on how much time remains until the specified time is reached. If the remaining time is less than approximately 1 microsecond, it will spin; for times between 1 microsecond and 100 milliseconds, it will yield; and for times greater than 1 second, it will sleep until about 100 milliseconds remain. The return value is the current wall clock time when the wait ends, which will be at least equal to `then`.
- **Inputs**:
    - `then`: The target time in nanoseconds since the UNIX epoch. This value must be greater than the current wall clock time when the function is called. If `then` is less than or equal to the current time, the function will return immediately with the current time.
- **Output**: Returns the current wall clock time in nanoseconds since the UNIX epoch when the wait ends, which will be at least equal to the `then` value.
- **See Also**: [`fd_log_wait_until`](<fd_log.c.md#fd_log_wait_until>)  (Implementation)

- **Description**: This function is used to set the name of the application that will be logged. It should be called after the logging system has been initialized. If the provided name is `NULL`, a default name of "[app]" will be used. If the application name is already set to the same value, no action is taken. The function is not thread-safe, so it should not be called concurrently from multiple threads.
- **Inputs**:
    - `app`: A pointer to a constant string representing the application name. It must not be null if you want to set a specific name. If it is null, the function will use a default name. The function does not retain ownership of the string after the call.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value and does not mutate any inputs.
- **See Also**: [`fd_log_private_app_set`](<fd_log.c.md#fd_log_private_app_set>)  (Implementation)

### fd\_log\_private\_host\_set<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_log_private_host_set}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/util/log/fd_log.h#L731>)

Sets the host description for logging.
- **Description**: This function updates the host description used in logging. It should be called after the logging system has been initialized. If the provided host string is NULL or empty, it defaults to a placeholder value of "[host]". The function does not retain ownership of the input string, and it is the caller's responsibility to ensure that the string remains valid for the duration of the call.
- **Inputs**:
    - `host`: A pointer to a constant string representing the host description. It must not be NULL or empty; otherwise, it defaults to "[host]". The caller retains ownership of the string and must ensure it remains valid during the function call.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value and does not mutate any inputs.
- **See Also**: [`fd_log_private_host_set`](<fd_log.c.md#fd_log_private_host_set>)  (Implementation)

### fd\_log\_private\_group\_set<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_log_private_group_set}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/util/log/fd_log.h#L732>)

Sets the description of the thread group.
- **Description**: This function updates the description of the thread group to the string pointed to by `group`. It must be called after the logging system has been initialized. If `group` is NULL or an empty string, the description will be reset to a default value. The function does not retain ownership of the `group` string after the call, and the actual description may be truncated to fit within a maximum length.
- **Inputs**:
    - `group`: A pointer to a constant string that describes the thread group. Must not be NULL or empty unless resetting to default. The function does not retain ownership of this pointer.
- **Output**: None
- **See Also**: [`fd_log_private_group_set`](<fd_log.c.md#fd_log_private_group_set>)  (Implementation)

### fd\_log\_private\_user\_set<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_log_private_user_set}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/util/log/fd_log.h#L733>)

Sets the user description for logging.
- **Description**: This function updates the user description used in logging. It should be called after the logging system has been initialized. If the provided user string is NULL or empty, it defaults to a placeholder value of "[user]". The function does not retain ownership of the input string, and it is the caller's responsibility to ensure that the string remains valid for the duration of the call.
- **Inputs**:
    - `user`: A pointer to a constant string representing the user description. It must not be NULL or empty unless the default placeholder is intended. The function does not retain ownership of this string.
- **Output**: None
- **See Also**: [`fd_log_private_user_set`](<fd_log.c.md#fd_log_private_user_set>)  (Implementation)

### fd\_log\_private\_logfile\_fd<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_log_private_logfile_fd}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/util/log/fd_log.h#L738>)

Returns the file descriptor for the log file.
- **Description**: This function provides the file descriptor associated with the log file used for logging messages. It should be called after the logging system has been initialized. The returned file descriptor can be used for low-level operations on the log file, such as direct writes. If the logging system is not properly initialized, the behavior is undefined.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Output**: Returns an integer representing the file descriptor for the log file. This value can be used for further file operations.
- **See Also**: [`fd_log_private_logfile_fd`](<fd_log.c.md#fd_log_private_logfile_fd>)  (Implementation)
