Makefile for adding headers, objects, and unit tests with conditional threading support.

# Purpose
This Makefile script manages the build process for a software project. It adds header files and object files using the `add-hdrs` and `add-objs` functions. The script conditionally includes thread-related object files if `FD_HAS_THREADS` is defined, otherwise, it includes non-threaded versions. It also defines and runs unit tests for `test_cpuset` and `test_tile` using the `make-unit-test` and `run-unit-test` functions, ensuring that the components are tested during the build process.
