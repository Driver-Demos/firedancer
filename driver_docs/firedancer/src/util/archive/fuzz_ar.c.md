Fuzz testing for archive reading functions using LLVM's libFuzzer.

# Purpose
This code is a fuzz testing module designed to work with the LLVM libFuzzer framework. It includes two main functions: [`LLVMFuzzerInitialize`](<#llvmfuzzerinitialize>) and [`LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`](<#llvmfuzzertestoneinput>). The [`LLVMFuzzerInitialize`](<#llvmfuzzerinitialize>) function sets up the environment for the fuzzer by configuring logging and initializing the application with `fd_boot`. It also registers `fd_halt` to be called upon program exit using `atexit`. The [`LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`](<#llvmfuzzertestoneinput>) function is the core of the fuzz testing process. It takes a pointer to input data and its size, then uses `fmemopen` to create a file stream from this data. The function reads and processes the data using functions from the `fd_ar` module, specifically `fd_ar_read_init` and `fd_ar_read_next`, which are likely used to parse or handle archive data. The function ensures that the file stream is properly closed before returning.

The code includes necessary headers and checks for the `FD_HAS_HOSTED` macro to ensure it is running in a suitable environment. It uses utility functions from the `fd_util` and `fd_fuzz` libraries, indicating that it relies on external components for logging, initialization, and error handling. The module is intended to be part of a larger testing framework, providing a specific interface for fuzz testing archive-related functionality.

# Functions

---
### LLVMFuzzerInitialize<!-- {{#callable:LLVMFuzzerInitialize}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/util/archive/fuzz_ar.c#L12>)

Initializes the fuzzer environment by setting environment variables, booting the system, registering an exit function, and setting the log level.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: A pointer to the argument count, typically from the command line.
    - `argv`: A pointer to the argument vector, typically from the command line.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Set the environment variable `FD_LOG_BACKTRACE` to `0` to disable backtrace logging.
    - Call `fd_boot` with `argc` and `argv` to initialize the system.
    - Register `fd_halt` to be called at program exit using `atexit`.
    - Set the log level for standard error output to `4` using `fd_log_level_stderr_set`.
    - Return `0` to indicate successful initialization.
- **Output**: Returns `0` to indicate successful initialization.

### LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput<!-- {{#callable:LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/util/archive/fuzz_ar.c#L23>)

Processes input data by reading it as a file and extracting metadata from it.
- **Inputs**:
    - `data`: A pointer to an array of unsigned characters representing the input data.
    - `size`: The size of the input data in bytes.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Opens a memory stream from the input data using `fmemopen` and assigns it to `file`.
    - Checks if the `file` is successfully opened using `FD_TEST`.
    - Initializes the file reading process with `fd_ar_read_init`.
    - Declares an array `meta` of type `fd_ar_meta_t` to store metadata.
    - Iterates 8 times, calling `fd_ar_read_next` to read the next metadata entry from the file into `meta`.
    - Closes the file using `fclose` and checks for successful closure with `FD_TEST`.
- **Output**: Returns 0 to indicate successful execution.
