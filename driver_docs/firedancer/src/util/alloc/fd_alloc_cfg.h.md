Configuration for memory allocation size classes, defining superblock and block footprints for efficient allocation.

# Purpose
The code defines a configuration for a memory allocation system that uses size classes to manage memory efficiently. It is a C header file that provides constants and a data structure to support the allocation of memory blocks in different size classes. The file defines a set of size classes, each with a specific superblock footprint, block footprint, and block count. These size classes are used to group memory allocations into superblocks, which helps reduce the overhead associated with frequent small allocations.

The configuration includes 126 size classes, each represented by the `fd_alloc_sizeclass_cfg_t` structure. This structure contains information about the superblock size, block size, number of blocks, and concurrency group mask for each size class. The code also defines thresholds and constants, such as `FD_ALLOC_FOOTPRINT_SMALL_THRESH`, which determines when an allocation is considered large and handled directly by the `fd_wksp_alloc` allocator. The size classes are designed to be logarithmically spaced to optimize memory usage and minimize fragmentation. The configuration allows for customization to match specific application needs by adjusting the size classes for tighter spatial packing.
# Global Variables

---
### fd\_alloc\_sizeclass\_cfg
- **Type**: ``fd_alloc_sizeclass_cfg_t const[126]``
- **Description**: Defines an array of 126 constant `fd_alloc_sizeclass_cfg_t` structures, each representing a size class configuration for memory allocation. Each entry in the array specifies the superblock footprint, block footprint, block count, and concurrency group mask for a particular size class.
- **Use**: Used to configure memory allocation size classes for efficient memory management.


# Data Structures

---
### fd\_alloc\_sizeclass\_cfg
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `superblock_footprint`: Size of the allocation needed to make a superblock for this class.
    - `block_footprint`: Footprint of blocks in this size class, ensuring block count times block footprint plus 16 is less than or equal to superblock footprint.
    - `block_cnt`: Number of blocks in this size class, ranging from 1 to 64.
    - `cgroup_mask`: Number of concurrency groups for this size class minus 1, which is a power of 2 minus 1, and at most `CGROUP_HINT_MAX`.
- **Description**: Defines the configuration for a size class in a memory allocation system, specifying the superblock size, block size, number of blocks, and concurrency group mask for efficient memory management and allocation.

### fd\_alloc\_sizeclass\_cfg\_t
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `superblock_footprint`: Size of the allocation needed to make a superblock for this class.
    - `block_footprint`: Footprint of blocks in this size class, where `block_cnt*block_footprint+16` must be less than or equal to `superblock_footprint`.
    - `block_cnt`: Number of blocks in this size class, ranging from 1 to 64.
    - `cgroup_mask`: Number of concurrency groups for this size class minus 1, which is a power of 2 minus 1, and at most `CGROUP_HINT_MAX`.
- **Description**: Defines the configuration for size classes used in memory allocation, specifying the superblock size, block footprint, number of blocks, and concurrency group mask for each size class. This configuration helps manage memory allocation efficiently by grouping smaller allocations into superblocks, reducing overhead and improving performance.
