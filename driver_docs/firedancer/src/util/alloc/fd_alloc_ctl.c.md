Command-line utility for memory allocation control, supporting operations like new, delete, malloc, free, and query.

# Purpose
The code is an executable C program that provides a command-line interface for managing memory allocation within a workspace. It includes functionality for creating, deleting, allocating, freeing, and querying memory allocations. The program uses a series of commands such as `help`, `tag`, `new`, `delete`, `malloc`, `free`, `compact`, and `query` to perform these operations. Each command is processed in sequence, and the program logs the success or failure of each operation. The code relies on several external functions and macros, such as `fd_wksp_attach`, `fd_alloc_new`, and `fd_alloc_malloc`, which are likely defined in the included headers `fd_util.h` and `fd_wksp_private.h`.

The program begins by initializing the environment with `fd_boot` and processes command-line arguments to execute the specified commands. It uses a series of conditional checks to determine which command to execute and performs the corresponding memory management operation. The program also includes error handling to log errors if commands are used incorrectly or if operations fail. The [`main`](<#main>) function is defined twice, with one version executing if the `FD_HAS_HOSTED` macro is defined, indicating that the program is running in a hosted environment. The other version provides a minimal implementation for non-hosted environments, logging an error if more than one argument is provided.
# Imports and Dependencies

- `../fd_util.h`
- `../wksp/fd_wksp_private.h`
- `stdio.h`


# Functions

---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/util/alloc/fd_alloc_ctl.c#L222>)

Initializes the environment, checks command-line arguments, logs a notice, and halts the program.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments.
    - `argv`: An array of strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Calls `fd_boot` to initialize the environment with `argc` and `argv`.
    - Checks if `argc` is less than 1 and logs an error if true.
    - Checks if `argc` is greater than 1 and logs an error if true, indicating unsupported platform.
    - Logs a notice indicating that 0 commands were processed.
    - Calls `fd_halt` to halt the program.
- **Output**: Returns 0, indicating successful execution.


# Function Declarations (Public API)

---
### fd\_alloc\_fprintf<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_alloc_fprintf}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/util/alloc/fd_alloc_ctl.c#L10>)

Prints allocation details to a specified stream.
- **Description**: Use this function to print detailed information about memory allocations associated with a given `fd_alloc_t` object to a specified output stream. This function is useful for debugging and monitoring memory usage. It requires a valid `fd_alloc_t` pointer and a non-null `FILE` stream. If the `stream` is null, the function returns immediately with a value of 0, indicating no output was produced. The function returns the number of characters printed to the stream.
- **Inputs**:
    - `join`: A pointer to an `fd_alloc_t` object representing the memory allocation context. Must not be null.
    - `stream`: A pointer to a `FILE` object where the allocation details will be printed. Must not be null. If null, the function returns 0 immediately.
- **Output**: Returns the number of characters printed to the stream. If the stream is null, returns 0.
- **See Also**: [`fd_alloc_fprintf`](<fd_alloc.c.md#fd_alloc_fprintf>)  (Implementation)
