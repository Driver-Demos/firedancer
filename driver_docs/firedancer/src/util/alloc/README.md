Memory allocator implementation, configuration, control utilities, tests, and build scripts.


## Files
- **[fd_alloc.c](fd_alloc.c.md)**: Memory allocation utilities for managing superblocks and sizeclasses, including functions for allocation, deallocation, and diagnostics.
- **[fd_alloc.h](fd_alloc.h.md)**: A high-performance, lock-free memory allocator optimized for concurrency and small allocation sizes.
- **[fd_alloc_cfg.h](fd_alloc_cfg.h.md)**: Configuration for memory allocation size classes, defining superblock and block footprints for efficient allocation.
- **[fd_alloc_ctl.c](fd_alloc_ctl.c.md)**: Command-line utility for memory allocation control, supporting operations like new, delete, malloc, free, and query.
- **[fd_alloc_ctl_help](fd_alloc_ctl_help.md)**: Command-line interface for managing workspace allocations, including creation, deletion, and querying.
- **[Local.mk](Local.mk.md)**: Makefile for building and testing the fd_alloc component in the firedancer codebase.
- **[test_alloc.c](test_alloc.c.md)**: Tests memory allocation and deallocation functions, including torture tests for single and multi-threaded scenarios.
- **[test_alloc_ctl](test_alloc_ctl.md)**: A Bash script for testing the `fd_alloc_ctl` command-line tool in the `firedancer` codebase.
