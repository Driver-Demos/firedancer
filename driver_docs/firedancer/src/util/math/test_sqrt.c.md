Tests the square root functions for various integer types using random number generation.

# Purpose
This code is an executable C program designed to test the correctness of square root functions for various integer types. It includes the necessary headers `fd_util.h` and `fd_sqrt.h` to access utility functions and square root operations. The program initializes a random number generator and performs 50 million iterations of tests on square root functions for different data types, including `uchar`, `ushort`, `uint`, and `ulong`, as well as their signed counterparts. 

The main testing logic is encapsulated in a macro `TEST`, which verifies the accuracy of the square root calculations by comparing the results of the square root functions against expected values. The program logs progress every million iterations and reports errors if any discrepancies are found during the tests. Upon successful completion of all tests, it logs a "pass" message. The program also manages the lifecycle of the random number generator, ensuring proper initialization and cleanup.

[View Source →](<../../../../../src/util/math/test_sqrt.c#L4>)

Initializes the environment, performs a series of random number-based tests on square root functions, and logs the results.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments.
    - `argv`: An array of command-line argument strings.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Calls `fd_boot` to initialize the environment with command-line arguments.
    - Creates a random number generator `rng` using `fd_rng_new` and `fd_rng_join`.
    - Initializes a counter `ctr` to zero.
    - Iterates 50,000,000 times, logging progress every 1,000,000 iterations.
    - Defines a macro `TEST` to perform a series of tests on square root functions for different data types (`uchar`, `ushort`, `uint`, `ulong`).
    - In each iteration, generates a random number `n` and shifts a random value `x` by `n` bits.
    - Calculates the square root `y` of `x` and checks if the result is valid; logs an error if not.
    - Converts `x` to a signed integer `u` and performs similar square root calculations and validations for signed integers.
    - Performs additional tests using `fd_##INT##_re_sqrt` and `fd_##INT##_sqrt_abs` functions, logging errors if results are invalid.
    - Deletes the random number generator using `fd_rng_delete` and `fd_rng_leave`.
    - Logs a final notice indicating the tests passed and calls `fd_halt` to terminate the program.
- **Output**: Returns 0 to indicate successful execution.
