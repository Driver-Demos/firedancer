Tests statistical functions and random number generation for various data types.

# Purpose
The code is a C program designed to test statistical functions and random number generation utilities. It includes headers for utility functions and statistical operations, such as `fd_util.h` and `fd_stat.h`. The program defines functions to generate random floating-point numbers uniformly distributed in the range [-0.5, +0.5]. It also includes conditional compilation for double precision support, indicated by the `FD_HAS_DOUBLE` macro.

The [`main`](<#main>) function initializes a random number generator and performs a series of tests on statistical functions. These tests include averaging two integers, filtering arrays based on a threshold, and fitting data to normal and exponential distributions. The tests are conducted for various data types, including signed and unsigned integers, floats, and conditionally, doubles and 128-bit integers. The program uses macros to define repetitive test patterns and checks the correctness of statistical computations using assertions. The program concludes by cleaning up the random number generator and logging a success message before terminating.

# Functions

---
### fd\_rng\_float<!-- {{#callable:fd_rng_float}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/util/math/test_stat.c#L6>)

Generates a random floating-point number uniformly distributed in the range [-0.5, +0.5].
- **Inputs**:
    - `rng`: A pointer to an `fd_rng_t` structure, which represents the random number generator state.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Calls the function `fd_rng_float_c` with the `rng` argument to generate a random float.
    - Subtracts 0.5 from the result of `fd_rng_float_c` to shift the range from [0, 1) to [-0.5, +0.5).
- **Output**: A `float` representing a random number uniformly distributed in the range [-0.5, +0.5].

### fd\_rng\_double<!-- {{#callable:fd_rng_double}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/util/math/test_stat.c#L8>)

Generates a double-precision floating-point random number uniformly distributed in the range [-0.5, +0.5].
- **Inputs**:
    - `rng`: A pointer to an `fd_rng_t` structure, which represents the random number generator state.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Calls the function `fd_rng_double_c` with the `rng` argument to generate a random double-precision floating-point number.
    - Subtracts 0.5 from the result of `fd_rng_double_c` to shift the range from [0, 1) to [-0.5, +0.5).
    - Returns the adjusted random number.
- **Output**: A double-precision floating-point number in the range [-0.5, +0.5].


---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/util/math/test_stat.c#L13>)

Initializes the environment, performs statistical tests on various data types, and logs the results before terminating.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments.
    - `argv`: An array of command-line argument strings.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Calls `fd_boot` to initialize the environment with command-line arguments.
    - Creates a random number generator `rng` using `fd_rng_new` and `fd_rng_join`.
    - Defines and executes `AVG2_INT_TEST` macro to test average calculations for various integer types.
    - Defines and executes `FILT_TEST` macro to test filtering operations for various data types, iterating 1,000,000 times for each type.
    - Performs robust normal and exponential fitting tests on arrays of floats and doubles, iterating 1,000 times for each.
    - Logs a notice message indicating the tests passed.
    - Deletes the random number generator using `fd_rng_delete` and `fd_rng_leave`.
    - Calls `fd_halt` to terminate the program.
- **Output**: Returns 0 to indicate successful execution.
