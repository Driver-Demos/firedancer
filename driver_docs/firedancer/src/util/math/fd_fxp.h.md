Primitives for portable fixed-point arithmetic with rounding and overflow detection, targeting 64-bit unsigned integers.

# Purpose
The code is a C header file that provides a collection of functions for performing fixed-point arithmetic operations. It is designed to handle arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, square root, logarithm, and exponential functions using fixed-point representation with 30 fractional bits. The code is optimized for platforms that support 64-bit unsigned integer arithmetic and includes implementations for both 64-bit and 128-bit integer operations, depending on the platform's capabilities.

The header file defines a private API for internal use and a set of inline functions for fixed-point arithmetic operations. These functions include various rounding modes for multiplication and division, such as round toward zero, round away from zero, and round to nearest with ties handled in different ways. The file also includes functions for computing the square root, logarithm base 2, and exponential functions in fixed-point format. The code is structured to provide both precise and fast variants of these operations, with the fast variants assuming certain conditions for performance optimization. The header file is intended to be included in other C source files to provide fixed-point arithmetic capabilities.
