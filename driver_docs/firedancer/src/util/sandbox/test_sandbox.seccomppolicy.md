Defines a seccomp policy for system calls with specific argument conditions.

# Purpose
The configuration specifies conditions for certain operations based on the value of `arg 0`. The `write` operation is allowed if `arg 0` equals 2 or 3. The `fsync` operation is allowed only if `arg 0` equals 3. The `exit_group` operation is listed without conditions, indicating it may be executed without specific argument checks.
