Makefile for building and testing the `fd_clock` component if `FD_HAS_DOUBLE` is defined.

# Purpose
This Makefile snippet conditionally includes headers and object files, and defines a unit test for the `fd_clock` component if the `FD_HAS_DOUBLE` flag is set. It adds the header `fd_clock.h` and object files `fd_clock` and `fd_util` to the build process. It also sets up and runs a unit test named `test_clock` that depends on `fd_util`.
