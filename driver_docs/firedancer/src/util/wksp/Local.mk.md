Makefile for building and testing workspace components and utilities in the Firedancer project.

# Purpose
The provided content is a Makefile script used to manage the build process of a software project. It defines several operations using the `call` function to add header files and object files, create binaries, and manage unit tests. The script includes conditional logic with `ifdef FD_HAS_HOSTED` to determine if certain unit tests should be compiled and executed, based on the availability of the `fd_shmem` API support. The script specifies the creation of a binary named `fd_wksp_ctl` and includes unit tests for various components such as `test_wksp_used_treap`, `test_wksp_free_treap`, and others. Additionally, it includes a commented-out line indicating a potential issue with the `test_wksp_helper` unit test, marked with `FIXME`.
