Unit tests for checkpoint and restore functions with various frame styles and error handling.

# Purpose
The code is a C program designed to test the functionality of checkpointing and restoring data using memory-mapped I/O (MMIO). It includes a series of tests to validate the behavior of functions related to checkpointing (`fd_checkpt_*`) and restoring (`fd_restore_*`) data. The program uses static assertions to ensure that certain constants are defined correctly, such as error codes and frame styles. It initializes buffers and structures for checkpointing and restoring, and it performs various operations to test the correctness of these processes, including opening, closing, and handling data frames in both raw and LZ4 compressed styles.

The program is structured to handle command-line arguments for data and MMIO sizes, and it logs the progress of tests using a logging mechanism. It checks for the presence of LZ4 support and adjusts the tests accordingly. The main function initializes a random number generator to create test data and iterates through multiple test scenarios, including end-to-end tests, buffer size variations, and frame style variations. The program ensures that the checkpoint and restore operations handle different data sizes and conditions, such as zero-sized buffers and unsupported frame styles, and it verifies that the data integrity is maintained throughout the process.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `../fd_util.h`


# Global Variables

---
### in
- **Type**: ``uchar` array`
- **Description**: An array of unsigned characters with a size defined by `BUF_MAX`. It is used to store input data for processing.
- **Use**: Stores input data for various operations in the program.


---
### out
- **Type**: ``uchar[]``
- **Description**: An array of unsigned characters with a size defined by `BUF_MAX`. It is used to store output data during the execution of the program.
- **Use**: Stores output data for operations involving checkpoint and restore processes.


---
### mmio
- **Type**: ``uchar[]``
- **Description**: An array of unsigned characters with a size defined by `BUF_MAX`. It is used to store data for memory-mapped I/O operations.
- **Use**: Used as a buffer for memory-mapped I/O operations in the checkpoint and restore processes.


---
### \_checkpt
- **Type**: ``fd_checkpt_t` array`
- **Description**: The `_checkpt` variable is a static array of type `fd_checkpt_t` with a size of 1. It is used to manage checkpoint operations in memory-mapped I/O (MMIO) contexts.
- **Use**: Used to initialize and manage checkpoint operations in the program.


---
### \_restore
- **Type**: ``fd_restore_t` array`
- **Description**: An array of type `fd_restore_t` with a single element, used to store state information for restoration operations. The `fd_restore_t` type is likely a structure that holds data necessary for restoring a checkpoint or similar operation.
- **Use**: Used to initialize and manage restoration operations, such as opening, closing, and handling data frames.


# Functions

### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/util/checkpt/test_checkpt_mmio.c#L32>)

Executes a series of tests for checkpoint and restore functionalities, including data handling, error checking, and frame style management.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments.
    - `argv`: An array of command-line arguments.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Calls `fd_boot` to initialize the environment with command-line arguments.
    - Checks for LZ4 support and logs a warning if not available.
    - Retrieves `--data-sz` and `--mmio-sz` from command-line arguments, defaulting to `BUF_MAX` if not specified.
    - Logs the sizes of data and MMIO being used.
    - Validates that `data_sz` and `mmio_sz` do not exceed `BUF_MAX`, logging an error if they do.
    - Initializes a random number generator `rng`.
    - Sets frame styles for raw and LZ4 based on LZ4 support.
    - Generates random test data and stores it in the `in` buffer.
    - Performs a series of tests on various checkpoint and restore functions, including `fd_checkpt_strerror`, `fd_checkpt_init_mmio`, `fd_checkpt_fini`, `fd_checkpt_open`, `fd_checkpt_close`, `fd_checkpt_meta`, `fd_checkpt_data`, `fd_restore_init_mmio`, `fd_restore_fini`, `fd_restore_open`, `fd_restore_close`, `fd_restore_meta`, `fd_restore_data`, `fd_restore_sz`, and `fd_restore_seek`.
    - Tests include handling of NULL pointers, misaligned memory, unsupported frame styles, and various data sizes.
    - Conducts end-to-end tests for checkpoint and restore operations with different buffer sizes and frame styles.
    - Tests non-trivial gather/scatter operations to stress test the LZ4 compressor and gather/scatter optimizations.
    - Logs the results of each test and halts the program with `fd_halt` after all tests pass.
- **Output**: Returns 0 upon successful completion of all tests.
