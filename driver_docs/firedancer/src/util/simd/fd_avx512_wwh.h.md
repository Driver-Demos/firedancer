Defines a vector ushort API using AVX-512 intrinsics for operations on 16-bit unsigned integers.

# Purpose
The code defines a set of macros and inline functions for handling 512-bit wide vector operations on unsigned 16-bit integers using AVX-512 instructions. It is part of a SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) utility library, specifically designed to work with vectors of unsigned short integers (`ushort`). The code is intended to be included indirectly through a header file named `fd_avx512.h`, as indicated by the preprocessor directive at the beginning. This ensures that the file is used in the correct context within a larger codebase.

The primary data type defined is `wwh_t`, which represents a 512-bit vector. The code provides predefined constants and memory operations for loading and storing these vectors, with functions that handle both aligned and unaligned memory. Arithmetic operations such as addition and subtraction are also defined using AVX-512 intrinsic functions. The use of macros and inline functions aims to optimize performance by leveraging the capabilities of the AVX-512 instruction set, while maintaining consistency with other similar APIs in the library.
# Functions

---
### wwh\_ld<!-- {{#callable:wwh_ld}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/util/simd/fd_avx512_wwh.h#L25>)

Loads a vector of 16 unsigned 16-bit integers from a 64-byte aligned memory location.
- **Inputs**:
    - `m`: A pointer to a 64-byte aligned memory location containing 16 unsigned 16-bit integers.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Uses the `_mm512_load_epi32` intrinsic to load data from the memory location pointed to by `m`.
- **Output**: A `wwh_t` vector containing the loaded 16 unsigned 16-bit integers.


---
### wwh\_st<!-- {{#callable:wwh_st}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/util/simd/fd_avx512_wwh.h#L26>)

Stores a 512-bit vector of unsigned 16-bit integers into a memory location.
- **Inputs**:
    - `m`: A pointer to a memory location where the 512-bit vector will be stored. It must be 64-byte aligned.
    - `x`: A 512-bit vector of unsigned 16-bit integers (`wwh_t`) to store at the memory location pointed to by `m`.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Uses the `_mm512_store_epi32` intrinsic to store the vector `x` into the memory location `m`.
- **Output**: No return value; the function modifies the memory location pointed to by `m`.


---
### wwh\_ldu<!-- {{#callable:wwh_ldu}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/util/simd/fd_avx512_wwh.h#L28>)

Loads a vector of 16 unsigned 16-bit integers from memory with arbitrary alignment.
- **Inputs**:
    - `m`: A pointer to the memory location from which to load the vector of unsigned 16-bit integers.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Uses the `_mm512_loadu_epi32` intrinsic to load data from the memory location pointed to by `m`.
    - The function returns the loaded vector as a `wwh_t` type.
- **Output**: A `wwh_t` type vector containing 16 unsigned 16-bit integers loaded from the specified memory location.


---
### wwh\_stu<!-- {{#callable:wwh_stu}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/util/simd/fd_avx512_wwh.h#L29>)

Stores a 512-bit vector of unsigned 16-bit integers into memory with arbitrary alignment.
- **Inputs**:
    - `m`: A pointer to the memory location where the vector will be stored. The memory can have arbitrary alignment.
    - `x`: A `wwh_t` type, which is a 512-bit vector containing 16 unsigned 16-bit integers.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Uses the `_mm512_storeu_epi32` intrinsic to store the vector `x` into the memory location pointed to by `m`.
- **Output**: No return value; the function performs a memory store operation.
