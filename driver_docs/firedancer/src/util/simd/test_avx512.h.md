Common functionality for AVX-512 unit tests, including macros for testing and assertions.

# Purpose
The code is a C header file that provides utility macros for testing AVX-512 SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) operations. It is intended to be included in other C source files that perform unit tests on AVX-512 functionality. The file defines several macros, such as `WWI_TEST`, `WWU_TEST`, `WWL_TEST`, `WWV_TEST`, and `WWB_TEST`, which are used to compare expected and actual results of SIMD operations across different data types, including integers, unsigned integers, long integers, unsigned long integers, and bytes. These macros facilitate the validation of SIMD operations by checking if the computed results match the expected values for each lane of the SIMD registers.

The file also includes static assertions to ensure that certain compile-time constants, such as `WW_WIDTH`, `WW_FOOTPRINT`, and `WW_ALIGN`, meet expected values, which are critical for the correct operation of the AVX-512 tests. Additionally, the file provides utility macros like `EXPAND_n` and `COMPARE_n` to assist in generating repetitive code patterns and comparing function outputs, respectively. These macros are designed to simplify the process of writing tests that require compile-time constants and to ensure that the functions being tested produce the correct results across multiple inputs. The header file does not define any public APIs or external interfaces but serves as a support tool for internal testing purposes.
