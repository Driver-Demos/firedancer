Tests for SSE 16x8 vector operations, including arithmetic, bit, logical, and conversion operations.

# Purpose
The code is a C program designed to test various vector operations on different data types, such as integers, floats, and bytes. It includes a [`main`](<#main>) function that initializes a random number generator and performs a series of tests on vector operations. These operations include arithmetic, bit manipulation, logical, conversion, and reduction operations on vectors. The program uses macros to simplify the expansion of vector indices and to invoke vector operations with different parameters.

The program defines several test functions, such as [`vc_test`](<#vc_test>), [`vf_test`](<#vf_test>), [`vi_test`](<#vi_test>), [`vu_test`](<#vu_test>), [`vd_test`](<#vd_test>), [`vl_test`](<#vl_test>), [`vv_test`](<#vv_test>), and [`vb_test`](<#vb_test>), which are used to verify the correctness of vector operations. It uses a loop to perform tests on a large number of random vector instances, ensuring that the operations produce the expected results. The code also includes macros for common operations like broadcasting, expanding, and exchanging vector elements. The program is structured to be executed as a standalone application, with the [`main`](<#main>) function serving as the entry point.
