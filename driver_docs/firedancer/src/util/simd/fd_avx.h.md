An API for vectorized C/C++ code using AVX intrinsics for various data types and operations.

# Purpose
This C header file provides an API for writing vectorized code using Intel's AVX (Advanced Vector Extensions) intrinsics. It supports operations on various data types, including 8-wide 32-bit integers, unsigned integers, and floats, as well as 4-wide 64-bit doubles, longs, and unsigned longs. The API offers vectorized equivalents for standard C/C++ operations, enabling efficient computation by leveraging single assembly instructions. It also includes utilities for transitioning between scalar and vector code and handling cross-lane data motion. The file acts as a wrapper around AVX intrinsics, providing a consistent type system and semantics, and facilitates porting vectorized code to non-Intel architectures by implementing these wrappers for different platforms. The header includes several other headers that provide specific support for different data types and operations.
