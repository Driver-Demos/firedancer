Defines macros and inline functions for AVX-512 vector operations on 8-bit unsigned integers.

# Purpose
The code defines a set of macros and inline functions for handling 512-bit wide vector operations using AVX-512 instructions. It is intended for use in environments where AVX-512 is supported, and it provides operations on vectors of unsigned 8-bit integers, also known as `uchar`. The file is not meant to be included directly; instead, it should be included through another header file, `fd_avx512.h`, as indicated by the preprocessor directive at the beginning of the file.

The code provides a variety of operations for constructing and manipulating vectors. It includes macros for creating vectors with specific patterns, such as broadcasting a single value across all lanes or repeating a sequence of values. It also defines bitwise operations like `and`, `or`, `xor`, and `not`, as well as shift operations. Additionally, the code provides memory operations for loading and storing vectors, with both aligned and unaligned versions. The use of macros and inline functions aims to optimize performance by leveraging AVX-512 intrinsic functions, ensuring efficient vector processing.
