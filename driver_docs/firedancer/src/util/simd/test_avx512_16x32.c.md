Tests for AVX-512 16x32 SIMD operations, including arithmetic, bitwise, and comparison functions.

# Purpose
The code is a C program designed to test the functionality of wide-word integer (`wwi_t`) and wide-word unsigned integer (`wwu_t`) operations using AVX-512 instructions. It includes a main function that initializes a random number generator and performs a series of tests on these data types. The tests cover a wide range of operations, including construction, permutation, selection, broadcasting, arithmetic operations, bitwise operations, and comparisons. The program uses macros such as `WWI_TEST` and `WWU_TEST` to verify the correctness of each operation by comparing the results against expected values.

The program is structured to repeatedly test the operations for a large number of iterations, ensuring thorough validation of the functionality. It includes tests for loading and storing data, arithmetic operations like addition and subtraction, bitwise operations like AND, OR, and XOR, and more complex operations like rotations and transpositions. The code also tests conditional operations and conversions between different data types. The use of AVX-512 instructions suggests that the program is optimized for high-performance computing environments where such vectorized operations can be leveraged for efficiency.

Executes a series of tests on wide word integer (`wwi_t`) and wide word unsigned integer (`wwu_t`) operations using random data.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments.
    - `argv`: An array of command-line arguments.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Initializes the system with `fd_boot` using `argc` and `argv`.
    - Creates a random number generator `rng` using `fd_rng_new` and `fd_rng_join`.
    - Logs the start of testing for `wwi_t`.
    - Runs a loop 1,000,000 times to test various operations on `wwi_t` using random integers.
    - Performs construction, permutation, selection, broadcast, arithmetic, bitwise, comparison, and lane operations on `wwi_t`.
    - Logs the start of testing for `wwu_t`.
    - Runs a loop 1,000,000 times to test various operations on `wwu_t` using random unsigned integers.
    - Performs similar operations as `wwi_t` on `wwu_t`, including byte swap and additional unsigned-specific operations.
    - Deletes the random number generator with `fd_rng_delete`.
    - Logs the completion of tests and calls `fd_halt` to terminate the program.
- **Output**: Returns 0 to indicate successful execution.
