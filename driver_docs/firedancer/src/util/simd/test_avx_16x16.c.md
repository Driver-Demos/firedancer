Tests for AVX 16x16 SIMD operations, including arithmetic, bit, and logical operations on short and ushort data types.

# Purpose
The code is a C program designed to test various operations on SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) vector types, specifically `ws_t` and `wh_t`, which are likely vector types for short and unsigned short integers, respectively. The program includes a [`main`](<#main>) function that initializes a random number generator and performs a series of tests on these vector types. It tests constructors, arithmetic operations, bit operations, and logical operations. The tests are conducted by generating random data, applying operations, and verifying the results using the `FD_TEST` macro.

The program is structured to perform exhaustive testing by iterating over a large number of test cases (65536 iterations) for each operation. It uses macros to simplify the expansion of vector elements and to define operations like shifts and rotations. The code includes placeholders for future improvements, such as proper typing and generalization of certain operations. The program is intended to be executed as a standalone test suite, as indicated by the presence of the [`main`](<#main>) function and the use of logging and halting functions (`FD_LOG_NOTICE` and `fd_halt`).

### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/util/simd/test_avx_16x16.c#L10>)

Initializes random number generation, performs a series of tests on wide SIMD operations for both signed and unsigned short integers, and logs the results.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments.
    - `argv`: An array of command-line arguments.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Calls `fd_boot` to initialize the environment with command-line arguments.
    - Defines macros for random number generation and index expansion.
    - Initializes a random number generator `rng`.
    - Defines and initializes arrays `si` and `hj` for storing test results.
    - Performs tests on wide SIMD operations for signed short integers (`ws_t`) using loops and macros.
    - Performs tests on wide SIMD operations for unsigned short integers (`wh_t`) using loops and macros.
    - Logs a notice message indicating the tests passed.
    - Calls `fd_halt` to terminate the program.
- **Output**: Returns 0 to indicate successful execution.

### wc\_test<!-- {{#callable_declaration:wc_test}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/util/simd/test_avx_16x16.c#L6>)

Tests the correctness of various operations on a `wc_t` type.
- **Description**: Use this function to verify that operations on a `wc_t` type produce expected results. It checks the packing, unpacking, extraction, insertion, and memory operations for correctness. This function is useful for testing and validation purposes in environments where `wc_t` operations are critical. Ensure that the input parameters are correctly set to represent the desired test conditions.
- **Inputs**:
    - `c`: A `wc_t` type representing the input condition to test. Must be a valid `wc_t` object.
    - `c0`: An integer representing the first bit to test. Must be 0 or 1.
    - `c1`: An integer representing the second bit to test. Must be 0 or 1.
    - `c2`: An integer representing the third bit to test. Must be 0 or 1.
    - `c3`: An integer representing the fourth bit to test. Must be 0 or 1.
    - `c4`: An integer representing the fifth bit to test. Must be 0 or 1.
    - `c5`: An integer representing the sixth bit to test. Must be 0 or 1.
    - `c6`: An integer representing the seventh bit to test. Must be 0 or 1.
    - `c7`: An integer representing the eighth bit to test. Must be 0 or 1.
- **Output**: Returns 1 if all tests pass, otherwise returns 0.
- **See Also**: [`wc_test`](<test_avx_common.c.md#wc_test>)  (Implementation)

### ws\_test<!-- {{#callable_declaration:ws_test}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/util/simd/test_avx_16x16.c#L7>)

Validates a `ws_t` vector against a reference array of shorts.
- **Description**: Use this function to verify that a `ws_t` vector matches a given reference array of 16 short integers. It checks each element of the vector against the corresponding element in the array. If all elements match, the function returns a success indicator. This function is useful for testing and validation purposes, ensuring that vector operations produce the expected results. The function assumes that the input array has at least 16 elements.
- **Inputs**:
    - `s`: A `ws_t` vector to validate. The function checks each element of this vector against the reference array.
    - `si`: A pointer to an array of 16 short integers. This array serves as the reference for validation. The function assumes the array has at least 16 elements and does not check for null pointers.
- **Output**: Returns 1 if the vector matches the reference array, otherwise returns 0.
- **See Also**: [`ws_test`](<test_avx_common.c.md#ws_test>)  (Implementation)

### wh\_test<!-- {{#callable_declaration:wh_test}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/util/simd/test_avx_16x16.c#L8>)

Validates a `wh_t` object against an array of `ushort` values.
- **Description**: Use this function to verify that a `wh_t` object matches a given sequence of `ushort` values. It checks if the elements extracted from the `wh_t` object correspond to the values in the provided array. This function is useful for testing or validation purposes where the integrity of the `wh_t` object against expected values is critical. Ensure that the `ushort` array has at least 16 elements, as the function will access indices 0 through 15. The function returns an integer indicating success or failure of the validation.
- **Inputs**:
    - `h`: A `wh_t` object to validate. The function expects this object to be initialized and contain data that can be compared against the `ushort` array.
    - `hj`: A pointer to an array of `ushort` values. The array must have at least 16 elements. The function will compare these values against the contents of the `wh_t` object. Passing a null pointer or an array with fewer than 16 elements will lead to undefined behavior.
- **Output**: Returns 1 if the `wh_t` object matches the `ushort` array, otherwise returns 0.
- **See Also**: [`wh_test`](<test_avx_common.c.md#wh_test>)  (Implementation)
