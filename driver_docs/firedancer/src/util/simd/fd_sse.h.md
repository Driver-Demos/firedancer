An API for vectorized C/C++ code using SSE intrinsics with support for various data types and operations.

# Purpose
The code is a C header file that provides an API for writing vectorized C/C++ code using Intel's SSE (Streaming SIMD Extensions) intrinsics. It supports operations on 4-wide 32-bit integers, unsigned integers, and floats, as well as 2-wide 64-bit doubles, longs, and unsigned longs. The API offers vectorized equivalents for standard C/C++ operations, enabling efficient computation through single assembly instructions. It also includes utilities for transitioning between scalar and vector code and handling cross-lane data motion. The header file acts as a thin wrapper around SSE intrinsics, providing a consistent type system and semantics for mixed-type and mixed-width vectorized code. It facilitates porting SSE-optimized code to non-Intel architectures by implementing the wrappers for the target platform. The file includes several other headers that provide specific support for different data types and operations.
