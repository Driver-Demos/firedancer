Defines macros and inline functions for AVX-512 vector operations on 32-bit unsigned integers.

# Purpose
The code defines a set of macros and inline functions for operations on 512-bit wide vectors of unsigned 32-bit integers using AVX-512 intrinsics. The primary data type used is `wwu_t`, which represents a vector where each lane holds an unsigned 32-bit integer. The code provides a comprehensive set of operations for constructing, manipulating, and performing arithmetic and logical operations on these vectors. These operations include vector construction, broadcasting, permutation, selection, memory operations, arithmetic operations (such as addition, subtraction, multiplication), binary operations (such as shifts, rotates, and bitwise operations), and comparison operations.

The code is intended to be included indirectly through a header file named `fd_avx512.h`, as indicated by the preprocessor directive at the beginning. It provides a low-level API for vector operations, leveraging AVX-512 instructions to perform operations on multiple data elements simultaneously. This is useful for applications requiring high-performance computing, such as scientific computations, data processing, and other tasks that can benefit from parallel processing capabilities. The code also includes utility functions for transposing matrices and converting between different vector types, enhancing its applicability in various computational scenarios.
