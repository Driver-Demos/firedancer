Defines macros and inline functions for AVX-512 vector operations on unsigned 64-bit integers.

# Purpose
The code defines a set of macros and inline functions for operations on 512-bit wide vectors using AVX-512 intrinsics. It focuses on handling vectors of unsigned 64-bit integers, referred to as `wwv_t`. The code provides a comprehensive API for constructing, manipulating, and performing arithmetic, binary, and comparison operations on these vectors. It includes constructors for creating vectors, predefined constants, memory operations for loading and storing vectors, and a variety of arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and more. Additionally, it provides binary operations like bitwise AND, OR, XOR, and shift operations, as well as conditional operations and conversions between different data types.

The code is intended to be included indirectly through another header file, as indicated by the initial preprocessor directive. It is designed to be used in environments that support AVX-512 instructions, providing efficient vectorized operations for high-performance computing tasks. The use of macros and inline functions aims to optimize performance by reducing function call overhead and allowing the compiler to better optimize the code. The code also includes utility functions for vector permutation, selection, and transposition, which are useful for complex data manipulation tasks.
