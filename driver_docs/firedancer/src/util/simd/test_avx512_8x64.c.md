Tests for AVX-512 8x64 SIMD operations, including arithmetic, bitwise, and comparison functions.

# Purpose
The code is a C program designed to test various operations on two data types, `wwl_t` and `wwv_t`, which are likely vector types representing collections of long integers and unsigned long integers, respectively. The program includes a main function that initializes a random number generator and performs a series of tests on these vector types. The tests cover a wide range of operations, including construction, permutation, selection, broadcasting, arithmetic operations, bitwise operations, comparisons, and conversions. Each operation is tested using randomly generated data to ensure correctness.

The program is structured to execute a large number of iterations (1,000,000) for each type, ensuring thorough testing. It uses macros such as `WWL_TEST` and `WWV_TEST` to verify the results of operations against expected values. The code also includes tests for more complex operations like vector transposition and sliding, as well as specialized operations like `madd52lo` and `madd52hi`, which involve modular arithmetic. The program logs the progress of the tests and concludes by cleaning up the random number generator resources before halting. This code is intended to be an executable test suite for validating the functionality and correctness of the `wwl_t` and `wwv_t` vector operations.

Executes a series of tests on `wwl_t` and `wwv_t` data types, including construction, permutation, arithmetic, bitwise, and comparison operations, using random number generation and logging.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments.
    - `argv`: An array of command-line arguments.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Initializes the environment with `fd_boot` and sets up a random number generator `rng`.
    - Logs the start of testing for `wwl_t`.
    - Runs a loop 1,000,000 times to test various operations on `wwl_t` data type, including construction, permutation, selection, broadcasting, arithmetic, bitwise, and comparison operations.
    - Logs the start of testing for `wwv_t`.
    - Runs a loop 1,000,000 times to test various operations on `wwv_t` data type, similar to `wwl_t`.
    - Deletes the random number generator and logs the completion of tests.
    - Calls `fd_halt` to terminate the program.
- **Output**: Returns 0 to indicate successful execution.
