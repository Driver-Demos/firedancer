Tests for AVX 8x32 SIMD operations, including constructors, arithmetic, logical, and conversion functions.

# Purpose
The code is a C test suite designed to validate the functionality of various vector operations using AVX (Advanced Vector Extensions) instructions. It includes tests for different data types such as `wc_t` (likely a vector of boolean values), `wf_t` (vector of floats), `wi_t` (vector of integers), `wu_t` (vector of unsigned integers), `wd_t` (vector of doubles), `wl_t` (vector of longs), and `wv_t` (vector of unsigned longs). The test suite performs a wide range of operations including construction, arithmetic, logical, bit manipulation, and conversion operations on these vector types. Each operation is tested for correctness by comparing the results against expected values.

The code is structured to run a series of tests within the [`main`](<#main>) function, which initializes a random number generator and then executes tests for each vector type. The tests include operations such as broadcasting, logical negation, arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), bitwise operations (AND, OR, XOR, NOT), and conversions between different vector types. The results of these operations are validated using the `FD_TEST` macro, which likely checks if the operation's output matches the expected result. The code also includes macros for generating random values and performing vector operations, ensuring comprehensive coverage of the vector functionalities. The test suite concludes by logging a "pass" message if all tests are successful.
