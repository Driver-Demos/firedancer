Tests AVX-512 64x8 SIMD operations using random data and various bit manipulation functions.

# Purpose
The code is a C program designed to test various operations on a data type `wwb_t`, which appears to be related to wide bit manipulation, possibly using AVX-512 instructions. The program includes a main function that initializes a random number generator and defines several macros to facilitate testing. It performs a series of tests on operations such as broadcasting, exchanging, and bit manipulation (e.g., NOT, AND, OR, XOR) on arrays of unsigned characters (`uchar`). The tests are executed in a loop, iterating 65,536 times, to ensure the correctness of the operations under various conditions.

The program uses macros to expand indices and invoke operations on the `wwb_t` type, which suggests that the operations are vectorized or involve SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) processing. The code includes a series of tests labeled as `WWB_TEST`, which likely verify the results of operations against expected values. The program concludes by cleaning up the random number generator and logging a notice that the tests have passed before halting execution. The inclusion of the header file `test_avx512.h` indicates that the program is part of a larger test suite focused on AVX-512 functionality.

Initializes a random number generator, performs a series of tests on wide word bit operations, and logs the results.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments.
    - `argv`: An array of command-line argument strings.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Calls `fd_boot` to initialize the environment with command-line arguments.
    - Creates a random number generator `rng` using `fd_rng_new` and `fd_rng_join`.
    - Defines a macro `brand` to generate random unsigned characters in the range [253, 254, 255, 0, 1, 2, 3].
    - Initializes an array `ti` of 64 unsigned characters.
    - Defines macros for expanding indices and invoking functions with expanded arguments.
    - Performs tests on wide word bit operations using the `WWB_TEST` macro, iterating 65536 times.
    - In each iteration, initializes arrays `xi`, `yi`, and `ci` with random values and constructs wide word bit objects `x`, `y`, and `c`.
    - Tests various bit operations such as broadcast, exchange, not, shift, and logical operations using the `WWB_TEST` macro.
    - Deletes the random number generator using `fd_rng_delete` and `fd_rng_leave`.
    - Logs a notice message "pass" using `FD_LOG_NOTICE`.
    - Calls `fd_halt` to terminate the program.
- **Output**: Returns 0 to indicate successful execution.
- **Functions Called**:
    - [`wwb_bcast_pair`](<fd_avx512_wwb.h.md#wwb_bcast_pair>)
    - [`wwb_bcast_quad`](<fd_avx512_wwb.h.md#wwb_bcast_quad>)
    - [`wwb_bcast_oct`](<fd_avx512_wwb.h.md#wwb_bcast_oct>)
    - [`wwb_bcast_hex`](<fd_avx512_wwb.h.md#wwb_bcast_hex>)
