Defines headers and unit tests for SSE, AVX, and AVX512 SIMD operations based on availability.

# Purpose
The provided content is a Makefile script that manages the inclusion of header files and the execution of unit tests for different SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) instruction sets: SSE, AVX, and AVX512. The script uses conditional statements to check for the presence of specific instruction set support, such as `FD_HAS_SSE`, `FD_HAS_AVX`, and `FD_HAS_AVX512`. If the support is available, it adds the corresponding header files using the `add-hdrs` function and defines unit tests with the `make-unit-test` function. The script then executes these unit tests using the `run-unit-test` function to ensure the functionality of the code associated with each instruction set. This setup helps in maintaining and verifying the code's compatibility with different SIMD instruction sets.
