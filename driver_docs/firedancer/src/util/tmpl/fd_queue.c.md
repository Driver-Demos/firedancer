Implements a single-threaded, compile-time fixed-capacity queue for high-performance contexts.

# Purpose
The code defines a template for creating a single-threaded, compile-time fixed-capacity queue in C, designed for high-performance contexts. It allows users to define a queue with specific parameters by setting the `QUEUE_NAME`, `QUEUE_T`, and `QUEUE_MAX` macros before including the file. This setup generates a set of queue operations tailored to the specified element type and maximum capacity. The queue operations include basic functionalities such as creating, joining, and deleting a queue, as well as accessing and modifying elements within the queue. The API provides both simple operations like `push` and `pop`, and advanced zero-copy operations like `peek_insert` and `peek_remove`, which allow direct access to queue elements without additional copying.

The queue implementation uses a circular buffer approach, where the `start` and `end` indices manage the positions for popping and pushing elements, respectively. The queue is designed to handle overflow and underflow efficiently, especially when the maximum size is a power of two. The code does not include error checking for performance reasons, and it assumes that the user will ensure the queue's constraints are respected, such as not exceeding the maximum capacity during operations. The implementation is encapsulated within a private structure, and the API functions provide access to the queue's state and operations, ensuring that the queue can be used efficiently in high-performance applications.

### QUEUE\_<!-- {{#callable:QUEUE_}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/util/tmpl/fd_queue.c#L224>)

Resets the queue to an empty state by setting the start and end indices to a large value.
- **Inputs**:
    - `queue`: A pointer to the queue to be cleared.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Retrieve the private header of the queue using `QUEUE_(private_hdr_from_queue)` function.
    - Set the `start` and `end` indices of the queue header to `1UL << 63`, effectively marking the queue as empty.
- **Output**: Returns the pointer to the queue that has been cleared.
- **Functions Called**:
    - [`QUEUE_`](<#queue_>)
