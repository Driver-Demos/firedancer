Functions for a single-threaded, fixed-capacity stack optimized for high-performance contexts.

# Purpose
The code defines a template for implementing a single-threaded, fixed-capacity stack in C, designed for high-performance contexts. It uses preprocessor directives to allow customization of the stack's name and element type through the `STACK_NAME` and `STACK_T` macros. This template provides a comprehensive API for stack operations, including creation, joining, leaving, and deletion of stacks, as well as basic operations like push and pop. It also includes advanced operations for zero-copy usage, such as peek, insert, and remove, which are optimized for performance by avoiding error checking.

The stack is implemented as a structure containing metadata about its capacity and current element count, along with an array to store the elements. The API functions operate on this structure, providing accessors to query the stack's state, such as its maximum capacity, current count, and availability. The code is intended to be included in other C files, where it can be instantiated with specific types and names, allowing for flexible integration into various applications. The design emphasizes performance by requiring the caller to ensure that operations are performed within valid bounds, thus avoiding runtime checks.

### STACK\_<!-- {{#callable:STACK_}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/util/tmpl/fd_stack.c#L177>)

Resets the stack's element count to zero, effectively removing all elements.
- **Inputs**:
    - `stack`: A pointer to the stack from which all elements will be removed.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Call `STACK_(private_hdr_from_stack)` to get the stack's private header from the given `stack` pointer.
    - Set the `cnt` field of the stack's private header to `0UL`, indicating the stack is empty.
    - Return the original `stack` pointer.
- **Output**: Returns the original stack pointer after removing all elements.
- **Functions Called**:
    - [`STACK_`](<#stack_>)
