Tests for various sorting algorithms, including insertion, stable, and in-place sorts, using random data.

# Purpose
The code is a C program designed to test various sorting algorithms. It includes functionality for sorting arrays of `float` type in both ascending and descending order using different methods. The program defines several sorting functions by including the `fd_sort.c` file with different configurations, such as `sort_up` and `sort_dn`, which sort in ascending and descending order, respectively. The code also includes a [`shuffle`](<#shuffle>) function to randomize the order of elements in an array, which is used to test the robustness of the sorting algorithms.

The [`main`](<#main>) function initializes a random number generator and sets up arrays to test the sorting functions. It performs a series of tests on different sorting methods, including insertion sort, stable sort, and in-place sort, for various array sizes. The tests verify that the sorting functions correctly sort arrays by comparing the sorted output to a reference array. The program logs the results of each test and ensures that the sorting functions behave as expected under different conditions. The code also includes a test for a search function, `sort_up_search_geq`, which finds the first element in a sorted array that is greater than or equal to a given value. The program concludes by cleaning up resources and exiting.

# Functions

### shuffle<!-- {{#callable:shuffle}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/util/tmpl/test_sort.c#L19>)

Randomly shuffles elements from the source array `x` into the destination array `y` using a given random number generator.
- **Inputs**:
    - `rng`: A pointer to a random number generator of type `fd_rng_t` used to generate random indices.
    - `y`: A pointer to the destination array of type `TYPE` where the shuffled elements will be stored.
    - `x`: A pointer to the source array of type `TYPE` containing the elements to shuffle.
    - `cnt`: An unsigned long integer representing the number of elements to shuffle.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Iterates over each element in the source array `x` up to `cnt` elements.
    - Copies the current element from `x` to the corresponding position in `y`.
    - Generates a random index `j` using the random number generator `rng`, ensuring `j` is within the range of already processed elements.
    - Swaps the element at the current index `i` in `y` with the element at the random index `j`.
- **Output**: Returns a pointer to the shuffled destination array `y`.

### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/util/tmpl/test_sort.c#L35>)

Tests various sorting algorithms on arrays of floats using different methods and logs the results.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments.
    - `argv`: An array of command-line arguments.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Initializes the random number generator and sets up arrays for reference, test, and temporary data.
    - Iterates over different array sizes and tests sorting algorithms `sort_up_insert`, `sort_dn_insert`, `sort_up_stable_fast`, `sort_dn_stable_fast`, `sort_up_stable`, `sort_dn_stable`, `sort_up_inplace`, `sort_dn_inplace`, `sort_up_select`, and `sort_dn_select`.
    - For each sorting algorithm, tests are conducted on arrays initialized in ascending, descending, and shuffled order.
    - Uses `FD_TEST` to verify that the sorted arrays match the expected reference arrays.
    - Logs the results of each test using `FD_LOG_NOTICE`.
    - Performs additional tests with random data to ensure sorting algorithms work under various conditions.
    - Cleans up by deleting the random number generator and halting the program.
- **Output**: Returns 0 to indicate successful execution.
- **Functions Called**:
    - [`shuffle`](<#shuffle>)
