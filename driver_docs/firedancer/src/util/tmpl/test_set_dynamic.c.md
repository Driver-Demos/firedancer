Tests for dynamic set operations, including creation, manipulation, and validation of sets.

# Purpose
The code is a C program designed to test the functionality of a dynamic set data structure. It includes various operations such as insertion, removal, union, intersection, and complement of sets. The program initializes a random number generator and uses a scratch memory space for temporary data storage. It performs a series of tests to verify the correctness of set operations, ensuring that the set behaves as expected under different conditions. The program also includes checks for memory alignment and footprint requirements, and it logs warnings if these conditions are not met.

The main function initializes the environment and sets up the necessary resources, such as random number generation and scratch memory. It then creates multiple sets and performs a series of operations to test their behavior. The tests include checking if sets are null or full, comparing sets for equality, and verifying subset relationships. The program also tests the iteration over set elements and the correct handling of edge cases, such as inserting or removing elements at the boundaries of the set. The code is structured to run in a hosted environment, with conditional compilation directives to include necessary system headers and handle process forking for certain tests.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `../fd_util.h`
- `sys/types.h`
- `sys/wait.h`
- `unistd.h`
- `fd_set_dynamic.c`


# Global Variables

---
### scratch\_smem
- **Type**: ``uchar[]``
- **Description**: An array of unsigned characters with a size defined by `SCRATCH_SZ`, which is 65536 bytes. The array is aligned according to `FD_SCRATCH_SMEM_ALIGN` to ensure proper memory alignment for performance or hardware requirements.
- **Use**: Used as a scratch memory space for temporary data storage during operations in the program.


---
### scratch\_fmem
- **Type**: ``ulong``
- **Description**: Represents a static array of type `ulong` with a single element. It is used as part of the scratch memory setup in the program.
- **Use**: Used in the `fd_scratch_attach` function to provide a memory area for scratch operations.


# Functions

### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/util/tmpl/test_set_dynamic.c#L15>)

Initializes and tests various set operations using a dynamic set implementation with random number generation and scratch memory management.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments.
    - `argv`: An array of command-line argument strings.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Calls `fd_boot` to initialize the environment with command-line arguments.
    - Initializes a random number generator `rng` using `fd_rng_new` and `fd_rng_join`.
    - Attaches and pushes scratch memory using `fd_scratch_attach` and `fd_scratch_push`.
    - Parses the `--max` command-line argument to determine the maximum value for set operations, defaulting to 12345 if not provided.
    - Checks if `max` is less than 2 and logs a warning if true, then exits.
    - Calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to `max` and stores it in `sum_full`.
    - Determines alignment and footprint for set operations and checks if they fit within the scratch space.
    - Creates and joins multiple sets (`null`, `f0`, `f1`, `full`, `n0`, `n1`, `e`, `ebar`, `t`) using `set_new` and `set_join`.
    - Performs various set operations and tests, including `set_full`, `set_ele`, `set_complement`, `set_valid`, `set_cnt`, `set_is_null`, `set_is_full`, `set_first`, `set_copy`, `set_insert`, `set_remove`, `set_union`, `set_intersect`, `set_subtract`, `set_xor`, and `set_if`.
    - Iterates over sets to calculate sums and validate set operations using `set_iter_init`, `set_iter_done`, `set_iter_next`, `set_const_iter_init`, `set_const_iter_done`, and `set_const_iter_next`.
    - Performs random set operations in a loop, including `set_null`, `set_insert`, `set_insert_if`, `set_union`, `set_intersect`, `set_subtract`, `set_range`, `set_insert_range`, `set_select_range`, `set_remove_range`, and `set_range_cnt`.
    - Tests critical logging behavior with `FD_EXPECT_LOG_CRIT` if hosted and handholding is enabled.
    - Deletes and leaves all sets using `set_delete` and `set_leave`.
    - Pops and detaches scratch memory using `fd_scratch_pop` and `fd_scratch_detach`.
    - Deletes the random number generator using `fd_rng_delete` and `fd_rng_leave`.
    - Logs a notice indicating the test passed and calls `fd_halt` before returning 0.
- **Output**: Returns 0 to indicate successful execution.
