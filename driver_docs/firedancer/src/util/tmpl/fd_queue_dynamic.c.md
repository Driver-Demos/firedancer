Functions for a single-threaded, fixed-capacity queue optimized for high-performance contexts.

# Purpose
The code defines a template for implementing a single-threaded, fixed-capacity queue in C, designed for high-performance contexts. It provides a set of macros and functions that allow users to create a queue with a specified name and element type. The queue operations include creating a new queue, joining and leaving a queue, and deleting a queue. The code also provides accessor functions to check the queue's maximum capacity, current element count, available space, and whether the queue is empty or full.

The queue supports both simple and advanced operations. Simple operations include pushing and popping elements, while advanced operations allow for zero-copy usage, such as peeking at the most recent or least recent insertions and performing uninitialized insertions or removals. The implementation uses a private structure to manage the queue's state, including the maximum number of elements, the current count of elements, and the indices for the next push and pop operations. The code does not perform error checking, and it assumes that the caller ensures the queue's constraints are met, such as not exceeding the maximum capacity during push operations.

### QUEUE\_<!-- {{#callable:QUEUE_}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/util/tmpl/fd_queue_dynamic.c#L229>)

Resets the queue to an empty state by setting the count, start, and end indices to zero.
- **Inputs**:
    - `queue`: A pointer to the queue to be cleared.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Retrieve the private header of the queue using `QUEUE_(private_hdr_from_queue)` function.
    - Set the `cnt` (count of elements) in the header to 0.
    - Set the `start` index in the header to 0.
    - Set the `end` index in the header to 0.
    - Return the original queue pointer.
- **Output**: Returns the pointer to the queue that has been reset.
- **Functions Called**:
    - [`QUEUE_`](<#queue_>)
