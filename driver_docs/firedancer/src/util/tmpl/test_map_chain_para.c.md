Tests for concurrent operations and error handling on a parallel map and pool implementation.

# Purpose
The code is a C program that tests the functionality of a concurrent map and pool data structure. It includes the definition of a structure `myele` and its associated type `myele_t`, which is used as the element type for both a pool and a map. The program uses macros to configure and include parameterized implementations of a pool (`fd_pool_para.c`) and a map (`fd_map_chain_para.c`). The map uses a hash function and supports memoization, and the code includes static assertions to verify the correctness of various map-related constants.

The main functionality of the program is implemented in the [`main`](<#main>) function and the [`tile_main`](<#tile_main>) function. The [`main`](<#main>) function initializes the environment, sets up the shared memory for the pool and map, and tests the map's construction, accessors, and concurrent operations across multiple tiles. The [`tile_main`](<#tile_main>) function performs various operations on the map, such as inserting, removing, modifying, and querying elements, while handling potential errors and concurrency issues. The program also includes a shared memory allocator and a random number generator to support these operations. The code is structured to test the map's behavior under different conditions and configurations, ensuring its reliability and correctness in a concurrent environment.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `../fd_util.h`
- `fd_pool_para.c`
- `fd_map_chain_para.c`


# Global Variables

---
### shmem
- **Type**: ``uchar[]``
- **Description**: A static array of unsigned characters with a size defined by `SHMEM_MAX`. It is used to manage shared memory allocations within the program.
- **Use**: Stores shared memory data and is used by the `shmem_alloc` function to allocate memory blocks.


---
### shmem\_cnt
- **Type**: ``ulong``
- **Description**: `shmem_cnt` is a static global variable of type `ulong` that tracks the current offset in the shared memory array `shmem`. It is initialized to 0UL.
- **Use**: Used to manage memory allocation within the `shmem` array by updating the offset after each allocation.


---
### tile\_pool
- **Type**: `mypool_t *`
- **Description**: A pointer to a memory pool structure used for managing elements of type `myele_t`. The pool is used to allocate and manage memory for elements that are inserted into or removed from a map.
- **Use**: Used to manage memory allocation for elements in a concurrent map operation.


---
### tile\_map
- **Type**: ``mymap_t *``
- **Description**: A pointer to a `mymap_t` structure, which is a map data structure used to manage elements of type `myele_t`. The map is implemented using a chain-based approach, as indicated by the inclusion of `fd_map_chain_para.c`. The map supports operations such as insert, remove, modify, and query on elements identified by a key of type `uint`. The map also uses memoization to optimize key lookups.
- **Use**: Used to store and manage a collection of `myele_t` elements, allowing concurrent operations on the map in a multi-threaded environment.


---
### tile\_ele\_max
- **Type**: `ulong`
- **Description**: `tile_ele_max` is a static global variable of type `ulong` that stores the maximum number of elements that can be handled by the tile in the program.
- **Use**: It is used to define the limit of elements for operations within the tile context.


---
### tile\_iter\_cnt
- **Type**: ``ulong``
- **Description**: Stores the number of iterations to perform in the `tile_main` function.
- **Use**: Used to control the loop that performs concurrent operations on the map in the `tile_main` function.


---
### tile\_go
- **Type**: ``ulong``
- **Description**: A static global variable of type `ulong`.
- **Use**: Used as a flag to control the execution flow in the `tile_main` function, specifically to signal when to start concurrent operations.


# Data Structures

---
### myele
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - ``mykey``: Stores a key value of type `uint`.
    - ``mynext``: Stores the index of the next element in a linked list, of type `uint`.
    - ``mod``: Stores a modifier value of type `uint`.
    - ``val``: Stores a value of type `uint`.
    - ``mymemo``: Stores a memoization value of type `ulong`.
- **Description**: Defines a structure `myele` that represents an element in a data structure, with fields for a key, a next index for linked list traversal, a modifier, a value, and a memoization field. This structure is used in conjunction with a pool and map implementation to manage elements in a concurrent environment.


---
### myele\_t
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - ``mykey``: Stores the key for the element.
    - ``mynext``: Stores the index of the next element in a linked list.
    - ``mod``: Stores a modification counter or version number.
    - ``val``: Stores a value associated with the element.
    - ``mymemo``: Stores a memoization value for the element.
- **Description**: Defines a structure for an element in a data pool or map, with fields for key management, linked list navigation, versioning, value storage, and memoization.


# Functions

---
### shmem\_alloc<!-- {{#callable:shmem_alloc}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/util/tmpl/test_map_chain_para.c#L52>)

Allocates memory from a shared memory pool with specified alignment and size.
- **Inputs**:
    - `a`: The alignment requirement for the memory allocation.
    - `s`: The size of the memory to allocate.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Aligns the current position in the shared memory (`shmem`) to the specified alignment `a` using `fd_ulong_align_up` function.
    - Calculates the new position in the shared memory after allocation by adding the aligned position and the size `s`.
    - Updates the `shmem_cnt` to reflect the new position in the shared memory.
    - Checks if the updated `shmem_cnt` does not exceed the maximum allowed size `SHMEM_MAX` using `FD_TEST`.
    - Returns a pointer to the aligned memory location.
- **Output**: A pointer to the allocated memory block with the specified alignment and size.
