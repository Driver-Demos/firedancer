Macros and functions for creating compile-time perfect hash tables with error checking for hash function validity.

# Purpose
The code defines macros and functions to create compile-time perfect hash tables in C. A perfect hash table is a data structure that allows for constant-time lookups without collisions. The code uses the C preprocessor to enforce that the hash function results in a perfect hash table, failing to compile if it does not. This ensures that the hash function is correct at compile time. The code supports hash tables with or without values, allowing it to function as a set for containment queries.

The code requires the user to define several macros to customize the hash table, such as `MAP_PERFECT_NAME`, `MAP_PERFECT_LG_TBL_SZ`, and `MAP_PERFECT_T`. These macros specify the table's name, size, and element type, respectively. The code provides static inline functions for checking if a key is in the table, querying an element by key, and obtaining the hash of a key. The hash function can be customized, but the default implementation uses a simple multiplication and bit-shift operation. The code is designed to be included in a C source file and can be used multiple times within a compilation unit, provided that different instances have unique names.

### MAP\_PERFECT\_<!-- {{#callable:MAP_PERFECT_}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/util/tmpl/fd_map_perfect.c#L402>)

Computes the hash of a key using a perfect hash function and returns the hash if the key is in the table, or `UINT_MAX` if not.
- **Inputs**:
    - `key`: The key to query in the perfect hash table, of type `MAP_PERFECT_KEY_T`.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Compute the hash of the input `key` using the `MAP_PERFECT_HASH_R` function.
    - Check if the key at the computed hash index in the table is equal to the input `key` using `MAP_PERFECT_KEYS_EQUAL`.
    - Return the computed hash if the key is contained in the table, otherwise return `UINT_MAX`.
- **Output**: Returns the hash of the key if it is in the table, or `UINT_MAX` if the key is not in the table.
- **Functions Called**:
    - [`MAP_PERFECT_`](<#map_perfect_>)
