Unit tests for B+ tree operations, including insertion, deletion, and querying, using a custom memory allocator.

# Purpose
This code is a C program that tests the functionality of a B+ tree data structure. The program includes a main function, which serves as the entry point for execution. It uses a custom memory allocator defined by the `ALLOC` macro to manage memory for the B+ tree operations. The B+ tree is configured with specific parameters such as `BPLUS_TREE_MAX` and `BPLUS_PAIR_MAX`, which define the maximum number of nodes and pairs, respectively. The program includes various test cases to verify the correctness of B+ tree operations, including insertion, deletion, querying, and iteration over the tree elements.

The code defines a `pair` structure and a corresponding type `pair_t` to store key-value pairs, where both the key and value are of type `ulong`. The [`ulong_cmp`](<#ulong_cmp>) function is used to compare keys within the B+ tree. The program uses a series of macros to configure the B+ tree, such as `BPLUS_NAME`, `BPLUS_KEY_T`, and `BPLUS_PAIR_T`, and includes the `fd_bplus.c` file, which likely contains the implementation of the B+ tree. The main function initializes the environment, sets up random number generation, and performs a series of tests to ensure the B+ tree behaves as expected under various conditions. These tests include checking the tree's ability to handle edge cases, such as empty and full states, and verifying the integrity of the tree structure through operations like `bplus_verify`.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `../fd_util.h`
- `fd_bplus.c`


# Global Variables

---
### mem
- **Type**: ``uchar[]``
- **Description**: An array of unsigned characters (`uchar`) with a size defined by `MEM_SZ`, which is 1048576 bytes. The array is aligned to `MEM_ALIGN`, which is 128 bytes.
- **Use**: Used as a memory buffer for dynamic allocations within the program.


---
### mem\_used
- **Type**: ``ulong``
- **Description**: `mem_used` is a static global variable of type `ulong` that tracks the amount of memory used in the `mem` array. It is initialized to 0 and is updated in multiples of `MEM_ALIGN`.
- **Use**: Tracks the memory usage in the `mem` array for allocation purposes.


# Data Structures

---
### pair
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `mykey`: Stores the key of the pair as an unsigned long integer.
    - `myval`: Stores the value of the pair as an unsigned long integer.
- **Description**: Defines a simple data structure that holds a key-value pair, where both the key and the value are of type `ulong`. This structure is used to represent pairs of data, typically for use in data structures like B-trees or hash tables, where each pair consists of a unique key and an associated value.


---
### pair\_t
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - ``mykey``: Stores the key of the pair as an unsigned long integer.
    - ``myval``: Stores the value of the pair as an unsigned long integer.
- **Description**: Defines a simple data structure that holds a key-value pair, where both the key and the value are of type `ulong`. This structure is used to represent pairs of data, typically for use in data structures like B-trees, where each pair consists of a key for sorting and a value for storage.


# Functions

---
### ulong\_cmp<!-- {{#callable:ulong_cmp}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/util/tmpl/test_bplus.c#L10>)

Compares two unsigned long integers and returns an integer indicating their relative order.
- **Inputs**:
    - `_a`: Pointer to the first unsigned long integer to compare.
    - `_b`: Pointer to the second unsigned long integer to compare.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Dereferences the pointers `_a` and `_b` to obtain the unsigned long values `a` and `b`.
    - Checks if `a` is less than `b`; if true, returns -1.
    - Checks if `a` is greater than `b`; if true, returns 1.
    - If neither condition is true, returns 0, indicating `a` and `b` are equal.
- **Output**: An integer: -1 if the first number is less than the second, 1 if greater, and 0 if they are equal.


---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/util/tmpl/test_bplus.c#L46>)

Initializes and tests a B+ tree data structure with various operations and configurations.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments.
    - `argv`: An array of command-line argument strings.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Calls `fd_boot` to initialize the environment with command-line arguments.
    - Extracts `ele_max_est`, `node_max`, and `leaf_max` from command-line arguments or defaults.
    - Initializes a random number generator `rng`.
    - Logs the testing parameters for `ele_max_est`, `node_max`, and `leaf_max`.
    - Allocates memory for `pair` array and initializes `pair_cnt`.
    - Performs various tests on B+ tree construction, including alignment and footprint checks.
    - Allocates shared memory `shmem` for the B+ tree and tests `bplus_new` and `bplus_join` functions.
    - Fills the B+ tree with elements up to its limits and verifies the insertion and querying of elements.
    - Performs a series of operations on the B+ tree, including queries, inserts, upserts, and removals, using a random operation selector.
    - Tests B+ tree iterators for whole and range operations.
    - Flushes the B+ tree and verifies it is empty.
    - Tests the destruction of the B+ tree and cleans up resources.
    - Logs a success message and halts the program.
- **Output**: Returns 0 to indicate successful execution.
