Header-only API for fast manipulation of index sets using primitive unsigned integer types.

# Purpose
The code defines a header-only API for manipulating index sets using a primitive unsigned integer type. It provides a collection of functions and macros to create, modify, and query sets of indices, where the set is represented as a bitmask within an integer type. The API allows for operations such as creating empty or full sets, adding or removing elements, and performing set operations like union, intersection, and difference. It also includes functions for iterating over set elements and handling ranges of indices efficiently.

The API is designed to be included in a compilation unit by defining a `SET_NAME` and optionally other parameters like `SET_TYPE`, `SET_MAX`, and `SET_IDX_T` to customize the behavior and constraints of the set. The code uses macros to generate type-specific functions and ensures that the operations are efficient by leveraging bitwise operations. The API is safe for multiple inclusions and provides options for fine-tuning through preprocessor directives. It assumes valid inputs for most operations, with some functions providing checks for validity when a specific flag (`FD_TMPL_USE_HANDHOLDING`) is enabled.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `../bits/fd_bits.h`
- `../log/fd_log.h`


# Global Variables

---
### SET\_
- **Type**: `macro`
- **Description**: The `SET_` macro is used to concatenate the `SET_NAME` with a given suffix, effectively creating a unique identifier for set-related operations. It is defined as `FD_EXPAND_THEN_CONCAT3(SET_NAME,_,x)`, where `x` is the suffix to be appended.
- **Use**: Used to generate unique identifiers for set operations by appending a suffix to `SET_NAME`.


# Functions

---
### SET\_<!-- {{#callable:SET_}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/util/tmpl/fd_smallset.c#L250>)

Counts the number of elements in a set within a specified range.
- **Inputs**:
    - ``x``: The set represented as a primitive unsigned integer type.
    - ``l``: The lower bound of the range (inclusive).
    - ``h``: The upper bound of the range (exclusive).
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Compute the range mask by calling `SET_(range)(l,h)` to get a set with elements in the range [l, h).
    - Perform a bitwise AND operation between `x` and the range mask to isolate elements within the specified range.
    - Use `SET_POPCNT` to count the number of set bits in the result, which represents the number of elements in the range.
- **Output**: Returns the count of elements in the set `x` that fall within the range [l, h).
- **Functions Called**:
    - [`SET_`](<#set_>)
