Header-only API for fast manipulation of versioned offsets using atomic operation-friendly types.

# Purpose
The code defines a header-only API for manipulating versioned offsets, which are useful in interprocess lock-free algorithms. The API allows users to define a custom type for versioned offsets by specifying a name through the [`VOFF_NAME`](<#voff_name>) macro. The versioned offset is represented as a pair of version and offset packed into a single unsigned integer type, which is atomic operation friendly. The code provides macros and functions to define the bit width for the version and offset, calculate their maximum values, and pack and unpack the version and offset from the custom type.

The API is designed to be flexible and efficient, allowing users to specify the underlying type (`VOFF_TYPE`) and the bit width for the version (`VOFF_VER_WIDTH`). By default, `VOFF_TYPE` is set to `ulong`, and `VOFF_VER_WIDTH` is set to 20 bits, leaving the remaining bits for the offset. The code includes inline functions to retrieve the bit widths and maximum values for the version and offset, as well as to pack and unpack these values into and from the custom type. The design ensures that the API is safe for multiple inclusions and can be fine-tuned for specific use cases.
# Functions

---
### VOFF\_<!-- {{#callable:VOFF_}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/util/tmpl/fd_voff.c#L72>)

Extracts the offset component from a versioned offset by right-shifting the input value.
- **Inputs**:
    - ``voff``: A versioned offset of type `VOFF_(t)` from which the offset component is extracted.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Right-shift the input `voff` by `VOFF_VER_WIDTH` bits to isolate the offset component.
- **Output**: Returns the offset component of the versioned offset as a `VOFF_TYPE`.
- **Functions Called**:
    - [`VOFF_`](<#voff_>)


---
### VOFF\_NAME<!-- {{#callable:VOFF_NAME}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/util/tmpl/fd_voff.c#L65>)

Packs the least significant bits of a version and offset into a single `VOFF_TYPE` value.
- **Inputs**:
    - `ver`: The version value to pack, of type `VOFF_TYPE`.
    - `off`: The offset value to pack, of type `VOFF_TYPE`.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Masks the `ver` value to retain only the least significant bits as defined by `VOFF_VER_WIDTH`.
    - Shifts the `off` value left by `VOFF_VER_WIDTH` bits.
    - Combines the masked `ver` and shifted `off` using a bitwise OR operation to produce the packed result.
- **Output**: Returns a `VOFF_TYPE` value that combines the version and offset.
