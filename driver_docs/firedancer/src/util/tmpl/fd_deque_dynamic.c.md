Functions for a single-threaded, fixed-capacity, high-performance double-ended queue (deque) implementation.

# Purpose
The code defines a template for implementing a single-threaded, fixed-capacity double-ended queue (deque) in C. It is designed for high-performance contexts and provides a comprehensive API for managing deques. The code is intended to be included in other C files by defining the `DEQUE_NAME` and `DEQUE_T` macros, which specify the name and element type of the deque, respectively. This inclusion creates a set of functions that operate on the specified deque type, allowing for operations such as pushing and popping elements from both ends, checking the deque's state (e.g., full or empty), and iterating over its elements.

The code provides a variety of functions categorized into constructors, accessors, simple API, and advanced API for zero-copy usage. Constructors handle the creation and deletion of deques, while accessors provide information about the deque's state, such as its maximum capacity and current element count. The simple API includes functions for basic operations like pushing and popping elements, with additional functions for handling full deques by wrapping around. The advanced API offers zero-copy operations for more efficient data handling. The code also includes iterators for traversing the deque from head to tail or in reverse order. The implementation emphasizes performance by avoiding error checking, assuming that the caller ensures the correct usage of the API.

### DEQUE\_<!-- {{#callable:DEQUE_}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/util/tmpl/fd_deque_dynamic.c#L626>)

Accesses an element in a constant deque at a given iterator position.
- **Inputs**:
    - ``deque``: A pointer to a constant deque of type `DEQUE_T`.
    - ``iter``: An iterator of type `DEQUE_(iter_t)` that specifies the position in the deque.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Retrieve the constant header of the deque using `DEQUE_(private_const_hdr_from_deque)` function.
    - Check if handholding is enabled (`FD_TMPL_USE_HANDHOLDING`) and if the iterator is out of bounds, log a critical error using `FD_LOG_CRIT`.
    - Return the element at the position specified by `iter.idx` in the deque.
- **Output**: A pointer to a constant element of type `DEQUE_T` at the specified iterator position in the deque.
- **Functions Called**:
    - [`DEQUE_`](<#deque_>)
