Functions for fast manipulation of large, interprocess-shared index sets with compile-time bounded elements.

# Purpose
The code is a C header file template designed for efficient manipulation of index sets that can be shared between processes. It provides a collection of functions for creating, managing, and manipulating sets with a large, compile-time bounded number of elements. The implementation is optimized for dense sets with a large maximum element count, potentially in the thousands. The template requires the user to define `SET_NAME` and `SET_MAX` before including the file, which allows the creation of a customized set type and associated functions.

The code defines a variety of operations on sets, including constructors and destructors for shared memory, validation functions, and functions to check set properties such as emptiness or fullness. It also provides functions for inserting, removing, and testing elements, as well as set operations like union, intersection, and difference. Additionally, the code includes both destructive and non-destructive iterators for traversing set elements. The template supports range operations for efficient manipulation of contiguous elements within a set. The design ensures that all operations are performed with consideration for memory alignment and footprint, making it suitable for high-performance applications.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `../bits/fd_bits.h`
- `../log/fd_log.h`


# Global Variables

---
### word\_cnt
- **Type**: `enum`
- **Description**: `word_cnt` is an enumerated constant that calculates the number of 64-bit words required to represent a set with a maximum number of elements defined by `SET_MAX`. The calculation uses bitwise operations to determine the number of words needed to store the set efficiently.
- **Use**: Used to define the size of an array for set operations, ensuring it can accommodate the maximum number of elements specified by `SET_MAX`.


# Functions

---
### SET\_<!-- {{#callable:SET_}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/util/tmpl/fd_set.c#L640>)

Counts the number of set bits in a specified range within a set.
- **Inputs**:
    - ``set``: A pointer to a constant `SET_(t)` array representing the set.
    - ``l``: The lower bound of the range (inclusive).
    - ``h``: The upper bound of the range (exclusive).
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - If handholding is enabled, check if the range `[l, h)` is valid; log a critical error if not.
    - Initialize `cnt` to zero to store the count of set bits.
    - Calculate the starting word index `word_idx` by right-shifting `l` by 6.
    - If `l` is not aligned to a word boundary, count the set bits in the first word within the range and update `cnt`.
    - Iterate over complete words between `l` and `h`, adding the count of set bits in each word to `cnt`.
    - For the last word, if `h` is not aligned to a word boundary, count the set bits within the range and update `cnt`.
    - Return the total count of set bits in the range.
- **Output**: The function returns an `ulong` representing the number of set bits in the specified range `[l, h)`.
