Tests the functionality and performance of a giant memory map implementation using randomized operations.

# Purpose
The code is a C program that tests the functionality of a hash map implementation using a custom data structure called `pair_t`. The `pair_t` structure contains fields for a key, a next pointer, a hash value, a value, and a tag. The program includes two external modules, `fd_sort.c` and `fd_map_giant.c`, to provide sorting and map functionalities, respectively. The `fd_sort.c` module is used to sort an array of `pair_t` structures based on their keys, while `fd_map_giant.c` is used to manage the hash map operations such as insertion, deletion, and querying.

The main function initializes a random number generator and sets up test parameters such as the maximum number of elements, seed, and iteration count. It then creates and shuffles arrays of `pair_t` structures, sorts them, and performs various tests on the hash map. These tests include verifying map properties, inserting and removing elements, and checking the integrity of the map through iteration. The program uses logging to report progress and results, and it includes several checks to ensure the map's alignment and memory footprint are within specified limits. The program concludes by cleaning up resources and halting execution.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `../fd_util.h`
- `fd_sort.c`
- `fd_map_giant.c`


# Global Variables

---
### mem
- **Type**: ``uchar[]``
- **Description**: An array of unsigned characters with a size of 32,768 bytes, aligned to a 128-byte boundary. The `__attribute__((aligned(128)))` ensures that the starting address of the array is a multiple of 128, which can be important for performance optimizations on certain hardware architectures.
- **Use**: Used as a memory buffer for operations that require specific alignment and size constraints, such as the `map_new` function in the code.


# Data Structures

---
### pair
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `mykey`: A key of type `ulong` used for sorting and mapping.
    - `mynext`: A `ulong` used to link to the next element in a map or list.
    - `myhash`: A `ulong` used to store the hash value of the key.
    - `val`: A `uint` representing the value associated with the key.
    - `tag`: A `uint` used for tagging or marking purposes.
- **Description**: Defines a `struct` named `pair` that is used to store a key-value pair with additional fields for linking and hashing in a map or list structure. The `mykey` field is the primary key used for sorting and mapping, while `mynext` and `myhash` facilitate linking and hashing operations. The `val` field holds the value associated with the key, and `tag` is used for tagging or marking elements during operations.


---
### pair\_t
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `mykey`: A unique key of type `ulong` for identifying the pair.
    - `mynext`: A `ulong` used for linking to the next element in a data structure.
    - `myhash`: A `ulong` used to store the hash value of the key.
    - `val`: A `uint` representing the value associated with the key.
    - `tag`: A `uint` used for tagging or marking purposes.
- **Description**: Defines a structure `pair_t` that represents a key-value pair with additional fields for linking and hashing, used in data structures like maps and sorting algorithms.


# Functions

---
### shuffle\_pair<!-- {{#callable:shuffle_pair}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/util/tmpl/test_map_giant_mem.c#L26>)

Randomizes the order of elements in an array of `pair_t` structures using the Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm.
- **Inputs**:
    - `rng`: A pointer to a random number generator of type `fd_rng_t` used to generate random indices.
    - `pair`: A pointer to an array of `pair_t` structures that will be shuffled.
    - `cnt`: The number of elements in the `pair` array to shuffle.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Iterates over the array from the second element to the last (index 1 to `cnt-1`).
    - For each element at index `i`, generates a random index `j` such that `0 <= j <= i` using `fd_rng_ulong_roll`.
    - Swaps the elements at indices `i` and `j`.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it modifies the input array `pair` in place.


---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/util/tmpl/test_map_giant_mem.c#L38>)

Initializes and tests a map data structure with randomized key-value pairs, performing insertion, lookup, and deletion operations.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments.
    - `argv`: An array of command-line argument strings.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Calls `fd_boot` to initialize the environment with command-line arguments.
    - Retrieves `max`, `seed`, and `iter_max` values from command-line arguments with default values of 512, 1234, and 1000, respectively.
    - Logs the testing parameters using `FD_LOG_NOTICE`.
    - Initializes a random number generator `rng` using `fd_rng_new` and `fd_rng_join`.
    - Creates two arrays `ref` and `tst` of `pair_t` structures with a maximum size of 512.
    - Checks if `max` exceeds 512 and logs a warning if true, then exits.
    - Populates `ref` and `tst` arrays with unique keys and random values, then sorts `ref` using `sort_pair_inplace`.
    - Checks the alignment and footprint of the map, logging a warning and exiting if they exceed limits.
    - Creates a shared map `shmap` using `map_new` and verifies its properties with `FD_TEST`.
    - Performs a series of random key comparisons and hash operations to test map key functions.
    - Iterates over `iter_max` iterations, shuffling `tst` and performing map operations such as insertion, lookup, and deletion.
    - Logs progress every 100 iterations using `FD_LOG_NOTICE`.
    - Verifies map properties and operations using `FD_TEST` assertions.
    - Leaves and deletes the map, cleaning up resources and logging the test result as 'pass'.
    - Calls `fd_halt` to terminate the program.
- **Output**: Returns 0 to indicate successful execution.
- **Functions Called**:
    - [`shuffle_pair`](<#shuffle_pair>)
