Header-only library for vectors with bounded run-time maximum size, suitable for persistent and IPC usage.

# Purpose
The code is a template for creating vectors with a bounded maximum size, suitable for persistent and inter-process communication (IPC) usage. It is designed for Plain Old Data (POD) types that have a trivial copy operator. The code provides a set of static inline functions that allow the user to define vectors with different types and names by setting the `VEC_NAME` and `VEC_T` macros before including the file. This approach allows the creation of multiple vector types within a single compilation unit, making it flexible for various use cases.

The main functionalities provided by the code include creating a new vector (`VEC_(new)`), joining an existing vector (`VEC_(join)`), leaving a vector (`VEC_(leave)`), and deleting a vector (`VEC_(delete)`). It also includes operations to manage the elements within the vector, such as expanding (`VEC_(expand)`), contracting (`VEC_(contract)`), and removing elements either by index or by compacting (`VEC_(remove_idx)`, `VEC_(remove_compact_idx)`). The code ensures that memory alignment and footprint requirements are met, and it provides utility functions to check the vector's capacity and usage, such as `VEC_(max)`, `VEC_(cnt)`, `VEC_(free)`, `VEC_(is_empty)`, and `VEC_(is_full)`. The design is intended for high-performance computing contexts, where the user is expected to manage memory and element counts carefully.
# Functions

---
### VEC\_<!-- {{#callable:VEC_}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/util/tmpl/fd_vec.c#L241>)

Removes an element from a vector at a specified index by shifting subsequent elements to fill the gap.
- **Inputs**:
    - ``join``: A pointer to the vector from which to remove an element.
    - ``idx``: The index of the element to remove from the vector.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Retrieve the private vector structure using the `VEC_(private)` function.
    - Calculate the new count of elements by decrementing the current count by one.
    - Iterate over the vector starting from the specified index `idx` to the second-to-last element, shifting each element one position to the left.
    - Update the count of elements in the vector to reflect the removal.
    - Return the pointer to the modified vector.
- **Output**: A pointer to the modified vector after the element has been removed and the remaining elements have been compacted.
- **Functions Called**:
    - [`VEC_`](<#vec_>)
