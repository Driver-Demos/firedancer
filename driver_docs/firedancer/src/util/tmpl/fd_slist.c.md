Generates prototypes, inlines, and implementations for high-performance singly linked lists with various operations and memory efficiency features.

# Purpose
The code defines a template for creating singly linked lists (slist) in C, which can store a large number of elements with efficient memory usage. The slist operations are designed to be fast, typically operating in O(1) time, and the memory overhead is minimal. The API is intended to work closely with other data structures like pools, treaps, heaps, maps, and doubly linked lists (dlists). The slist can be used in various contexts, including inter-process communication, memory relocation, and serialization. The code provides a flexible and memory-efficient way to manage lists, with the ability to persist beyond the lifetime of the creating process and support concurrent operations.

The code includes macros and functions to define and manipulate slists, such as `myslist_ele_max`, `myslist_align`, `myslist_footprint`, and `myslist_new`. These functions handle the creation, joining, leaving, and deletion of slists. The code also provides functions for list operations like checking if the list is empty, peeking at the head or tail, pushing and popping elements, and iterating over the list. The template allows for customization by defining macros like `SLIST_NAME` and `SLIST_ELE_T`, which specify the API prefix and element type, respectively. The code supports different implementation styles, allowing it to be used as a local implementation or as part of a library.

### SLIST\_
- **Type**: `ulong`
- **Description**: Represents an iterator type for singly linked lists (slist) in the code. It is used to iterate over elements in the slist.
- **Use**: Used as an iterator to traverse elements in a singly linked list.


# Functions

### SLIST\_<!-- {{#callable:SLIST_}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/util/tmpl/fd_slist.c#L621>)

Validates the integrity of a singly linked list by checking input arguments, iterating through the list to detect cycles, and ensuring the list's head and tail indices are correct.
- **Inputs**:
    - ``join``: A pointer to the singly linked list to verify.
    - ``ele_cnt``: The number of elements in the list, which must be less than or equal to the maximum allowed.
    - ``pool``: A pointer to the element storage pool, which can be NULL if `ele_cnt` is zero.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Define a macro `SLIST_TEST` to check conditions and log a warning if a condition fails, returning -1.
    - Validate the input arguments: `join` must not be NULL, `ele_cnt` must be less than or equal to the maximum element count, and `pool` must be non-NULL if `ele_cnt` is non-zero.
    - Retrieve the private structure of the list using `SLIST_(private_const)` and check if the magic number matches `SLIST_MAGIC`.
    - Initialize `rem` with `ele_cnt`, `prev_idx` with the null index, and `ele_idx` with the index of the list's head.
    - Iterate through the list while `ele_idx` is not null, decrementing `rem` to check for cycles and ensuring `ele_idx` is within bounds.
    - Update `prev_idx` to `ele_idx` and advance `ele_idx` to the next element in the pool.
    - After the loop, verify that the list's tail index matches `prev_idx`.
- **Output**: Returns 0 if the list is valid, or -1 if any validation check fails.
