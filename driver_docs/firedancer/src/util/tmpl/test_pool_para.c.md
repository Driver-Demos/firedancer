Tests for concurrent acquire and release operations on a memory pool with error handling and logging.

# Purpose
The code is a C program that tests a memory pool implementation. It includes a structure definition for `myele`, which represents an element in the pool, and uses macros to configure the pool's parameters. The program includes a main function that initializes the environment, sets up the memory pool, and performs various tests to verify the pool's functionality. These tests include checking the pool's construction, accessors, conversion, initialization, and concurrent acquire/release operations across multiple threads or tiles. The program also tests the pool's destruction and error handling capabilities.

The code uses static memory allocation for shared memory and includes functions for memory alignment and allocation. It employs a random number generator to simulate different operations on the pool, such as acquiring and releasing elements. The program uses assertions and logging to ensure the pool behaves as expected and to report the status of each test. The code is structured to handle multiple threads, using synchronization mechanisms to coordinate concurrent operations. The program concludes by cleaning up resources and logging the results of the tests.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `../fd_util.h`
- `fd_pool_para.c`


# Global Variables

---
### shmem
- **Type**: ``uchar[]``
- **Description**: An array of unsigned characters (`uchar`) with a size defined by `SHMEM_MAX`. It is used to store shared memory data.
- **Use**: Used to allocate memory for shared resources in the program.


---
### shmem\_cnt
- **Type**: ``ulong``
- **Description**: `shmem_cnt` is a static global variable of type `ulong` that tracks the current offset in the shared memory array `shmem`. It is initialized to 0UL.
- **Use**: Used to manage memory allocation within the `shmem` array by updating the offset after each allocation.


---
### tile\_pool
- **Type**: `mypool_t *`
- **Description**: A pointer to a memory pool of type `mypool_t`, which is used to manage a collection of elements of type `myele_t`.
- **Use**: Used to reference the memory pool for acquiring and releasing elements in concurrent operations.


---
### tile\_ele\_max
- **Type**: `ulong`
- **Description**: `tile_ele_max` is a static global variable of type `ulong` that stores the maximum number of elements that can be managed by the pool in the program.
- **Use**: Used to set the maximum number of elements for the pool operations in the `tile_main` function.


---
### tile\_iter\_cnt
- **Type**: `ulong`
- **Description**: `tile_iter_cnt` is a static global variable of type `ulong` that stores the number of iterations to perform in the `tile_main` function.
- **Use**: Used to control the loop iterations in the `tile_main` function for concurrent acquire and release operations.


---
### tile\_go
- **Type**: ``ulong``
- **Description**: A static global variable of type `ulong`.
- **Use**: Controls the start of a loop in the `tile_main` function by acting as a flag.


# Data Structures

---
### myele
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `mynext`: Stores the index of the next element in a pool.
    - `val`: Holds an unsigned integer value associated with the element.
- **Description**: Defines a simple structure with two unsigned integer fields, `mynext` and `val`, used to represent an element in a pool with a reference to the next element and a value.


---
### myele\_t
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - ``mynext``: Stores the index of the next element in the pool.
    - ``val``: Holds a value associated with the element.
- **Description**: Defines a structure with two members: `mynext`, which is used to link elements in a pool, and `val`, which stores a value. This structure is used in conjunction with a pool management system to handle elements in a memory pool.


# Functions

---
### shmem\_alloc<!-- {{#callable:shmem_alloc}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/util/tmpl/test_pool_para.c#L29>)

Allocates a block of memory from a shared memory pool with specified alignment and size.
- **Inputs**:
    - `a`: The alignment requirement for the memory block, specified as an unsigned long integer.
    - `s`: The size of the memory block to allocate, specified as an unsigned long integer.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Aligns the current position in the shared memory (`shmem + shmem_cnt`) to the specified alignment `a` using `fd_ulong_align_up` and assigns it to `m`.
    - Updates `shmem_cnt` to reflect the new position in the shared memory after allocation by adding the size `s` to the aligned position `m` and subtracting the base address of `shmem`.
    - Checks if the updated `shmem_cnt` exceeds the maximum allowed size `SHMEM_MAX` using `FD_TEST`.
    - Returns the aligned memory address `m` cast to a `void *`.
- **Output**: A pointer to the allocated memory block, cast to `void *`.


---
### tile\_main<!-- {{#callable:tile_main}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/util/tmpl/test_pool_para.c#L43>)

Simulates concurrent acquire and release operations on a memory pool across multiple tiles.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments.
    - `argv`: An array of command-line argument strings.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Initialize local variables and join a random number generator with a seed based on the tile index.
    - Allocate shared memory for acquired elements and initialize a sentinel element.
    - Wait for a volatile flag `tile_go` to be set before proceeding with the main loop.
    - Iterate `iter_cnt` times, logging progress every 10,000 iterations if the tile index is zero.
    - Generate a random number to decide whether to acquire or release an element from the pool.
    - If acquiring, attempt to acquire an element from the pool, checking for errors and ensuring uniqueness among acquired elements.
    - If releasing, release a randomly selected acquired element back to the pool, checking for errors.
    - After the loop, release all remaining acquired elements back to the pool.
    - Restore the shared memory counter and delete the random number generator.
- **Output**: Returns 0 to indicate successful execution.
- **Functions Called**:
    - [`shmem_alloc`](<#shmem_alloc>)
