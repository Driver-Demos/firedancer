Header-only template for ultra high performance priority queues with customizable event types and timeouts.

# Purpose
The code defines a template for creating ultra-high-performance priority queues with bounded runtime size in C. It is designed to be included in other C files to generate specific priority queue implementations based on user-defined types and configurations. The code provides a set of static inline functions that operate on these priority queues, allowing for operations such as insertion, removal, and querying of events. The priority queues are implemented as binary heaps, which are efficient for maintaining a dynamically changing set of elements with a priority.

The template allows customization through macros such as `PRQ_NAME` and `PRQ_T`, which define the name and type of the priority queue elements, respectively. The code supports both explicit and implicit timeout fields for prioritizing elements, and it provides mechanisms for low-level optimizations, such as using vector registers for operations. The implementation is designed to be used in performance-critical contexts, and it does not perform input argument checking, requiring careful use by the programmer. The code is structured to be included multiple times in a compilation unit to create different types of priority queues, and it is suitable for use in header files due to its static inline nature.

### PRQ\_<!-- {{#callable:PRQ_}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/util/tmpl/fd_prq.c#L448>)

Removes all events from the priority queue heap by setting the event count to zero.
- **Inputs**:
    - `heap`: A pointer to the priority queue heap from which all events will be removed.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Retrieve the private structure associated with the heap using `PRQ_(private_from_heap)`.
    - Set the `cnt` field of the private structure to zero, effectively removing all events from the heap.
    - Return the original heap pointer.
- **Output**: Returns the original pointer to the heap.
- **Functions Called**:
    - [`PRQ_`](<#prq_>)
