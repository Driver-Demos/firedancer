Functions for a single-threaded, fixed-capacity, high-performance deque using a circular buffer.

# Purpose
The code defines a template for creating a single-threaded, compile-time fixed-capacity double-ended queue (deque) using a circular buffer. This implementation is designed for high-performance contexts and allows for pushing and popping elements from both ends of the deque. The code requires the user to define `DEQUE_NAME`, `DEQUE_T`, and `DEQUE_MAX` before including the file, which customizes the deque's name, element type, and maximum capacity, respectively. The implementation uses a circular buffer to manage the deque's elements, and it is optimized for scenarios where the maximum number of operations is less than \(2^{63}\), especially when `DEQUE_MAX` is a power of two.

The code provides a comprehensive API for deque operations, including constructors, accessors, and both simple and advanced manipulation functions. Constructors handle the creation, joining, and deletion of deques, while accessors provide information about the deque's state, such as its capacity and element count. The simple API includes functions for pushing and popping elements, with additional wrap functions that handle full deques by discarding elements. The advanced API supports zero-copy operations, allowing direct access to elements without copying, and includes functions for inserting and removing elements at both ends. The code also provides iteration functions to traverse the deque from head to tail or in reverse. The implementation does not include error checking for performance reasons, and it assumes that the user will manage conditions such as deque overflow and underflow.

### DEQUE\_<!-- {{#callable:DEQUE_}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/util/tmpl/fd_deque.c#L526>)

Retrieves a constant element from a deque at a specified iterator position.
- **Inputs**:
    - ``deque``: A pointer to a constant `DEQUE_T` deque from which to retrieve the element.
    - ``iter``: An iterator of type `DEQUE_(iter_t)` indicating the position of the element to retrieve.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Retrieve the constant header of the deque using `DEQUE_(private_const_hdr_from_deque)` function.
    - Check if `iter` is out of bounds (less than `hdr->start` or greater than `hdr->end`) if `FD_TMPL_USE_HANDHOLDING` is enabled, and log a critical error if so.
    - Return a pointer to the element at the position calculated by `DEQUE_(private_slot)(iter)` in the deque.
- **Output**: A pointer to a constant `DEQUE_T` element at the specified iterator position in the deque.
- **Functions Called**:
    - [`DEQUE_`](<#deque_>)
