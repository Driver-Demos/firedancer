Prototypes, inlines, and implementations for concurrent persistent shared maps using linear probing and cuckoo hashing techniques.

# Purpose
The code defines a template for generating concurrent persistent shared maps using linear probing with enhancements from cuckoo hashing to improve concurrent performance. It supports multiple concurrent operations with performance comparable to single-threaded maps for non-conflicting operations. The map operations can be serialized, and the map does not require a key sentinel or a guarantee of free elements in the store. The insert, modify, and query operations have a configurable worst-case O(1) cost, while the remove operation's cost is not configurable but remains efficient for reasonable fill ratios.

The code provides a comprehensive API for managing these maps, including functions for creating, joining, and deleting maps, as well as for performing operations like insert, modify, query, and remove. It supports asynchronous execution and can handle non-plain-old-data keys and values. The map can be persisted beyond the lifetime of the creating process, used inter-process, and relocated in memory. The implementation prioritizes massive concurrency, high performance, and efficient cache and file system access patterns. The code is designed to be included in a compilation unit to generate different types of concurrent maps, with options for library header prototypes and implementations.
# Imports and Dependencies

- `fd_map.h`
- `../bits/fd_bits.h`
- `../log/fd_log.h`


# Global Variables

### MAP\_
- **Type**: `MAP_(iter_t)`
- **Description**: Represents an iterator for traversing elements in a map data structure. It holds the state necessary to iterate over elements with the same hash value in the map.
- **Use**: Used to iterate over elements in a map, maintaining the current position and state of the iteration.


# Functions

### MAP\_<!-- {{#callable:MAP_}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/util/tmpl/fd_map_slot_para.c#L2404>)

Maps error codes to human-readable error messages.
- **Inputs**:
    - `err`: An integer representing an error code, which can be one of `FD_MAP_SUCCESS`, `FD_MAP_ERR_INVAL`, `FD_MAP_ERR_AGAIN`, `FD_MAP_ERR_FULL`, or `FD_MAP_ERR_KEY`.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Uses a `switch` statement to match the `err` code to predefined cases.
    - Returns a corresponding string message for each known error code.
    - If the `err` code does not match any predefined case, returns "unknown".
- **Output**: A constant character pointer to a string describing the error.
