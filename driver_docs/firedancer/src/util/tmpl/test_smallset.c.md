Tests for the `fd_smallset` implementation, verifying set operations and properties.

# Purpose
The code is a C program that serves as a test suite for a small set data structure. It includes various operations on sets, such as creation, manipulation, and validation of set properties. The program uses a set of macros and functions defined in the included `fd_smallset.c` file to perform operations like union, intersection, complement, and subset checks on sets. The code tests these operations by creating different types of sets (e.g., null, full, and element-specific sets) and verifying their properties through assertions.

The program begins by initializing a random number generator and defining a maximum set size. It then performs a series of tests to ensure that the set operations behave as expected. These tests include checking the equality of sets, validating set contents, and iterating over set elements. The code also includes conditional compilation directives to handle different environments, such as hosted systems. The main function concludes by cleaning up resources and logging the test results. This program is intended to verify the correctness and reliability of the set operations provided by the `fd_smallset.c` library.

[View Source →](<../../../../../src/util/tmpl/test_smallset.c#L17>)

Initializes the environment, performs a series of set operations and tests, and then cleans up before exiting.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments.
    - `argv`: An array of command-line argument strings.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Calls `fd_boot` to initialize the environment with command-line arguments.
    - Initializes a random number generator `rng`.
    - Sets `max` to the maximum index value using `set_max` and verifies it with `FD_TEST`.
    - Calculates `sum_full` as the sum of all indices from 1 to `max`.
    - Initializes several sets (`null`, `f0`, `f1`, `full`, `n0`, `n1`) and verifies their states using `FD_TEST`.
    - Performs a series of set operations and tests within a loop iterating over indices from 0 to `max`.
    - Tests set operations such as `set_ele`, `set_complement`, `set_union`, `set_intersect`, `set_subtract`, `set_xor`, `set_insert`, `set_remove`, and their conditional variants.
    - Iterates over set elements using `set_iter_t` and verifies sums of indices.
    - Performs range-based set operations and tests their correctness.
    - Optionally tests critical logging behavior if hosted environment is available.
    - Cleans up by deleting the random number generator and halting the environment.
- **Output**: Returns 0 to indicate successful execution.
