Tests for `my_voff` and `my_voff1` version and offset width functionality using static assertions and random values.

# Purpose
The code is an executable C program that tests the functionality of version-offset (voff) operations defined in the included `fd_voff.c` file. It defines two sets of version-offset operations, `my_voff` and `my_voff1`, with different version and offset widths. The program uses static assertions to verify that the version and offset widths are as expected for both `my_voff` and `my_voff1`. The [`main`](<#main>) function initializes a random number generator and performs a series of tests to ensure that the version and offset values are correctly masked and combined into a version-offset structure, and that these values can be accurately retrieved.

The program includes the `fd_util.h` header for utility functions and uses the `fd_rng` functions to generate random numbers for testing. It performs extensive testing by iterating over a large number of random version and offset values, checking that the operations on these values conform to the expected behavior. The tests ensure that the maximum values for version and offset are correctly calculated and that the `my_voff` and `my_voff1` functions behave as intended. The program logs a success message if all tests pass and then halts execution.
# Imports and Dependencies

- `../fd_util.h`
- `fd_voff.c`


# Functions

### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/util/tmpl/test_voff.c#L17>)

Initializes the environment, performs tests on version and offset functions, and logs the results.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments.
    - `argv`: An array of command-line argument strings.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Calls `fd_boot` to initialize the environment with command-line arguments.
    - Creates a random number generator `rng` using `fd_rng_new` and `fd_rng_join`.
    - Performs tests on `my_voff` functions to verify version and offset calculations for 10,000,000 iterations.
    - Performs tests on `my_voff1` functions to verify version and offset calculations for 10,000,000 iterations.
    - Deletes the random number generator using `fd_rng_delete` and `fd_rng_leave`.
    - Logs a notice message indicating the tests passed using `FD_LOG_NOTICE`.
    - Calls `fd_halt` to terminate the program.
- **Output**: Returns 0 to indicate successful execution.
