Tests for the `mypool` memory pool implementation, including construction, operations, and deconstruction.

# Purpose
The code is a C program that tests the functionality of a memory pool implementation. It includes a main function that initializes a random number generator and performs various tests on a memory pool defined by the `mypool` macros. The program checks the construction, special values, conversions, accessors, and operations of the memory pool. It uses a structure `myele_t` to represent elements in the pool, and it tests the pool's ability to acquire and release elements both by index and by element pointer.

The program also includes tests for error handling and logging, particularly in scenarios where incorrect operations are performed on the pool. It uses conditional compilation to include additional tests if certain features are available, such as hosted environments. The code is structured to ensure that the pool behaves correctly under various conditions, including boundary cases and invalid operations. The use of macros and conditional compilation allows for flexibility in testing different configurations of the memory pool.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `../fd_util.h`
- `sys/types.h`
- `sys/wait.h`
- `unistd.h`
- `fd_pool.c`


# Global Variables

---
### acquired\_idx
- **Type**: ``ushort[]``
- **Description**: An array of unsigned short integers with a size defined by `ACQUIRED_MAX`. It stores indices of acquired elements from a pool.
- **Use**: Used to keep track of indices of elements that have been acquired from a pool.


---
### acquired\_cnt
- **Type**: ``ulong``
- **Description**: `acquired_cnt` is a static global variable of type `ulong` initialized to 0. It keeps track of the number of elements currently acquired from a pool.
- **Use**: Used to count the number of elements acquired from the pool, ensuring that operations on the pool do not exceed the number of available elements.


---
### scratch
- **Type**: ``uchar[]``
- **Description**: An array of unsigned characters with a size defined by `SCRATCH_FOOTPRINT`, aligned to `SCRATCH_ALIGN`.
- **Use**: Used as a memory buffer for operations involving the `mypool` data structure.


# Data Structures

---
### myele
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `pool_next`: Stores the index of the next element in the pool.
    - `val`: Holds a value associated with the element.
- **Description**: Defines a structure with two unsigned short integer fields, `pool_next` and `val`, used to manage elements in a pool, where `pool_next` is likely used for linking elements and `val` stores a specific value.


---
### myele\_t
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - ``pool_next``: Stores the index of the next element in the pool.
    - ``val``: Holds a value associated with the element.
- **Description**: Defines a structure with two `ushort` fields, `pool_next` and `val`, used to manage elements in a pool with a linked list-like structure.


# Functions

---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/util/tmpl/test_pool.c#L31>)

Initializes and tests a memory pool system with various operations and configurations.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments.
    - `argv`: An array of command-line argument strings.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Calls `fd_boot` to initialize the environment with command-line arguments.
    - Initializes a random number generator `rng`.
    - Checks pool footprint constraints based on the presence of a sentinel and maximum values.
    - Calculates `scratch_max` and validates it against command-line input `--max`.
    - Logs warnings and exits if `max` exceeds constraints.
    - Tests pool construction by checking alignment and footprint conditions.
    - Creates a new pool `shpool` and joins it to get `pool`.
    - Tests special values and conversions for pool elements and indices.
    - Performs a series of operations (acquire/release) on the pool using random selection.
    - Tests handholding features if hosted environment is available.
    - Tests pool deconstruction by leaving and deleting the pool.
    - Deletes the random number generator and halts the program.
- **Output**: Returns 0 on successful execution or exits early with 0 if constraints are not met.
