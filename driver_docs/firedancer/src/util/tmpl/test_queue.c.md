Tests the functionality of a queue implementation with operations like push, pop, and zero-copy access.

# Purpose
The code is a C program that tests the functionality of a queue implementation. It includes a static buffer and functions [`buf_push`](<#buf_push>) and [`buf_pop`](<#buf_pop>) to manage a simple circular buffer with a maximum size defined by `TEST_QUEUE_MAX`. The program uses these functions to verify the operations of a queue defined in an external file `fd_queue.c`, which is included with specific parameters for queue name, type, and maximum size. The main function initializes a random number generator and performs a series of tests on the queue, including construction, accessor functions, and various queue operations such as push, pop, zero-copy push, and zero-copy pop.

The program uses a scratch memory area for queue operations, ensuring proper alignment and footprint. It performs a large number of iterations to test the queue's behavior under different conditions, including random operations and resets. The tests verify that the queue's state matches the expected state of the static buffer, ensuring the correctness of the queue implementation. The program logs the progress of the tests and concludes by cleaning up resources and halting execution.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `../fd_util.h`
- `fd_queue.c`


# Global Variables

---
### buf
- **Type**: ``int[]``
- **Description**: An array of integers with a size defined by the macro `TEST_QUEUE_MAX`, which is set to 8. This array is used to store integer values in a circular buffer fashion.
- **Use**: Stores integer values for a queue implementation, allowing for push and pop operations.


---
### buf\_start
- **Type**: ``ulong``
- **Description**: `buf_start` is a static global variable of type `ulong` that represents the starting index of the buffer `buf`. It is initialized to 0 and is used to track the position from which elements are removed from the buffer.
- **Use**: Tracks the starting index for buffer operations, specifically for removing elements from the buffer.


---
### buf\_end
- **Type**: ``ulong``
- **Description**: Represents the index in the `buf` array where the next element will be inserted. It is used to track the end of the buffer in a circular queue implementation.
- **Use**: Tracks the position for the next insertion in the circular buffer.


---
### buf\_cnt
- **Type**: ``ulong``
- **Description**: `buf_cnt` is a static global variable of type `ulong` that tracks the number of elements currently in the buffer `buf`. It is initialized to 0 and is used to ensure that the buffer does not exceed its maximum capacity, defined by `TEST_QUEUE_MAX`. The variable is incremented when an element is added to the buffer and decremented when an element is removed.
- **Use**: Tracks the current count of elements in the buffer `buf` to manage buffer operations.


---
### scratch
- **Type**: ``uchar[]``
- **Description**: An array of unsigned characters with a size defined by `SCRATCH_FOOTPRINT`, which is 1024 bytes. The array is aligned in memory according to `SCRATCH_ALIGN`, which is 128 bytes.
- **Use**: Used as a memory buffer for the `test_queue` operations.


# Functions

---
### buf\_push<!-- {{#callable:buf_push}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/util/tmpl/test_queue.c#L10>)

Adds an integer to the end of a circular buffer if it is not full.
- **Inputs**:
    - `i`: The integer to add to the buffer.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Check if the buffer count `buf_cnt` is less than `TEST_QUEUE_MAX` using `FD_TEST` macro.
    - Assign the integer `i` to the buffer at the current end position `buf_end`.
    - Increment the buffer count `buf_cnt` and the end position `buf_end`.
    - If `buf_end` is greater than or equal to `TEST_QUEUE_MAX`, reset `buf_end` to 0.
- **Output**: No return value.


---
### buf\_pop<!-- {{#callable:buf_pop}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/util/tmpl/test_queue.c#L17>)

Removes and returns the first element from a circular buffer.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Checks if the buffer is not empty using `FD_TEST(buf_cnt)`.
    - Retrieves the element at the current `buf_start` index from the `buf` array and stores it in `i`.
    - Decrements the `buf_cnt` to reflect the removal of an element.
    - Increments `buf_start` to point to the next element in the buffer.
    - Checks if `buf_start` has reached `TEST_QUEUE_MAX` and resets it to `0UL` if true, ensuring the circular nature of the buffer.
- **Output**: Returns the integer value of the element removed from the buffer.


---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/util/tmpl/test_queue.c#L32>)

Executes a series of tests on a queue data structure, including construction, accessor, and operation tests, using random operations and a buffer for validation.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments.
    - `argv`: An array of command-line argument strings.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Initializes the system with `fd_boot` and sets up a random number generator `rng`.
    - Logs the start of the construction test and checks the alignment and footprint of the queue.
    - Creates a new queue in the `scratch` memory and joins it, verifying successful creation.
    - Logs the start of the accessor test and verifies the maximum size and initial count of the queue.
    - Logs the start of the operations test and iterates 100,000,000 times, performing random operations on the queue.
    - Randomly selects an operation: push, pop, zero-copy push, or zero-copy pop, and performs it on the queue, updating a buffer for validation.
    - Resets the buffer and queue if a random reset condition is met.
    - Verifies the queue's state after each operation using `FD_TEST` assertions.
    - Leaves and deletes the queue, then deletes the random number generator.
    - Logs a pass message and halts the system with `fd_halt`.
- **Output**: Returns 0 to indicate successful execution.
- **Functions Called**:
    - [`buf_push`](<#buf_push>)
    - [`buf_pop`](<#buf_pop>)
