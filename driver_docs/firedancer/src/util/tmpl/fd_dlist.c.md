Generates prototypes, inlines, and implementations for high-performance computing doubly linked lists.

# Purpose
The code defines a template for creating and managing doubly linked lists (dlists) in C. It provides a set of macros and functions that allow users to define their own dlist types by specifying the element type and the list name. The code supports operations such as adding, removing, and accessing elements at both the head and tail of the list, as well as inserting and removing elements at arbitrary positions. It also includes functions for iterating over the list in both forward and reverse order. The dlist is designed to be memory efficient and can be used in various contexts, including inter-process communication and persistent storage.

The code is structured to allow for different implementation styles, including local use, library header declarations, and library implementations. It uses macros to define the API prefix and element type, and it provides default implementations for certain types and fields if they are not specified by the user. The code also includes functions for creating, joining, leaving, and deleting dlists, as well as verifying the integrity of a dlist. The design prioritizes memory efficiency and flexibility, allowing dlists to be used in a wide range of applications.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `../log/fd_log.h`


# Global Variables

---
### DLIST\_
- **Type**: `typedef ulong`
- **Description**: Represents an iterator type for a doubly linked list (dlist) in the code. It is used to iterate over elements in the dlist, either in forward or reverse order.
- **Use**: Used as an iterator to traverse elements in a doubly linked list.


# Functions

---
### DLIST\_<!-- {{#callable:DLIST_}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/util/tmpl/fd_dlist.c#L770>)

Validates the integrity of a doubly linked list by checking input arguments, list structure, and element links.
- **Inputs**:
    - ``join``: A pointer to the doubly linked list structure to verify.
    - ``ele_cnt``: The number of elements in the list, which must not exceed the maximum allowed.
    - ``pool``: A pointer to the array of list elements, used to verify element links.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Define a macro `DLIST_TEST` to check conditions and log warnings if they fail.
    - Validate input arguments: `join` must not be NULL, `ele_cnt` must not exceed the maximum, and `pool` must be valid if `ele_cnt` is non-zero.
    - Retrieve the private structure of the list and check its magic number for validity.
    - Initialize variables for remaining elements, previous index, and current element index.
    - Iterate through the list from head to tail, checking for cycles, valid indices, and reverse link integrity.
    - After iteration, verify that the tail of the list matches the last visited element index.
    - Return 0 if all checks pass, otherwise return -1 if any check fails.
- **Output**: Returns 0 if the list is valid, or -1 if any validation check fails.
- **Functions Called**:
    - [`DLIST_IDX_T::DLIST_`](<#dlist_idx_tdlist_>)
