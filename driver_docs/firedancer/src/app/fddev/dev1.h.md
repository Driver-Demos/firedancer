Defines an external action `fd_action_dev1` with configuration inclusion.

# Purpose
This code is a C header file that provides an interface for a specific device-related action. It includes a shared configuration header file, `fd_config.h`, which likely contains common configuration settings or definitions used across multiple files. The header file declares an external variable, `fd_action_dev1`, of type `action_t`, which suggests that it represents a specific action or operation related to the device. The use of include guards, `HEADER_fd_src_app_fddev_dev1_h`, prevents multiple inclusions of this header file, ensuring that the declarations within are only processed once during compilation.
