Defines constants, callback arrays, configuration stages, tile functions, and actions for the fddev application.

# Purpose
This C++ header file defines and organizes a set of external variables and arrays that are used to manage callbacks, configuration stages, tiles, and actions for an application named "Frankendancer" with the binary name "fddev". The file includes a header for configuration commands and declares several arrays, such as `CALLBACKS`, `STAGES`, `TILES`, and `ACTIONS`, which group related external variables. These arrays end with a `NULL` pointer to indicate the end of the list. The file provides narrow functionality as it primarily serves as a declaration and organization point for these external variables, which are likely defined and used elsewhere in the application.
