Makefile for building and running the `fddev` application with integration tests and conditional dependencies.

# Purpose
The `Makefile` content defines build and execution rules for a software project. It uses conditional directives to check for specific features such as `FD_HAS_HOSTED`, `FD_HAS_LINUX`, `FD_HAS_ALLOCA`, `FD_HAS_DOUBLE`, and `FD_HAS_INT128`, ensuring that the build process only proceeds if these conditions are met. The `.PHONY` targets `fddev`, `run`, and `monitor` are declared to prevent conflicts with files of the same name. The `add-objs` function is called to add object files for various components, and the `make-bin-rust` function is used to compile a binary named `fddev` with specified dependencies. The `run` and `monitor` targets are defined to execute the `fddev` binary with optional arguments, and integration tests are set up and executed using `make-integration-test` and `run-integration-test` functions.
