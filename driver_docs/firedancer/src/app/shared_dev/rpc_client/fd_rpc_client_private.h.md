Defines private data structures for managing RPC client requests and responses in the Firedancer codebase.

# Purpose
This code is a C header file that defines private data structures for an RPC (Remote Procedure Call) client. It includes the `fd_rpc_client.h` header and the `<poll.h>` library to manage file descriptor polling. The `fd_rpc_client_request` structure holds the state of an RPC request, including buffers for request and response data. It uses a union to manage different states of a request, such as when it is connected or when a response is sent. The `fd_rpc_client_private` structure, aligned according to `FD_RPC_CLIENT_ALIGN`, contains an array of `pollfd` structures for monitoring multiple file descriptors and an array of `fd_rpc_client_request` structures to handle multiple concurrent RPC requests.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `fd_rpc_client.h`
- `poll.h`


# Data Structures

---
### fd\_rpc\_client\_request
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `state`: Stores the current state of the RPC client request.
    - `response_bytes`: Holds the response data shared across multiple states.
    - `connected`: Contains fields related to the connected state, including request byte count, bytes sent, and request data.
    - `sent`: Contains fields related to the sent state, including the number of response bytes read.
    - `response`: Holds the response data in the form of `fd_rpc_client_response_t`.
- **Description**: Manages the state and data of an RPC client request, including request and response data, and handles different states such as connected and sent.


---
### fd\_rpc\_client\_private
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `request_id`: Stores a unique identifier for each request.
    - `rpc_addr`: Holds the address of the RPC server.
    - `rpc_port`: Specifies the port number of the RPC server.
    - `fds`: An array of `pollfd` structures for monitoring multiple file descriptors.
    - `requests`: An array of `fd_rpc_client_request` structures to manage multiple RPC requests.
- **Description**: Aligns to `FD_RPC_CLIENT_ALIGN` and manages RPC client operations, including request tracking, server address and port, and file descriptor polling.
