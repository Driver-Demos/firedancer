Defines an external action for packet generation.

# Purpose
This code is a C header file that defines an interface for packet generation functionality. It includes a configuration header file, `fd_config.h`, which is located in a relative path. The header file declares an external variable, `fd_action_pktgen`, of type `action_t`, which is likely used to represent a specific action or command related to packet generation. The header guard prevents multiple inclusions of this file, ensuring that the declarations are only processed once during compilation.
# Imports and Dependencies
