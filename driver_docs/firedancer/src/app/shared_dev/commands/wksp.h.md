Header file for workspace command functions and an external action in the Firedancer codebase.

# Purpose
This code is a C header file that declares functions and an external variable related to workspace commands. It includes the necessary configuration header file `fd_config.h` and defines the function prototypes [`wksp_cmd_perm`](<#wksp_cmd_perm>) and [`wksp_cmd_fn`](<#wksp_cmd_fn>), which are used to perform operations with workspace command arguments and configurations. The `FD_PROTOTYPES_BEGIN` and `FD_PROTOTYPES_END` macros likely manage the scope or linkage of these prototypes. Additionally, the file declares an external variable `fd_action_wksp` of type `action_t`, which is probably used to represent an action related to workspace operations. The header guard prevents multiple inclusions of this file.
