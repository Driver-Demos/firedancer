Header file for declaring the external action `fd_action_flame`.

# Purpose
This code is a C header file that defines an interface for a specific action related to "flame" within a larger application. It includes a configuration header file, `fd_config.h`, which is located in a shared directory, indicating that it may rely on shared configuration settings or definitions. The header file declares an external variable, `fd_action_flame`, of type `action_t`, which suggests that it is used to represent or execute a specific action or command related to "flame" in the application. The use of include guards, `#ifndef` and `#define`, ensures that the contents of this header file are only included once during compilation to prevent redefinition errors.
# Imports and Dependencies

- **Description**: Declares an external variable of type `action_t` named `fd_action_flame`. This variable is likely used to represent or manage a specific action related to a 'flame' command in the application.
