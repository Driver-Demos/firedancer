Header file defining an external transaction action `fd_action_txn`.

# Purpose
This code is a C header file that defines an interface for transaction-related actions within a software application. It includes a configuration header file, `fd_config.h`, which is located in a shared directory, indicating that it may contain common configuration settings or definitions used across multiple components. The header file declares an external variable, `fd_action_txn`, of type `action_t`, which suggests that it represents a specific action or command related to transactions. The use of include guards, `HEADER_fd_src_app_shared_dev_commands_txn_h`, prevents multiple inclusions of this header file, ensuring that the declarations within it are only processed once by the compiler.
