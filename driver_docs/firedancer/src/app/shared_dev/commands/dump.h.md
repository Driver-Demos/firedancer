Header file for defining the external action `fd_action_dump`.

# Purpose
This code is a C header file that defines an interface for a specific action related to dumping operations. It includes a configuration header file, `fd_config.h`, which is located in a shared directory, indicating that it might use or depend on shared configuration settings. The header file declares an external variable, `fd_action_dump`, of type `action_t`, which suggests that it is used to represent or trigger a dumping action within the application. The use of include guards, `HEADER_fd_src_app_shared_dev_commands_dump_h`, prevents multiple inclusions of this header file, ensuring that the declarations are only processed once during compilation.
