Header file for declaring the external action `fd_action_load`.

# Purpose
This is a C header file that defines an interface for a specific action related to loading functionality. It includes a configuration header file, `fd_config.h`, which is located in a shared directory. The header file declares an external variable, `fd_action_load`, of type `action_t`, which is likely used to represent or execute a load action within the application. The use of include guards, `HEADER_fd_src_app_shared_dev_commands_load_h`, prevents multiple inclusions of this header file, ensuring that the declarations are only processed once during compilation.
