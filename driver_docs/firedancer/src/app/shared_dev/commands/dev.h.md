Header file for command functions related to argument parsing, permission checking, and execution.

# Purpose
This C header file declares function prototypes for device command operations within an application. It includes necessary dependencies from `fd_config.h` and `fd_action.h`, which are likely to provide configuration structures and action-related functionalities. The file defines three functions: [`dev_cmd_args`](<#dev_cmd_args>), [`dev_cmd_perm`](<#dev_cmd_perm>), and [`dev_cmd_fn`](<#dev_cmd_fn>). The [`dev_cmd_args`](<#dev_cmd_args>) function is responsible for handling command-line arguments, taking pointers to argument count and argument vector, as well as an `args_t` structure. The [`dev_cmd_perm`](<#dev_cmd_perm>) function manages permission checks using an `args_t` structure, a capability check structure `fd_cap_chk_t`, and a constant configuration structure `config_t`. The [`dev_cmd_fn`](<#dev_cmd_fn>) function executes a device command using an `args_t` structure, a `config_t` structure, and a function pointer `agave_main` for further processing. The file uses include guards to prevent multiple inclusions.

### dev\_cmd\_args<!-- {{#callable_declaration:dev_cmd_args}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../../src/app/shared_dev/commands/dev.h#L7>)

Parses command-line arguments and updates the `args` structure.
- **Description**: Use this function to process command-line arguments and update the `args` structure with specific flags and options. This function modifies the `args` structure based on the presence of certain command-line flags such as `--monitor`, `--no-configure`, `--no-init-workspaces`, `--no-agave`, and `--no-solana`. It also handles the `--debug-tile` option, copying its value into the `args` structure if present. Call this function after initializing the `args` structure and before using it in other operations. Ensure that `pargc` and `pargv` correctly represent the command-line arguments.
- **Inputs**:
    - `pargc`: Pointer to the argument count. Must not be null. Represents the number of command-line arguments.
    - `pargv`: Pointer to the argument vector. Must not be null. Represents the array of command-line argument strings.
    - `args`: Pointer to an `args_t` structure. Must not be null. The function updates this structure based on the command-line arguments.
- **Output**: None
- **See Also**: [`dev_cmd_args`](<dev.c.md#dev_cmd_args>)  (Implementation)

### dev\_cmd\_perm<!-- {{#callable_declaration:dev_cmd_perm}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../../src/app/shared_dev/commands/dev.h#L14>)

Executes device command permissions based on configuration.
- **Description**: Use this function to execute device command permissions, which may include configuration steps, based on the provided arguments and configuration. It is important to ensure that the `args` parameter is correctly initialized and that the `chk` and `config` parameters are valid and non-null. This function will perform configuration commands unless the `no_configure` flag in `args->dev` is set. After any necessary configuration, it will execute the command permissions.
- **Inputs**:
    - `args`: A pointer to an `args_t` structure that contains command arguments. The `dev.no_configure` flag within this structure determines if configuration commands are skipped. Must not be null.
    - `chk`: A pointer to an `fd_cap_chk_t` structure used for capability checking. Must not be null.
    - `config`: A pointer to a constant `config_t` structure that provides configuration data. Must not be null.
- **Output**: None
- **See Also**: [`dev_cmd_perm`](<dev.c.md#dev_cmd_perm>)  (Implementation)

### dev\_cmd\_fn<!-- {{#callable_declaration:dev_cmd_fn}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../../src/app/shared_dev/commands/dev.h#L19>)

Executes a development command with specified configurations and main function.
- **Description**: Use this function to execute a development command with the given arguments and configuration. It manages configuration updates, handles debugging options, and executes the main function in different modes based on the provided arguments. This function must be called with valid `args` and `config` structures, and a valid `agave_main` function pointer. It may fork processes and handle signals, so it should be used in environments where such operations are safe and expected.
- **Inputs**:
    - `args`: A pointer to an `args_t` structure containing command arguments. Must not be null. The function uses this to determine configuration and execution behavior.
    - `config`: A pointer to a `config_t` structure that holds configuration settings. Must not be null. The function updates this configuration based on the command arguments.
    - `agave_main`: A function pointer to a function that takes a constant `config_t` pointer as an argument. This function is called as part of the execution process. Must not be null.
- **Output**: None
- **See Also**: [`dev_cmd_fn`](<dev.c.md#dev_cmd_fn>)  (Implementation)
