Function prototypes for benchmarking commands and topology configuration in the Firedancer application.

# Purpose
This C header file defines function prototypes for benchmarking commands within a software application. It includes necessary dependencies from `fd_config.h` and `fd_action.h` to configure and execute these commands. The function [`bench_cmd_fn`](<#bench_cmd_fn>) is designed to execute a benchmark command using the provided arguments and configuration. The function [`bench_cmd_args`](<#bench_cmd_args>) is responsible for parsing and setting up command-line arguments for the benchmark. Additionally, the [`add_bench_topo`](<#add_bench_topo>) function is declared to configure a benchmarking topology with various parameters such as tile counts, transaction mode, and network settings. The file uses include guards to prevent multiple inclusions.

# Function Declarations (Public API)

### bench\_cmd\_fn<!-- {{#callable_declaration:bench_cmd_fn}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../../../src/app/shared_dev/commands/bench/bench.h#L7>)

Configures and initializes the benchmarking environment.
- **Description**: Use this function to set up the necessary configuration and initialize the environment for benchmarking. It adjusts configuration settings based on the provided arguments and ensures that CPU affinity settings are consistent. It also prepares the network namespace and installs XDP if required. This function must be called with valid configuration and argument structures, and it assumes that the configuration file has been properly set up. It logs an error if CPU affinity settings are inconsistent across different configuration sections.
- **Inputs**:
    - `args`: A pointer to an `args_t` structure containing command-line arguments. Must not be null.
    - `config`: A pointer to a `config_t` structure containing configuration settings. Must not be null and should be properly initialized before calling this function.
- **Output**: None
- **See Also**: [`bench_cmd_fn`](<bench.c.md#bench_cmd_fn>)  (Implementation)

### bench\_cmd\_args<!-- {{#callable_declaration:bench_cmd_args}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../../../src/app/shared_dev/commands/bench/bench.h#L10>)

Parses command-line arguments to configure benchmark settings.
- **Description**: Use this function to parse command-line arguments and update the benchmark settings in the `args` structure. It checks for the presence of the `--no-quic` flag in the command-line arguments and updates the `no_quic` field in the `args` structure accordingly. This function must be called with valid pointers to the argument count and argument vector, as well as a valid `args` structure. Ensure that the command-line arguments are correctly formatted and that the pointers provided are not null.
- **Inputs**:
    - `pargc`: Pointer to the argument count. Must not be null. The function uses this to access and modify the number of command-line arguments.
    - `pargv`: Pointer to the argument vector. Must not be null. The function uses this to access and modify the list of command-line arguments.
    - `args`: Pointer to an `args_t` structure where the parsed command-line options will be stored. Must not be null. The function updates the `no_quic` field based on the presence of the `--no-quic` flag.
- **Output**: None
- **See Also**: [`bench_cmd_args`](<bench.c.md#bench_cmd_args>)  (Implementation)
