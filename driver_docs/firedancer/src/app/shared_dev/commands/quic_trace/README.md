Header and source files for QUIC tracing, parsing, logging, and passive decryption in Firedancer.


## Files
- **[fd_quic_trace.h](fd_quic_trace.h.md)**: Header file for QUIC tracing, defining data structures, macros, and functions for tracing QUIC connections.
- **[fd_quic_trace_frame.c](fd_quic_trace_frame.c.md)**: Implements functions for tracing and parsing QUIC frames in a network context.
- **[fd_quic_trace_log_tile.c](fd_quic_trace_log_tile.c.md)**: Processes QUIC trace logs by defining callback functions for handling fragments and logging connection close events.
- **[fd_quic_trace_main.c](fd_quic_trace_main.c.md)**: Glue code for the 'fddev quic-trace' subcommand to tap QUIC traffic by joining remote target tile objects.
- **[fd_quic_trace_rx_tile.c](fd_quic_trace_rx_tile.c.md)**: Passive decryption of incoming QUIC packets with a mock setup and run loop for fd_quic_tile.
- **[Local.mk](Local.mk.md)**: Makefile for adding QUIC trace-related objects if `FD_HAS_ALLOCA` is defined.
