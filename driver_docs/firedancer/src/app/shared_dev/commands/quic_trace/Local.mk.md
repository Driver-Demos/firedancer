Makefile for adding QUIC trace-related objects if `FD_HAS_ALLOCA` is defined.

# Purpose
This Makefile snippet conditionally adds object files to the build process if the `FD_HAS_ALLOCA` macro is defined. The `add-objs` function is called to include `fd_quic_trace_frame`, `fd_quic_trace_main`, `fd_quic_trace_rx_tile`, and `fd_quic_trace_log_tile` into the `fddev_shared` target. This setup is used to manage the compilation of specific components based on the presence of the `FD_HAS_ALLOCA` feature.
