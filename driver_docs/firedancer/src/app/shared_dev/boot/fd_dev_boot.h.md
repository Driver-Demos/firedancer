Declares the `fd_dev_main` function for initializing Firedancer device configurations.

# Purpose
This code is a C header file that declares the function prototype for [`fd_dev_main`](<#fd_dev_main>). The function [`fd_dev_main`](<#fd_dev_main>) is designed to be the main entry point for a device-related application, taking parameters such as `argc`, `_argv`, a flag `is_firedancer`, an array of configuration files `configs`, and a function pointer `topo_init` for initializing a topology with a given configuration. The header file includes two other headers, `fd_config.h` and `fd_config_file.h`, which likely define configuration structures and functions used by [`fd_dev_main`](<#fd_dev_main>). The file uses include guards to prevent multiple inclusions and is wrapped with `FD_PROTOTYPES_BEGIN` and `FD_PROTOTYPES_END` macros, which may be used for conditional compilation or other preprocessing tasks.

[View Source →](<../../../../../../src/app/shared_dev/boot/fd_dev_boot.h#L7>)

Executes a command based on command-line arguments and configuration.
- **Description**: Use this function to execute a command in a development or test environment based on the provided command-line arguments and configuration settings. It processes command-line arguments to determine the action to perform, checks permissions, and executes the corresponding function. This function must be called with valid command-line arguments and configuration pointers. It is intended for use in environments where Firedancer is applicable. Ensure that the configuration does not target a live cluster unless the action is diagnostic.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments. Must be a non-negative integer. If the value is too large, an error is logged.
    - `_argv`: An array of command-line argument strings. Must not be null and should contain at least 'argc' elements.
    - `is_firedancer`: An integer flag indicating if the environment is Firedancer. Non-zero for true, zero for false.
    - `configs`: A pointer to an array of configuration file pointers. Must not be null. The caller retains ownership.
    - `topo_init`: A pointer to a function that initializes the topology with a given configuration. Must not be null.
- **Output**: Returns 0 on successful execution of the command. Logs errors and may terminate the process if issues occur.
