Makefile for building and configuring shared development components in the Firedancer project.

# Purpose
This Makefile script is used to manage the build process for a software project that includes various components and commands. It checks for the presence of specific conditions, such as `FD_HAS_HOSTED` and `FD_HAS_LINUX`, to determine if the build should proceed. The script uses the `make-lib` function to create a shared library named `fddev_shared`. It then adds multiple object files to this library, categorized into different sections such as boot, actions, tiles, and configure stages. Each section includes specific commands or modules, like `bench`, `bundle_client`, `dev`, and others, which are added to the `fddev_shared` library. Additionally, the script includes a conditional section for `FD_HAS_INT128`, which adds the `genesis` command if the condition is met.
