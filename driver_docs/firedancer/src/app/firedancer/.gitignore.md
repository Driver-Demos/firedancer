Specifies files to ignore in version control, including `version.h` and `version2.h`.

# Purpose
The content specifies a list of header files, `version.h` and `version2.h`. These files are likely used in a software project to define version-related information or constants. Including these headers in the build process allows the software to access version data, which can be used for display, logging, or conditional compilation based on version checks.
