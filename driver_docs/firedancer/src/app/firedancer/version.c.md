Defines version and commit reference constants for the Firedancer application.

# Purpose
This code is a C source file that defines versioning information for the Firedancer software. It includes header files `fd_util.h` and `version.h` and sets default values for the patch version and commit reference if they are not already defined. The file declares constants for the major, minor, and patch version numbers, as well as the commit reference in both integer and string formats. Additionally, it constructs version strings for both Firedancer and `fdctl` using macros to convert version numbers into string format. This information is useful for tracking software versions and ensuring compatibility across different components of the software.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `../../util/fd_util.h`
- `version.h`


# Global Variables

---
### firedancer\_major\_version
- **Type**: `ulong`
- **Description**: Represents the major version number of the Firedancer software.
- **Use**: Used to identify the major version of the software in versioning operations.


---
### firedancer\_minor\_version
- **Type**: ``ulong``
- **Description**: A constant unsigned long integer that holds the minor version number of the Firedancer software. The value is defined by the preprocessor macro `FIREDANCER_MINOR_VERSION`.
- **Use**: Used to represent the minor version component of the Firedancer software versioning scheme.


---
### firedancer\_patch\_version
- **Type**: `ulong`
- **Description**: Represents the patch version number of the Firedancer software. It is a constant value defined by the macro `FIREDANCER_PATCH_VERSION`, which defaults to 9999 if not otherwise specified.
- **Use**: Used to store the patch version number of the Firedancer software as a constant.


---
### firedancer\_commit\_ref
- **Type**: ``uint``
- **Description**: A constant unsigned integer that stores the commit reference of the Firedancer project in a 32-bit format. It is defined using the macro `FIREDANCER_COMMIT_REF_U32`, which defaults to `0x0` if not specified.
- **Use**: Used to store and reference the specific commit version of the Firedancer project in a numeric format.


---
### firedancer\_commit\_ref\_string
- **Type**: ``char const[]``
- **Description**: Stores the commit reference as a string for the Firedancer project. The value is defined by the macro `FIREDANCER_COMMIT_REF_CSTR`, which defaults to a 40-character string of zeros if not otherwise defined.
- **Use**: Used to provide a string representation of the commit reference for version tracking or display purposes.


---
### firedancer\_version\_string
- **Type**: ``char const[]``
- **Description**: A constant character array that stores the version string of the Firedancer software. The version string is constructed by concatenating the major, minor, and patch version numbers, each converted to a string using the `FD_EXPAND_THEN_STRINGIFY` macro.
- **Use**: Used to represent the version of the Firedancer software as a string.


---
### fdctl\_commit\_ref\_string
- **Type**: ``char const[]``
- **Description**: A constant character array that stores the commit reference string for the `fdctl` component. It is initialized with the value of the macro `FIREDANCER_COMMIT_REF_CSTR`, which defaults to a string of 40 zeros if not defined elsewhere.
- **Use**: Used to store and provide the commit reference string for the `fdctl` component.


---
### fdctl\_version\_string
- **Type**: ``char const[]``
- **Description**: A constant character array that stores the version string of the `fdctl` component. The version string is constructed by concatenating the major, minor, and patch version numbers of the Firdancer software, separated by periods.
- **Use**: Used to represent the version of the `fdctl` component in a human-readable format.
