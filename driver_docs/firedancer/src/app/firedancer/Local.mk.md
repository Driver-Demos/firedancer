Makefile for managing versioning and build configurations in the Firedancer application.

# Purpose
The provided content is a Makefile used to automate the build process for the Firedancer software. It includes directives to generate a version header file, `version2.h`, by defining version-related macros such as `FIREDANCER_MAJOR_VERSION`, `FIREDANCER_MINOR_VERSION`, and `FIREDANCER_PATCH_VERSION`. The file also checks if the existing `version.h` file needs updating by comparing it with `version2.h` and copying it if changes are detected. Additionally, the Makefile specifies dependencies for object files related to different network configurations and includes conditional compilation based on the presence of certain features like threading, alloca, and specific libraries. The Makefile also defines targets for building the Firedancer core and its associated commands, ensuring that the necessary libraries and binaries are compiled if the required conditions are met.
