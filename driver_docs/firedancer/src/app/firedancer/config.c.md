Imports binary configuration files for different network environments in the Firedancer application.

# Purpose
This code is a C source file that imports binary configuration files for different network environments using the `FD_IMPORT_BINARY` macro. The file includes configurations for `firedancer_default_config`, `firedancer_testnet_config`, `firedancer_devnet_config`, and `firedancer_mainnet_config`. Each configuration is associated with a specific TOML file located in the `src/app/firedancer/config` directory. The inclusion of `fd_util_base.h` suggests that the file relies on utility functions or macros defined in that header. This setup is likely used to manage and access different configuration settings for various deployment environments in a Firedancer application.
