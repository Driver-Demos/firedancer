Configuration file for Solana devnet with gossip entrypoints and expected genesis hash.

# Purpose
The configuration file specifies network and consensus settings for a Solana node. Under the `gossip` section, it defines a list of entry points with their respective addresses and ports for connecting to the Solana Devnet. The `consensus` section sets the `expected_genesis_hash`, which is a hash value that the node uses to verify the genesis block of the blockchain.
