Configuration for mainnet with gossip entrypoints, consensus hash, and funk settings.

# Purpose
The configuration file defines settings for a Solana network node. Under the `gossip` section, it specifies a list of entry points for the node to connect to the Solana mainnet-beta network, using specified hostnames and port `8001`. The `consensus` section sets the `expected_genesis_hash`, which is a unique identifier for the blockchain's genesis block, ensuring the node connects to the correct network. The `funk` section configures the node's resource usage, setting the `heap_size_gib` to 600 GiB and limiting `max_account_records` to 1,100,000,000, which controls memory allocation and the maximum number of account records the node can handle.
