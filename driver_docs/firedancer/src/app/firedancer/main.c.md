Defines the main function for the Firedancer application, including configuration, callbacks, tiles, and actions.

# Purpose
The code is a C source file that serves as an entry point for a program named "Firedancer." It includes several header files, which suggests that it relies on external definitions and configurations. The file defines several arrays of pointers to structures and functions, which are used to manage different components and actions within the program. These arrays include `CALLBACKS`, `STAGES`, `TILES`, and `ACTIONS`, each containing pointers to various callback functions, configuration stages, operational tiles, and actions, respectively. The [`main`](<#main>) function initializes configuration files for different network environments (default, testnet, devnet, and mainnet) and calls `fd_main` to start the program with these configurations.

The file also contains a function [`add_bench_topo`](<#add_bench_topo>), which appears to be a placeholder or utility function for adding a benchmark topology. This function takes several parameters related to network topology and performance metrics, but it does not perform any operations with them, as indicated by the use of `(void)` casts to suppress unused variable warnings. This suggests that the function is either a stub for future development or used conditionally in specific builds. The presence of this function indicates that the program may have capabilities for performance testing or monitoring in certain configurations.
