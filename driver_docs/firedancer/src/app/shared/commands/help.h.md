Header file for the help command function and related action in the Firedancer application.

# Purpose
This code is a C header file that declares a function and an external variable related to a help command in an application. The function [`help_cmd_fn`](<#help_cmd_fn>) takes pointers to `args_t` and `config_t` structures as parameters, which suggests it processes command-line arguments and configuration data. The `fd_action_help` is declared as an external variable of type `action_t`, indicating it is defined elsewhere and is likely used to represent the help action within the application. The file uses include guards to prevent multiple inclusions and includes a configuration header file `fd_config.h`. The `FD_PROTOTYPES_BEGIN` and `FD_PROTOTYPES_END` macros are used to encapsulate the function prototype, which may be part of a larger framework or convention in the codebase.
