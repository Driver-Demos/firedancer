Defines a command to print workspace memory and tile topology information.

# Purpose
This code defines a function `mem_cmd_fn` and an `action_t` structure `fd_action_mem` for a memory-related action in a software system. The function `mem_cmd_fn` takes two parameters, `args` and `config`, and calls `fd_topo_print_log` to print memory and tile topology information from the `config` parameter. The `fd_action_mem` structure specifies the action's name as "mem", associates it with the `mem_cmd_fn` function, and includes a description of the action's purpose. The `require_config` field is set to 1, indicating that a configuration is necessary for this action. The code includes headers `fd_config.h` and `fd_action.h`, which likely define the types and functions used in this file.

### mem\_cmd\_fn
- **Type**: `function`
- **Description**: Executes a command to print memory and tile topology information using the `fd_topo_print_log` function.
- **Use**: Used as a function pointer in the `fd_action_mem` structure to perform memory and topology logging.


---
### fd\_action\_mem
- **Type**: ``action_t``
- **Description**: Defines an action structure for the 'mem' command, which includes a function pointer to `mem_cmd_fn` and a description of its purpose.
- **Use**: Used to store and manage the properties and behavior of the 'mem' action in the application.
