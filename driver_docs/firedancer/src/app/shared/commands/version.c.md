Defines a command to display the current software version and commit reference.

# Purpose
This code defines a command action for a software application, specifically to display the current version of the software. It includes necessary headers and declares two external string variables, `fdctl_version_string` and `fdctl_commit_ref_string`, which store the version and commit reference of the software. The function `version_cmd_fn` is implemented to output these version details to the standard output. An `action_t` structure, `fd_action_version`, is initialized to represent this version command, with properties such as `name`, `fn`, and `description` set to define the command's behavior and purpose. The `is_immediate` field is set to 1, indicating that the action should execute immediately.
