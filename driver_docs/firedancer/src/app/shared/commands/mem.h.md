Header file for memory command function and action in the Firedancer application.

# Purpose
This C header file defines the interface for memory-related command functionality within an application. It includes a function prototype for [`mem_cmd_fn`](<#mem_cmd_fn>), which takes pointers to `args_t` and `config_t` structures as parameters, indicating that it processes command arguments and configuration data. The file also declares an external variable `fd_action_mem` of type `action_t`, which suggests it is used to represent or execute a specific memory-related action. The inclusion of `fd_config.h` implies that the file relies on configuration settings defined elsewhere. The use of include guards prevents multiple inclusions of this header file, ensuring that the declarations are only processed once during compilation.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `../fd_config.h`


# Global Variables

---

- **Type**: ``action_t``
- **Description**: `fd_action_mem` is a global variable of type `action_t`. It is declared as an external variable, indicating that its definition is in another source file.
- **Use**: Used to reference an `action_t` instance across multiple source files.
