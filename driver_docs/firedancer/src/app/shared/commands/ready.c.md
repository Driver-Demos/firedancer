Function to wait for all tiles to be ready and log their status in a distributed system.

# Purpose
The code defines a function `ready_cmd_fn` that is part of a larger system for managing and monitoring a set of computational tiles. The function is responsible for ensuring that all tiles in a given configuration are ready to operate. It does this by checking the status of each tile and waiting until they are in a ready state. The function uses the `fd_topo_find_wksp`, `fd_topo_join_workspace`, and `fd_topo_workspace_fill` functions to interact with a shared memory workspace, which is identified by the name "metric_in". The function also logs messages to indicate the readiness of the tiles and any issues encountered during the process.

The code also defines an `action_t` structure named `fd_action_ready`, which associates the `ready_cmd_fn` function with the action name "ready". This structure includes metadata such as the action's name, a description, and a flag indicating that a configuration is required. The `fd_action_ready` structure is likely used to register or execute the "ready" action within a larger framework or application. The code is part of a system that uses metrics and shared memory to manage the state of distributed computational resources.
# Imports and Dependencies

- `run/run.h`
- `../../../disco/metrics/fd_metrics.h`


# Global Variables

---
### ready\_cmd\_fn
- **Type**: `function`
- **Description**: Executes a command to prepare the system by ensuring all tiles are ready. It checks the status of each tile and waits until they are in a ready state before proceeding.
- **Use**: Used as a function pointer in the `fd_action_ready` structure to define the behavior of the 'ready' action.


---
### fd\_action\_ready
- **Type**: `action_t`
- **Description**: Defines an action named 'ready' that waits for all tiles to be running. It uses the function 'ready_cmd_fn' to execute this action and requires a configuration to operate.
- **Use**: Used to represent an action that checks and waits for the readiness of all tiles in a system.
