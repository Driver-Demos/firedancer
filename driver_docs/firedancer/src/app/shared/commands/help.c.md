Defines a help command function that prints usage instructions and available subcommands.

# Purpose
The code defines a help command function for a command-line application. It includes necessary headers and declares external variables `FD_APP_NAME`, `FD_BINARY_NAME`, and an array of `ACTIONS`. The `help_cmd_fn` function outputs usage instructions and available options for the application, including `--config`, `--version`, and `--help` flags. It also iterates over the `ACTIONS` array to display available subcommands and their descriptions. The `fd_action_help` structure is an instance of `action_t` that represents the help command, specifying its name, function, and description.

### FD\_BINARY\_NAME
- **Type**: ``char const *``
- **Description**: A pointer to a constant character string that represents the name of the binary executable file.
- **Use**: Used in the `help_cmd_fn` function to display the usage information of the binary.


---
### ACTIONS
- **Type**: ``action_t *` array`
- **Description**: An array of pointers to `action_t` structures, where each element represents a specific action with associated metadata such as name, description, and function pointer.
- **Use**: Used to iterate over and execute different actions based on their metadata.
