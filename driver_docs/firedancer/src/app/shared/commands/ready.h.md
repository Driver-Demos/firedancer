Declares the `ready_cmd_fn` function and the `fd_action_ready` external action.

# Purpose
This code is a C header file that declares a function and an external variable related to a command functionality. The function [`ready_cmd_fn`](<#ready_cmd_fn>) takes pointers to `args_t` and `config_t` structures as parameters, indicating it likely processes command arguments and configuration data. The external variable `fd_action_ready` is declared as an `action_t` type, suggesting it represents an action or command that can be executed. The file includes a configuration header `fd_config.h` and uses macro guards to prevent multiple inclusions. The `FD_PROTOTYPES_BEGIN` and `FD_PROTOTYPES_END` macros are used to encapsulate the function prototype, which may be part of a larger framework or library.
