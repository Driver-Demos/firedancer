Header file for the `get_identity` command function and associated action in the Firedancer codebase.

# Purpose
This C header file defines the interface for a command related to identity retrieval within an application. It includes a function prototype for [`get_identity_cmd_fn`](<#get_identity_cmd_fn>), which takes pointers to `args_t` and `config_t` structures as parameters, indicating that it processes command arguments and configuration data. The file also declares an external variable `fd_action_get_identity` of type `action_t`, which likely represents an action or command related to identity. The header uses include guards to prevent multiple inclusions and includes a configuration header file `fd_config.h` to access necessary configuration settings.
