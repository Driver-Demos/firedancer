Header file for the `set_identity` command function and related action in the Firedancer codebase.

# Purpose
This code is a C header file that declares a function and an external variable related to setting an identity in an application. The function [`set_identity_cmd_fn`](<#set_identity_cmd_fn>) takes pointers to `args_t` and `config_t` structures as parameters, indicating it likely processes command arguments and configuration data. The header also declares an external variable `fd_action_set_identity` of type `action_t`, which suggests it is used to represent or trigger the identity-setting action. The file includes a configuration header `fd_config.h` and uses macros `FD_PROTOTYPES_BEGIN` and `FD_PROTOTYPES_END` to manage function prototype declarations. The header guard prevents multiple inclusions of this file, ensuring that the declarations are only processed once during compilation.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `../fd_config.h`


# Global Variables

---
### fd\_action\_set\_identity
- **Type**: ``action_t``
- **Description**: `fd_action_set_identity` is a global variable of type `action_t`. It is declared as an external variable, indicating that its definition is located in another source file.
- **Use**: Used to reference an action related to setting identity within the application.


# Function Declarations (Public API)

---
### set\_identity\_cmd\_fn<!-- {{#callable_declaration:set_identity_cmd_fn}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../../src/app/shared/commands/set_identity.h#L6>)

Executes the identity setting command.
- **Description**: Use this function to execute a command that sets identity parameters based on the provided arguments and configuration. It is important to ensure that both `args` and `config` are properly initialized and valid before calling this function. This function does not return a value and does not handle errors internally, so any necessary error checking should be performed prior to invocation.
- **Inputs**:
    - `args`: A pointer to an `args_t` structure containing the arguments for the identity setting command. Must not be null and should be properly initialized before use.
    - `config`: A pointer to a `config_t` structure containing configuration data necessary for the command. Must not be null and should be properly initialized before use.
- **Output**: None
- **See Also**: [`set_identity_cmd_fn`](<set_identity.c.md#set_identity_cmd_fn>)  (Implementation)
