Defines the version command function and action for the Firedancer application.

# Purpose
This C header file defines the interface for a version command within an application. It includes the necessary configuration header `fd_config.h` and declares the function [`version_cmd_fn`](<#version_cmd_fn>), which takes pointers to `args_t` and `config_t` structures as parameters. The file also declares an external variable `fd_action_version` of type `action_t`. The use of include guards ensures that the file's contents are only included once during compilation, preventing redefinition errors.
# Imports and Dependencies

- **Description**: `fd_action_version` is a global variable of type `action_t`. It is declared as an external variable, indicating that its definition is likely in another source file.
