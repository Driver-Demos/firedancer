Header file for the netconf command function and related action in the Firedancer application.

# Purpose
This code is a C header file that declares a function and an external variable related to network configuration commands. It includes the header file `fd_config.h`, which likely contains configuration settings or definitions used by the function or variable. The function [`netconf_cmd_fn`](<#netconf_cmd_fn>) takes two parameters, `args` and `config`, which are pointers to `args_t` and `config_t` types, respectively, and is intended to perform operations related to network configuration. The external variable `fd_action_netconf` is declared as an `action_t` type, suggesting it represents an action or command related to network configuration. The file uses include guards to prevent multiple inclusions, ensuring that the declarations are only processed once during compilation.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `../fd_config.h`


# Global Variables

---
### fd\_action\_netconf
- **Type**: ``action_t``
- **Description**: A global variable of type `action_t` that is declared as an external variable. It is likely used to represent or store an action related to network configuration.
- **Use**: Used to define or reference an action for network configuration operations.


# Function Declarations (Public API)

---
### netconf\_cmd\_fn<!-- {{#callable_declaration:netconf_cmd_fn}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../../src/app/shared/commands/netconf.h#L6>)

Displays network configuration details.
- **Description**: Use this function to print network configuration details, including interfaces, IPv4 routes, and neighbor tables, to the standard output. It requires a valid configuration object that contains network topology information. The function does not modify the input parameters and does not return any value. Ensure that the configuration object is correctly initialized and populated with network topology data before calling this function.
- **Inputs**:
    - `args`: A pointer to an `args_t` structure. This parameter is not used in the function, and its value is ignored.
    - `config`: A pointer to a `config_t` structure that contains network topology information. Must not be null and must be properly initialized with valid data. The function will log an error if required network components are not found in the topology.
- **Output**: None
- **See Also**: [`netconf_cmd_fn`](<netconf.c.md#netconf_cmd_fn>)  (Implementation)
