Prints network configuration details including interfaces, IPv4 routes, and neighbor tables.

# Purpose
The code defines a function [`netconf_cmd_fn`](<#netconf_cmd_fn>) that is part of a network configuration utility. This function is responsible for printing the current network configuration, including network interfaces, IPv4 routing tables, and neighbor tables. It uses a topology configuration (`fd_topo_t`) to locate and join specific workspaces and tiles that contain the necessary network data. The function retrieves and prints information about network devices, main and local IPv4 routes, and neighbor tables by joining and reading from double buffers and hash maps. The function uses several external libraries for handling network data structures and operations, such as `fd_fib4`, `fd_dbl_buf`, and `fd_neigh4_map`.

The code also defines an `action_t` structure named `fd_action_netconf`, which associates the [`netconf_cmd_fn`](<#netconf_cmd_fn>) function with the action name "netconf". This structure specifies that the action requires a configuration and provides a description of the action's purpose, which is to print the network configuration. The `fd_action_netconf` structure is likely used in a larger framework to register and execute network-related actions based on user input or system events. The code includes several header files that provide necessary definitions and functions for network configuration and management.
# Imports and Dependencies

- `../fd_config.h`
- `../fd_action.h`
- `../../../waltz/ip/fd_fib4.h`
- `../../../waltz/mib/fd_dbl_buf.h`
- `../../../waltz/mib/fd_netdev_tbl.h`
- `../../../waltz/neigh/fd_neigh4_map.h`

# Global Variables

---
### fd\_action\_netconf
- **Type**: ``action_t``
- **Description**: Defines an action named 'netconf' that is used to print network configuration details. It includes a function pointer `fn` that points to `netconf_cmd_fn`, which executes the action. The action requires a configuration (`require_config` is set to 1) and has a description that indicates its purpose.
- **Use**: Used to execute the `netconf_cmd_fn` function to print network configuration when invoked.


# Functions

---
### netconf\_cmd\_fn<!-- {{#callable:netconf_cmd_fn}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../../src/app/shared/commands/netconf.c#L13>)

Prints network configuration details including interfaces, IPv4 routes, and neighbor tables.
- **Inputs**:
    - ``args``: A pointer to an `args_t` structure, which is not used in this function.
    - ``config``: A pointer to a `config_t` structure that contains the network topology information.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Retrieve the network topology from the `config` structure.
    - Find the workspace ID for 'netbase' using `fd_topo_find_wksp` and log an error if not found.
    - Find the tile ID for 'netlnk' using `fd_topo_find_tile` and log an error if not found.
    - Join the 'netbase' workspace in read-only mode.
    - Print the network interfaces by joining the double buffer, reading its contents, and printing them.
    - Print the main IPv4 routes by joining the FIB4 structure and printing its contents.
    - Print the local IPv4 routes by joining the FIB4 structure and printing its contents.
    - Print the neighbor table by joining the neighbor hash map and printing its contents.
- **Output**: No return value; outputs network configuration details to the standard output.
