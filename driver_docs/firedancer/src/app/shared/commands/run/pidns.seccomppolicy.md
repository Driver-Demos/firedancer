Defines a seccomp policy for managing and logging Firedancer child processes within a PID namespace.

# Purpose
The configuration file defines policies for managing the boot process of Firedancer, specifically focusing on the child process that launches tiles within a PID namespace. It specifies logging behavior, where log messages are written to a file and/or STDERR, with 'WARNING' level messages and above being immediately synchronized to disk. The file also outlines the supervision of child tile processes, using `poll()` to detect process exits and `wait4()` to retrieve exit statuses, ensuring that if any child process exits, the entire process group is terminated with a diagnostic message. The configuration ensures that the system handles process exits efficiently, maintaining the integrity of the Firedancer environment.
