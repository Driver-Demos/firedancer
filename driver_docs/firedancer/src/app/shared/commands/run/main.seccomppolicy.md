Defines a seccomp policy for the boot process that creates a PID namespace and supervises a child process.

# Purpose
The configuration file defines policies for the boot process of Firedancer, focusing on process management and logging. It specifies that the boot process creates a child process within a PID namespace and acts as a supervisor, waiting for the child to exit. The file includes configurations for logging, where log messages are written to a file or pipe, with 'WARNING' and above messages also sent to STDERR. The boot process ensures that specific file descriptors are used for STDERR and the logfile. Additionally, it includes instructions for synchronizing log files to disk and handling process termination signals, ensuring that the child process is terminated cleanly before the main process exits. The configuration ensures that the supervisor exits when the child process exits, maintaining orderly process management.
