Seccomp policy for managing logging and process supervision in a PID namespace on arm64.

# Purpose
The configuration file defines security and logging policies for a child process in a PID namespace within the Firedancer system. It specifies that the child process, which is the init process of the PID namespace, will terminate all Firedancer tiles if it is killed. The file includes logging configurations, where log messages are written to a file and/or STDERR, with 'WARNING' and above messages being immediately synchronized to disk. The file also outlines the use of the `wait4` syscall to obtain the exit status of exited processes, ensuring that diagnostic information is printed before terminating the process group. Additionally, the `exit_group` syscall is used to ensure that when a child process exits, the parent process also exits, terminating all associated tiles.
