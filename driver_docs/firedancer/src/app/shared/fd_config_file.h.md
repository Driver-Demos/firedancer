Defines the `fd_config_file` structure for configuration files with name and data attributes.

# Purpose
This code is a C header file that defines a structure and a type alias for handling configuration files. The `fd_config_file` structure contains three members: a pointer to a constant character `name` for the file name, a pointer to constant unsigned characters `data` for the file data, and an unsigned long `data_sz` for the size of the data. The `typedef` statement creates an alias `fd_config_file_t` for the `fd_config_file` structure, simplifying its use in other parts of the program. The header file also includes a base utility header `fd_util_base.h` from a relative path, which may provide additional utility functions or definitions needed by this file. Include guards are used to prevent multiple inclusions of this header file.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `../../util/fd_util_base.h`


# Data Structures

---
### fd\_config\_file
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - ``name``: A pointer to a constant character string that represents the name of the configuration file.
    - ``data``: A pointer to a constant unsigned character array that contains the configuration file data.
    - ``data_sz``: An unsigned long integer that specifies the size of the data in bytes.
- **Description**: Defines a structure to store information about a configuration file, including its name, the data it contains, and the size of that data.

### fd\_config\_file\_t
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - ``name``: A pointer to a constant character string that represents the name of the configuration file.
    - ``data``: A pointer to a constant unsigned character array that contains the data of the configuration file.
    - ``data_sz``: An unsigned long integer that specifies the size of the data in the configuration file.
- **Description**: Defines a structure to represent a configuration file with its name, data, and data size.
