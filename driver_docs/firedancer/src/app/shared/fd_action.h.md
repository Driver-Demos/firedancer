Defines the `fd_action` structure and `fdctl_args` union for managing various application actions.

# Purpose
The code defines a C header file that provides a structure for handling various actions within an application. It includes the definition of a union `fdctl_args`, which encapsulates different sets of parameters for a variety of operations such as `run1`, `monitor`, `watch`, `configure`, `set_identity`, and others. Each member of the union corresponds to a specific action or command, with its own set of parameters. This design allows for flexible handling of different command-line arguments or configuration settings required by the application.

Additionally, the code defines a structure `fd_action`, which represents an action that can be performed by the application. This structure includes fields for the action's name, description, and permission error message, as well as several flags indicating the nature of the action, such as `is_help`, `is_immediate`, and `require_config`. The structure also includes function pointers for handling arguments, topology configuration, permission checks, and the execution of the action itself. This setup facilitates the modular implementation of various actions, allowing the application to manage and execute them in a structured manner.

# Data Structures

### fdctl\_args
- **Type**: ``union``
- **Members**:
    - ``run1``: Contains fields for tile name, kind ID, and pipe file descriptor.
    - ``monitor``: Includes fields for time intervals, seed, nanoseconds per tick, and output file descriptors.
    - ``watch``: Contains a field for the drain output file descriptor.
    - ``configure``: Holds a command and an array of configuration stages.
    - ``set_identity``: Includes fields for tower requirement, force flag, and keypair.
    - ``dev``: Contains fields for parent pipe file descriptor, configuration flags, and debug tile name.
    - ``backtest``: Contains a field for the no-watch flag.
    - ``dev1``: Includes fields for tile name and no-configure flag.
    - ``keys``: Holds a command and file path.
    - ``txn``: Contains fields for payload, count, destination IP, and port.
    - ``dump``: Includes fields for link name, pcap path, and a once flag.
    - ``flame``: Contains a field for the name.
    - ``repair``: Holds paths for manifest and iptable, and flags for metrics and forest.
    - ``load``: Includes fields for affinity, IPs, ports, accounts, connections, and transaction settings.
    - ``quic_trace``: Contains fields for event, dump flags, and trace send option.
    - ``snapshot_load``: Holds a field for tile CPUs.
    - ``udpecho``: Contains a field for the listen port.
    - ``metrics``: Holds a field for topology.
- **Description**: The `fdctl_args` union is a versatile data structure that encapsulates various configurations and parameters for different operational modes or commands. Each member of the union represents a distinct set of parameters tailored for specific functionalities such as monitoring, configuration, identity setting, development, transaction handling, and more. This design allows for efficient memory usage by sharing the same memory space for different command-specific data sets, ensuring that only the relevant data for a particular operation is stored at any given time.

### args\_t
- **Type**: ``union``
- **Members**:
    - ``run1``: Contains fields for tile name, kind ID, and pipe file descriptor.
    - ``monitor``: Includes fields for time intervals, duration, seed, and various flags for monitoring.
    - ``watch``: Contains a field for drain output file descriptor.
    - ``configure``: Holds a command and an array of configuration stages.
    - ``set_identity``: Includes fields for tower requirement, force flag, and keypair.
    - ``dev``: Contains fields for parent pipe file descriptor, various flags, and a debug tile name.
    - ``backtest``: Contains a field for the no-watch flag.
    - ``dev1``: Includes fields for tile name and no-configure flag.
    - ``keys``: Holds a command and a file path.
    - ``txn``: Contains fields for payload, count, destination IP, and port.
    - ``dump``: Includes fields for link name, pcap path, and a once flag.
    - ``flame``: Contains a field for name.
    - ``repair``: Holds paths for manifest and iptable, and flags for metrics and forest.
    - ``load``: Includes fields for affinity, IPs, ports, accounts, connections, and various flags and parameters.
    - ``quic_trace``: Contains fields for event and various dump and trace flags.
    - ``snapshot_load``: Holds a field for tile CPUs.
    - ``udpecho``: Contains a field for listen port.
    - ``metrics``: Includes a field for topology.
- **Description**: The `args_t` data structure is a `union` that encapsulates various command-specific argument structures used in different operational contexts. Each member of the union represents a distinct set of parameters required for specific actions or commands, such as running a process, monitoring, configuring, setting identity, and more. This design allows for flexible and efficient handling of diverse command arguments within a single data structure.
