Makefile for building and testing the `fdctl_shared` library and its components in a Linux environment.

# Purpose
The provided content is a Makefile script used to automate the build process for a software project. It includes conditional compilation directives, such as `ifdef FD_HAS_HOSTED`, `ifdef FD_HAS_LINUX`, and `ifdef FD_HAS_INT128`, which ensure that the build process only proceeds if certain conditions are met. The script defines a shared library target `fdctl_shared` and adds various object files to this target using the `add-objs` function. These object files include components for configuration parsing, object callbacks, unit tests, and various command implementations. Additionally, the script includes targets for unit tests and fuzz tests, such as `test_config_parse` and `fuzz_fdctl_config`, which are executed to verify the functionality and robustness of the code.
