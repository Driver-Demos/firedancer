Defines callback functions for various topology objects, including mcache, dcache, fseq, metrics, and more.

# Purpose
The code defines a set of callback functions for various components in a system that appears to manage different types of data structures or resources. Each component, such as `mcache`, `dcache`, `fseq`, `metrics`, `opaque`, `dbl_buf`, `neigh4_hmap`, `fib4`, `keyswitch`, and `tile`, has associated functions to determine its memory footprint, alignment requirements, and initialization procedures. These functions are encapsulated in structures of type `fd_topo_obj_callbacks_t`, which are used to manage the lifecycle of these components within a topology framework.

The code includes several header files that suggest it is part of a larger system involving metrics, caches, and network-related data structures. The `VAL` macro is used to query configuration properties for each object, ensuring that necessary parameters are set before operations are performed. The `fd_topo_obj_callbacks_t` structures are likely used to register these components with a topology management system, allowing for dynamic configuration and management of resources. The code does not define public APIs or external interfaces directly but provides internal mechanisms for resource management within the system.

Calculates the memory footprint of a tile object in a topology.
- **Inputs**:
    - `topo`: A pointer to a `fd_topo_t` structure representing the topology containing the tile.
    - `obj`: A pointer to a `fd_topo_obj_t` structure representing the object whose tile footprint is to be calculated.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Initialize a pointer `tile` to `NULL`.
    - Iterate over the tiles in the topology using a loop from `0` to `topo->tile_cnt`.
    - Check if the `tile_obj_id` of the current tile matches `obj->id`.
    - If a match is found, set `tile` to point to the current tile and break the loop.
    - Use `FD_TEST` to ensure `tile` is not `NULL` after the loop.
    - Call [`fdctl_tile_run`](<boot/fd_boot.c.md#fdctl_tile_run>) with `tile` to get a `fd_topo_run_tile_t` structure named `runner`.
    - Check if `runner.scratch_footprint` is not `NULL`.
    - If `runner.scratch_footprint` is not `NULL`, return the result of calling `runner.scratch_footprint(tile)`.
    - If `runner.scratch_footprint` is `NULL`, return `0UL`.
- **Output**: The function returns the memory footprint of the tile as an `ulong`. If the footprint cannot be determined, it returns `0UL`.

### tile\_loose<!-- {{#callable:tile_loose}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/app/shared/fd_obj_callbacks.c#L274>)

Calculates the loose footprint of a tile object in a topology.
- **Inputs**:
    - `topo`: A pointer to a `fd_topo_t` structure representing the topology.
    - `obj`: A pointer to a `fd_topo_obj_t` structure representing the object whose loose footprint is to be calculated.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Initialize a pointer `tile` to `NULL`.
    - Iterate over the tiles in the topology using a loop from `0` to `topo->tile_cnt`.
    - In each iteration, check if the `tile_obj_id` of the current tile matches `obj->id`.
    - If a match is found, set `tile` to point to the current tile and break the loop.
    - Use `FD_TEST` to ensure `tile` is not `NULL` after the loop.
    - Call [`fdctl_tile_run`](<boot/fd_boot.c.md#fdctl_tile_run>) with `tile` to get a `fd_topo_run_tile_t` structure named `runner`.
    - Check if `runner.loose_footprint` is not `NULL`.
    - If `runner.loose_footprint` is not `NULL`, call it with `tile` and return the result.
    - If `runner.loose_footprint` is `NULL`, return `0UL`.
- **Output**: Returns the loose footprint of the tile if available, otherwise returns `0UL`.
- **Functions Called**:
    - [`fdctl_tile_run`](<boot/fd_boot.c.md#fdctl_tile_run>)

### tile\_align<!-- {{#callable:tile_align}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/app/shared/fd_obj_callbacks.c#L291>)

Finds the alignment requirement for a specific tile object in a topology.
- **Inputs**:
    - `topo`: A pointer to a `fd_topo_t` structure representing the topology containing the tiles.
    - `obj`: A pointer to a `fd_topo_obj_t` structure representing the object whose tile alignment is to be found.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Initialize a pointer `tile` to `NULL`.
    - Iterate over the tiles in `topo` using a loop with index `i`.
    - Check if the `tile_obj_id` of the current tile matches `obj->id`.
    - If a match is found, set `tile` to point to the current tile and break the loop.
    - Use `FD_TEST` to ensure `tile` is not `NULL` after the loop.
    - Call [`fdctl_tile_run`](<boot/fd_boot.c.md#fdctl_tile_run>) with `tile` to get a `fd_topo_run_tile_t` structure `runner`.
    - Check if `runner.scratch_align` is not `NULL`.
    - If `runner.scratch_align` is not `NULL`, return the result of calling `runner.scratch_align()`.
    - If `runner.scratch_align` is `NULL`, return `1UL`.
- **Output**: Returns the alignment requirement as an `ulong`, either from `runner.scratch_align()` or `1UL` if `runner.scratch_align` is `NULL`.
- **Functions Called**:
    - [`fdctl_tile_run`](<boot/fd_boot.c.md#fdctl_tile_run>)

### fdctl\_tile\_run<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fdctl_tile_run}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/app/shared/fd_obj_callbacks.c#L254>)

Retrieves a tile configuration by name.
- **Description**: Use this function to find and return the configuration of a tile based on its name. It searches through a predefined list of tiles and returns the configuration of the tile that matches the given name. If no matching tile is found, an error is logged, and a default configuration is returned. This function is useful when you need to access specific tile configurations by name.
- **Inputs**:
    - `tile`: A pointer to a `fd_topo_tile_t` structure representing the tile to find. The `name` field of this structure is used for comparison. Must not be null.
- **Output**: Returns a `fd_topo_run_tile_t` structure representing the configuration of the found tile. If no tile is found, returns a default-initialized `fd_topo_run_tile_t`.
- **See Also**: [`fdctl_tile_run`](<boot/fd_boot.c.md#fdctl_tile_run>)  (Implementation)
