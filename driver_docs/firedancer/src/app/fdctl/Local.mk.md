Makefile for managing versioning, building, and dependencies of the fdctl application in Firedancer.

# Purpose
This Makefile is used to automate the build process for a software project that includes components written in both C/C++ and Rust. It defines rules for generating version information, compiling source files, and managing dependencies. The file includes commands to create a version header file (`version2.h`) with version details extracted from environment variables, and it ensures that the main version header (`version.h`) is updated only if changes occur. The Makefile also includes targets for building Rust components using Cargo, with specific handling for different build profiles such as `release` and `release-with-debug`. Additionally, it contains logic to check and update the Rust toolchain and manage submodule consistency. The file ensures that all necessary libraries and binaries are built with the correct dependencies and configurations, optimizing the build process by avoiding unnecessary recompilation.
# Content Summary
This Makefile is part of a build system for a software project that involves version management, compilation, and building of various components. The file includes several key functionalities:

1. **Version Management**: The file manages versioning by including a version file (`with-version.mk`) and generating a header file (`version2.h`) with version information. It defines major, minor, and patch version numbers, as well as a commit reference. If the version changes or the file does not exist, it updates `version.h` from `version2.h`.

2. **Conditional Compilation**: The file uses conditional statements to check for the presence of certain features (`FD_HAS_ALLOCA`, `FD_HAS_DOUBLE`, `FD_HAS_INT128`, `FD_HAS_HOSTED`, `FD_HAS_THREADS`) before proceeding with specific build tasks. This ensures that the build process only includes components that are supported by the current environment.

3. **Object and Library Management**: The file specifies object files and libraries to be included in the build process. It uses macros to add objects and create libraries, such as `fdctl_version`.

4. **Rust Toolchain and Cargo Management**: The file includes targets for managing Rust toolchains and building Rust components. It checks and updates the Rust toolchain version, and defines targets for building Rust binaries and libraries (`cargo-validator`, `cargo-solana`, `cargo-ledger-tool`). It handles different build profiles (`release`, `release-with-debug`) and ensures that all libraries and binaries are built with a single cargo command to optimize build times.

5. **Compiler-Specific Flags**: The file includes conditional settings for compiler flags, particularly addressing issues with specific versions of GCC and Clang compilers by including the `<cstdint>` header.

6. **Submodule Consistency Check**: The file includes a target (`check-agave-hash`) to ensure that the `agave` submodule is up to date with the main repository. It compares the commit hash of the submodule with the main repository and prompts the user to update if they are not aligned.

7. **Build Targets**: The file defines several build targets for creating binaries and libraries, such as `solana` and `agave-ledger-tool`. It includes commands to copy the built artifacts to the appropriate directories.

Overall, this Makefile orchestrates the build process by managing versioning, conditional compilation, Rust toolchain updates, and the compilation of various components, ensuring that the build environment is correctly configured and up to date.
