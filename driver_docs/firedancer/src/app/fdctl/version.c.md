Defines version information and commit references for the fdctl application.

# Purpose
This code is a C source file that defines versioning information for a software component. It includes two header files: `fd_util.h` and `version.h`, which likely provide utility functions and version macros, respectively. The file defines default values for patch version and commit reference using preprocessor directives, which can be overridden if already defined. It declares and initializes several constants: `fdctl_major_version`, `fdctl_minor_version`, and `fdctl_patch_version` for version numbers, `fdctl_commit_ref` for a commit reference in unsigned integer format, and `fdctl_commit_ref_string` for the commit reference as a string. Additionally, it constructs a version string `fdctl_version_string` by concatenating the major, minor, and patch version numbers. This file is used to manage and provide access to version information for the software component.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `../../util/fd_util.h`
- `version.h`


# Global Variables

---
### fdctl\_major\_version
- **Type**: ``ulong``
- **Description**: A constant unsigned long integer that stores the major version number of the software component identified by `FDCTL_MAJOR_VERSION`. This value is defined at compile time and remains constant throughout the execution of the program.
- **Use**: Used to identify the major version of the software component for version control and compatibility checks.


---
### fdctl\_minor\_version
- **Type**: ``ulong``
- **Description**: Represents the minor version number of the software component, defined as a constant of type `ulong`. It is initialized with the value of the macro `FDCTL_MINOR_VERSION`, which is expected to be defined elsewhere in the code.
- **Use**: Used to store and provide the minor version number of the software component.


---
### fdctl\_patch\_version
- **Type**: ``ulong``
- **Description**: Represents the patch version number of the software as an unsigned long integer. It is defined as a constant and initialized with the value of `FDCTL_PATCH_VERSION`, which defaults to 9999 if not defined elsewhere.
- **Use**: Used to store the patch version number of the software for version tracking and display purposes.


---
### fdctl\_commit\_ref
- **Type**: ``uint``
- **Description**: A constant unsigned integer that stores the commit reference as a 32-bit unsigned integer value.
- **Use**: Used to store the commit reference in a numeric format for version control purposes.


---
### fdctl\_commit\_ref\_string
- **Type**: ``char const[]``
- **Description**: A constant character array that stores the commit reference string for the software version control.
- **Use**: Used to hold the commit reference as a string, which is defined by the macro `FDCTL_COMMIT_REF_CSTR`.


---
### fdctl\_version\_string
- **Type**: ``char const[]``
- **Description**: A constant character array that stores the version string of the software. The version string is constructed by concatenating the major, minor, and patch version numbers, each converted to a string, and separated by periods.
- **Use**: Used to represent the version of the software in a human-readable format.
