Imports a default configuration from a TOML file for the fdctl application.

# Purpose
This code is a C source file that includes a utility header file `fd_util.h` from a relative path. It uses the macro `FD_IMPORT_BINARY` to import a binary configuration file named `default.toml` located in the `src/app/fdctl/config` directory. The purpose of this code is to make the contents of the `default.toml` file available as a binary resource within the program, likely for configuration purposes. The `fdctl_default_config` symbol is used to reference this imported configuration data in the application.
