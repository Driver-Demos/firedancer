Configuration settings for development environment, including network namespace and interface options.

# Purpose
The configuration file defines settings for a development environment. Under the `development` section, the `sandbox` option is set to `false`, indicating that the sandbox mode is disabled. The `development.netns` subsection has an `enabled` option set to `true`, which enables network namespace features. In the `net` section, the `interface` is specified as `veth_test_xdp_0`, which sets the network interface to be used.
