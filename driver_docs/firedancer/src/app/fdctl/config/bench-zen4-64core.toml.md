Configuration for benchmarking on an AMD Zen4 CPU with 64 physical and 128 logical cores.

# Purpose
This configuration file is used for benchmarking on an AMD Zen4 CPU with 64 physical cores and 128 logical cores, such as an AMD EPYC 9554P. It specifies various settings for different components of the system. The `layout` section defines the number of tiles for verification, banking, and shredding. The `development.genesis` section sets initial parameters for account funding and the number of hashes per tick. The `development.bench` section configures benchmarking parameters, including tile counts and block cost limits, and disables certain features like blockstore from a specific slot and status cache. The `rpc` section controls transaction history and metadata storage settings. Finally, the `tiles.gui` and `tiles.pack` sections manage GUI enablement and the use of consumed compute units, respectively.
