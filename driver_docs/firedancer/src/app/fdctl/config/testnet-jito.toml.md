Configuration file for the Solana testnet with settings for gossip, snapshots, consensus, RPC, and tiles.

# Purpose
The configuration file defines settings for a Solana validator node. The `scratch_directory` specifies the directory for temporary data storage. The `[gossip]` section lists entry points for network communication with other nodes. The `[snapshots]` section sets the minimum download speed for snapshots, ensuring efficient data synchronization. The `[consensus]` section includes paths to key files and a list of known validators, which are essential for maintaining consensus and validating transactions. The `[rpc]` section configures the RPC server, including the port and API access settings. The `[layout]` section configures shred tiles to manage computational overhead. The `[reporting]` section provides metrics configuration for performance monitoring. The `[tiles.bundle]` section enables a bundle service with specified URLs and program addresses for tip distribution and payment. Finally, the `[tiles.gui]` section sets the listening address for the graphical user interface.
