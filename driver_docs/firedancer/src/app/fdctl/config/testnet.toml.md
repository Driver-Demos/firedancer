Configuration for a Solana testnet with gossip entrypoints, consensus settings, RPC, layout, and reporting.

# Purpose
The configuration file defines settings for a Solana testnet environment. The `[gossip]` section specifies entry points for network communication, listing multiple server addresses and ports. The `[consensus]` section includes the expected genesis hash and a list of known validators, which are essential for maintaining network integrity and validating transactions. The `[rpc]` section configures the Remote Procedure Call (RPC) server, setting the port to `8899` and enabling the full API while marking it as private. The `[layout]` section configures the number of shred tiles to handle computational overhead, which is necessary due to the expanded validator peer set in the testnet. Finally, the `[reporting]` section provides the configuration for sending metrics to a specified host, database, and credentials, facilitating performance monitoring and analysis.
