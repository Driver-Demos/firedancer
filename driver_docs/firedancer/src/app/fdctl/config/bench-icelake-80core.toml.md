Configuration for benchmarking on an Intel Icelake CPU with AVX512 support and 80 physical cores.

# Purpose
The configuration file is designed for benchmarking on an Intel Icelake CPU with AVX512 support, specifically for a 1.4 Milestone demo. It is optimized for a dual-socket CPU setup with 80 physical cores, where the CPU IDs are distributed across two NUMA nodes. The file specifies a dynamic port range from `8100-8200` and sets a scratch directory at `/dev/shm/fd1`. The `[layout]` section defines CPU affinity and tile counts for various operations, while the `[development.genesis]` and `[development.bench]` sections configure initial account funding and benchmarking parameters, respectively. The `[rpc]` section controls transaction history and metadata storage, and the `[tiles.shred]` section sets the maximum number of pending shred sets to `16384`.
