Configuration for benchmarking on a Zen3 CPU with specific core and thread settings.

# Purpose
The configuration file is designed for benchmarking on a Zen3 CPU, such as the AMD EPYC 7513, with specific expectations for core and thread allocation. It defines several sections, including `ledger`, `layout`, `development.genesis`, `development.bench`, `rpc`, and `tiles.shred`. The `ledger` section specifies the path for ledger storage. The `layout` section configures CPU affinity and tile counts for various operations. The `development.genesis` section sets the initial number of funded accounts. The `development.bench` section configures benchmarking parameters, including tile counts and affinity settings, and enables larger cost and shred limits per block. The `rpc` section controls transaction history and metadata storage settings. Finally, the `tiles.shred` section sets the maximum number of pending shred sets.
