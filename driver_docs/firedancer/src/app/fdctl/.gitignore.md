Specifies files to ignore in version control, including version.h and version2.h.

# Purpose
The content specifies a list of header files, `version.h` and `version2.h`. These files are likely used in a software project to define version-related information or constants. Including these headers in source files allows the software to access version data, which can be useful for version control, debugging, or display purposes.
