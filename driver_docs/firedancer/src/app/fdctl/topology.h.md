Header file for initializing topology with a given configuration in the Firedancer application.

# Purpose
This code is a C header file that defines the interface for initializing a topology configuration. It includes a header file `fd_config.h` from a shared directory, which suggests that it relies on shared configuration settings or structures. The file declares a single function, [`fd_topo_initialize`](<#fd_topo_initialize>), which takes a pointer to a `config_t` structure as an argument. The use of include guards (`#ifndef`, `#define`, `#endif`) prevents multiple inclusions of this header file, ensuring that the function prototype is only declared once during compilation. The `FD_PROTOTYPES_BEGIN` and `FD_PROTOTYPES_END` macros likely encapsulate the function prototype to manage specific compiler or project settings.
