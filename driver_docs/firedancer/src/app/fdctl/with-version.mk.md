Defines versioning rules and exports version variables for the Firedancer project.

# Purpose
The file defines versioning information for the Frankendancer project, which is part of the Firedancer software. It sets the major version to zero, indicating that the first full release will be version 1.0. The minor version is specific to Firedancer and indicates the release candidate branch, while the patch version encodes the Agave version being linked, transforming it into a numeric format. If the Agave submodule is not checked out, the patch version defaults to 9999. Additionally, the file exports the current Git commit hash as `FIREDANCER_CI_COMMIT` for use in continuous integration processes.
