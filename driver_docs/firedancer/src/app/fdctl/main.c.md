Main function for the `fdctl` application, initializing configurations, callbacks, stages, tiles, and actions.

# Purpose
The code is part of a C program that appears to be related to a system named "Frankendancer," with a binary called `fdctl`. It includes several header files, indicating dependencies on external modules for topology management, configuration, and command execution. The code defines arrays of callback functions, configuration stages, tiles, and actions, which are likely used to manage different aspects of the system's operation. These arrays, such as `CALLBACKS`, `STAGES`, `TILES`, and `ACTIONS`, are collections of pointers to various objects and functions that are used to configure and run the system.

The [`main`](<#main>) function initializes a default configuration and calls `fd_main`, passing command-line arguments and a configuration array. This suggests that the code is part of an executable that initializes and runs the system based on the provided configurations. Additionally, there is a function [`add_bench_topo`](<#add_bench_topo>) that seems to be a placeholder for adding a benchmark topology, although it currently does not perform any operations. This function takes several parameters related to network and transaction settings, indicating its potential use in configuring test or monitoring scenarios.
