Declares the function and action for running the Agave command with specified arguments and configuration.

# Purpose
This code is a C header file that declares a function and an external variable related to running a command named `agave`. The function [`run_agave_cmd_fn`](<#run_agave_cmd_fn>) takes two pointers as parameters: `args_t * args` and `config_t * config`, which likely represent command arguments and configuration settings, respectively. The header file also declares an external variable `fd_action_run_agave` of type `action_t`, which suggests it is used to define or reference an action associated with the `agave` command. The inclusion guards prevent multiple inclusions of this header file, ensuring that the declarations are only processed once during compilation.
