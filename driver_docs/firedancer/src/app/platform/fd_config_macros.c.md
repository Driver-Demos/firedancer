Macros for extracting configuration values from a pod structure in various formats.

# Purpose
The code defines a set of macros for extracting configuration values from a data structure referred to as a "pod." These macros facilitate the retrieval and removal of configuration data from the pod, which is likely a structured data container. The macros include `CFG_POP`, `CFG_POP1`, `CFG_POP_ARRAY`, `CFG_POP1_ARRAY`, `CFG_POP_TABLE`, and `CFG_POP_TABLE_FINI`. Each macro is designed to handle different types of configuration data, such as single values, arrays, and tables, and they ensure that the extracted data is stored in a specified configuration structure.

The macros use a consistent pattern to query the pod for a specific key, check the type of the retrieved data, and then extract the data into a configuration structure. If the data type does not match the expected type, or if there are too many values, the macros log a warning and return `NULL`. The macros also remove the extracted data from the pod after processing. These macros are intended to be used in a context where configuration data needs to be dynamically extracted and managed, providing a streamlined way to handle various data types within a configuration management system.
