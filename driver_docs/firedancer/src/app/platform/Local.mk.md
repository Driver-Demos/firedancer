Makefile for building protocol-agnostic fdctl code with config parsing and system utilities.

# Purpose
The Makefile content defines build instructions for a software project. It uses a function `make-lib` to create a library named `fdctl_platform`, which is protocol-agnostic and depends on other components like `ballet` and `util`. The file specifies header files and object files for different utilities, such as configuration parsing (`fd_config_extract.h`), system utilities (`fd_sys_util.h`), network utilities (`fd_net_util.h`), and file utilities (`fd_file_util.h`). Each utility is associated with the `fdctl_platform` library, ensuring that the necessary components are compiled and linked correctly during the build process. The use of `add-hdrs` and `add-objs` functions helps organize and manage the inclusion of headers and object files in the build.
