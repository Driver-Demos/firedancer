Defines the main function for the Firedancer application, initializing configurations, callbacks, stages, tiles, and actions.

# Purpose
The code is an executable C program that serves as the main entry point for a software application named "Firedancer." It includes several header files that provide necessary declarations and configurations for the application. The program defines several arrays of pointers to callback functions, configuration stages, and actions, which are used to manage different aspects of the application's operation. These arrays, such as `CALLBACKS`, `STAGES`, `TILES`, and `ACTIONS`, organize various components and functionalities that the application can execute or configure.

The [`main`](<#main>) function initializes configuration files for different network environments, such as testnet, devnet, and mainnet, and then calls the `fd_dev_main` function. This function is responsible for starting the application with the provided command-line arguments and configurations. The inclusion of external callback and action declarations suggests that the program is part of a larger system where these components interact to perform complex tasks. The code is structured to support modularity and extensibility, allowing for the addition of new functionalities through the defined arrays and external components.

### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/app/firedancer-dev/main.c#L228>)

Initializes configuration files and calls `fd_dev_main` with these configurations and other parameters.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments.
    - `argv`: An array of command-line arguments.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Initialize `_default` with the default configuration file using `fd_config_file_default()`.
    - Initialize `testnet` with the testnet configuration file using `fd_config_file_testnet()`.
    - Initialize `devnet` with the devnet configuration file using `fd_config_file_devnet()`.
    - Initialize `mainnet` with the mainnet configuration file using `fd_config_file_mainnet()`.
    - Create an array `configs` containing pointers to the initialized configuration files and a `NULL` terminator.
    - Call `fd_dev_main` with `argc`, `argv`, a constant integer `1`, the `configs` array, and the function `fd_topo_initialize`.
- **Output**: The return value of the `fd_dev_main` function.
