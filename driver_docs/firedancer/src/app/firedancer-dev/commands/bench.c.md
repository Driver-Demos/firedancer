Defines a command for testing validator TPS benchmarks with a function that pauses indefinitely.

# Purpose
The code defines a command action for a benchmarking tool in a C program. It includes headers for shared development commands and the `unistd.h` library for POSIX operating system API access. The function [`firedancer_dev_bench_cmd_fn`](<#firedancer_dev_bench_cmd_fn>) is implemented to execute a benchmark command by calling `bench_cmd_fn` with the provided arguments and configuration. After executing the benchmark, the function enters an infinite loop using `pause()` to keep the parent thread active until it is terminated by a signal such as Ctrl+C. The `fd_action_bench` structure defines the action with properties such as its name, arguments, function pointer, permissions, and a description indicating that it tests the validator's transactions per second (TPS) benchmark.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `../../shared_dev/commands/bench/bench.h`
- `../../shared_dev/commands/dev.h`
- `unistd.h`


# Global Variables

---
### fd\_action\_bench
- **Type**: ``action_t``
- **Description**: Defines an action structure for a benchmark command in a development environment. It includes the name of the action, the arguments it takes, the function to execute, the permissions required, a flag indicating if it is for a local cluster, and a description of the action.
- **Use**: Used to configure and execute a benchmark command to test validator TPS in a development environment.


# Functions

---
### firedancer\_dev\_bench\_cmd\_fn<!-- {{#callable:firedancer_dev_bench_cmd_fn}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../../src/app/firedancer-dev/commands/bench.c#L6>)

Calls `bench_cmd_fn` with given arguments and then pauses indefinitely.
- **Inputs**:
    - `args`: Pointer to `args_t` structure containing command-line arguments.
    - `config`: Pointer to `config_t` structure containing configuration settings.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Call `bench_cmd_fn` with `args` and `config` as parameters.
    - Enter an infinite loop that calls `pause()` to suspend execution until a signal is received.
- **Output**: No output is returned as the function does not terminate under normal conditions.
