Defines a command to dump the state of a gossip tile, including contact information and sockets.

# Purpose
The code defines a function [`gossip_dump_cmd_fn`](<#gossip_dump_cmd_fn>) and an `action_t` structure `fd_action_gossip_dump`. The function [`gossip_dump_cmd_fn`](<#gossip_dump_cmd_fn>) is responsible for retrieving and displaying information about a "gossip" tile from a network topology configuration. It uses the `fd_topo_find_tile` function to locate the tile by name and checks for errors if the tile is not found. The function then accesses the workspace associated with the tile in read-only mode and retrieves the contact information of the tile. It prints the public key, shred version, and socket information of the tile's contact info to the standard output.

The `fd_action_gossip_dump` structure defines an action with the name "gossip-dump" and associates it with the [`gossip_dump_cmd_fn`](<#gossip_dump_cmd_fn>) function. This structure specifies that the action requires a configuration and provides a description of the action's purpose, which is to dump the state of the gossip tile. The code is part of a larger system that manages network topology and communication, and it is intended to be used as a command or utility to inspect the state of a specific component within that system.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `../../shared/fd_config.h`
- `../../shared/fd_action.h`
- `../../../discof/gossip/fd_gossip_tile.h`
- `../../../util/net/fd_ip4.h`
- `stdio.h`


# Global Variables

---
### fd\_action\_gossip\_dump
- **Type**: ``action_t``
- **Description**: Defines an action for dumping the state of a gossip tile. It includes the name of the action, a function pointer to execute the action, and a description of the action.
- **Use**: Used to configure and execute the gossip dump command within the application.


# Functions

---
### gossip\_dump\_cmd\_fn<!-- {{#callable:gossip_dump_cmd_fn}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../../src/app/firedancer-dev/commands/gossip_dump.c#L8>)

Retrieves and displays the contact information of a gossip tile from the configuration.
- **Inputs**:
    - ``args``: A pointer to an `args_t` structure, which is not used in this function.
    - ``config``: A pointer to a `config_t` structure that contains the topology information needed to locate and access the gossip tile.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Retrieve the topology from the `config` structure.
    - Find the tile ID for the gossip tile using `fd_topo_find_tile`. If not found, log an error and exit.
    - Retrieve the tile object ID and workspace ID from the topology using the tile ID.
    - Join the workspace in read-only mode using `fd_topo_join_workspace`.
    - Get the gossip tile context using `fd_topo_obj_laddr`.
    - Copy the contact information from the context to a local variable `my_ci`.
    - Print the public key in Base58 format and the shred version from `my_ci`.
    - Iterate over the sockets in `my_ci` and print their protocol number, IP address, and port if they are non-zero.
- **Output**: No return value; outputs the contact information to the standard output.
