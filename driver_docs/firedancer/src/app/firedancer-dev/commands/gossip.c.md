Implements a command for configuring and running a gossip protocol in a network topology, including metrics collection and display.

# Purpose
The code is a C source file that defines a module for managing and monitoring a network topology with a focus on gossip protocol operations. It includes functions to configure, run, and monitor various components of a network topology, specifically focusing on gossip and related network tiles. The code imports several headers that provide shared commands, configuration structures, and network topology utilities, indicating that it is part of a larger system.

The main components of the code include functions for configuring and running gossip commands ([`gossip_cmd_fn`](<#gossip_cmd_fn>), `gossip_cmd_perm`, [`gossip_cmd_topo`](<#gossip_cmd_topo>)), as well as functions for formatting and displaying metrics ([`fmt_count`](<#fmt_count>), [`fmt_bytes`](<#fmt_bytes>), [`fmt_pct`](<#fmt_pct>)). The code defines structures and functions to handle multiple gossip verification tiles (`gossvf_tiles_t`, [`collect_gossvf_tiles`](<#collect_gossvf_tiles>)) and aggregates metrics across these tiles. The [`rx_deltas_aggregated`](<#rx_deltas_aggregated>) function calculates the differences in received and transmitted message counts and bytes for various message types, such as pull requests and responses, push messages, and ping/pong messages. The code also includes a static `fd_action_gossip` structure that defines the gossip action with its associated functions, indicating that this module is part of a larger framework that manages network actions.
