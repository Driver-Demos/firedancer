Makefile logic to add `send_test` objects if `FD_HAS_INT128` is defined.

# Purpose
The `Makefile` snippet conditionally adds objects to the build process. If the macro `FD_HAS_INT128` is defined, it calls the function `add-objs` with the arguments `send_test` and `fd_firedancer_dev`. This inclusion is part of the build configuration, allowing the build system to compile specific components based on the presence of 128-bit integer support.
