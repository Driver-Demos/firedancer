Defines a command to start a development validator in the Firedancer application.

# Purpose
This code defines a function and a structure for handling a development command in a C program. The function [`firedancer_dev_dev_cmd_fn`](<#firedancer_dev_dev_cmd_fn>) takes two parameters, `args` and `config`, and calls the `dev_cmd_fn` function with these parameters and a `NULL` value. The `fd_action_dev` structure is an instance of `action_t` that specifies the properties of the "dev" action, including its name, arguments, function pointer, permissions, a flag indicating it is for a local cluster, and a description. The purpose of this code is to set up and execute a development validator command within a larger system, likely related to a development environment or toolchain.

[View Source →](<../../../../../../src/app/firedancer-dev/commands/dev.c#L3>)

Calls the `dev_cmd_fn` function with the provided arguments and a `NULL` value.
- **Inputs**:
    - `args`: A pointer to an `args_t` structure that contains the arguments for the command.
    - `config`: A pointer to a `config_t` structure that contains the configuration for the command.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Calls the `dev_cmd_fn` function with `args`, `config`, and `NULL` as the third argument.
- **Output**: No direct output; it relies on the behavior of `dev_cmd_fn`.
