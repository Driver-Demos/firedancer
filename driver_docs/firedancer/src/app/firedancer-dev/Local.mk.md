Makefile for building and integrating the `firedancer-dev` application with various dependencies.

# Purpose
The `Makefile` content defines build instructions for the `firedancer-dev` target. It uses conditional compilation to check for the presence of specific features or libraries, such as `FD_HAS_HOSTED`, `FD_HAS_LINUX`, `FD_HAS_ALLOCA`, `FD_HAS_DOUBLE`, `FD_HAS_INT128`, `FD_HAS_ZSTD`, and `FD_HAS_SECP256K1`. If all these conditions are met, the file adds object files from various command directories to the `fd_firedancer_dev` target using the `add-objs` function. It also defines a `.PHONY` target for `firedancer-dev` to ensure it is always executed. If the `FD_HAS_SSE` condition is true, it compiles the `firedancer-dev` binary with specified dependencies and libraries. If the required conditions are not met, a warning is issued indicating that the `firedancer-dev` build is disabled due to the absence of `zstd`.
