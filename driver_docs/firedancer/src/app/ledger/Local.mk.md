Makefile logic for building the fd_ledger tool with dependencies on RocksDB and secp256k1.

# Purpose
The `Makefile` content controls the build process for the `fd_ledger` tool. It checks for the presence of `ROCKSDB` and `SECP256K1` libraries using conditional statements. If both libraries are available, it compiles the `fd_ledger` binary with specified dependencies. If either library is missing, it issues a warning indicating that the build is disabled due to the absence of the required library.
