Defines a parameterized map for `fd_groove_meta_t` elements with custom key and element operations.

# Purpose
The code defines a specialized map implementation for handling `fd_groove_meta_t` elements, using a set of macros to configure the behavior and characteristics of the map. The map is designed to store elements of type `fd_groove_meta_t` and uses `fd_groove_key_t` as the key type. The macros define how keys are compared (`MAP_KEY_EQ`), how keys are hashed (`MAP_KEY_HASH`), and how elements are identified as free or occupied (`MAP_ELE_IS_FREE`). The code also specifies how to free an element (`MAP_ELE_FREE`) and how to move an element from one location to another (`MAP_ELE_MOVE`).

The map implementation is parameterized and includes a versioning system (`MAP_VERSION_T`) and a maximum lock count (`MAP_LOCK_MAX`). The `MAP_MAGIC` constant is used to identify the version of the map. The code includes a template implementation from `fd_map_slot_para.c`, which suggests that the map is part of a larger framework or library that uses templates to generate specific map instances. This code is likely intended to be part of a larger system where `fd_groove_meta_t` elements need to be efficiently stored, retrieved, and managed.
