Tests the functionality and operations of groove volume pools in shared memory.

# Purpose
The code is a C program that tests the functionality of a shared memory management system for handling "groove" data volumes. It includes static assertions to verify the alignment, footprint, and other properties of the `fd_groove_volume_t` structure. The program uses a shared memory segment to allocate and manage groove volumes, either by joining an existing named segment or by creating an anonymous one. It initializes a random number generator and processes command-line arguments to configure the test environment, such as the number of volumes and page size.

The main functionality involves creating a test volume pool and performing operations to add and remove volumes from this pool. The program uses a buffer to store volume information and tests various conditions to ensure the integrity and correctness of the volume pool operations. It includes error handling and logging to provide feedback on the operations performed. The program concludes by cleaning up resources, such as releasing shared memory and deleting the random number generator, before exiting.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `fd_groove.h`


# Global Variables

---
### shmem
- **Type**: ``uchar[]``
- **Description**: An array of unsigned characters with a size defined by `SHMEM_MAX`. It is used to store shared memory data.
- **Use**: Stores shared memory data for allocation and management within the program.


---
### shmem\_cnt
- **Type**: ``ulong``
- **Description**: A static global variable of type `ulong` that is initialized to 0UL. It is used to track the current offset in the shared memory array `shmem`.
- **Use**: Tracks the current offset in the shared memory array `shmem` for memory allocation purposes.


# Functions

---
### shmem\_alloc<!-- {{#callable:shmem_alloc}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../src/groove/test_groove_volume.c#L17>)

Allocates a block of shared memory with specified alignment and size.
- **Inputs**:
    - `a`: The alignment requirement for the memory block.
    - `s`: The size of the memory block to allocate.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Aligns the current position in the shared memory array `shmem` to the specified alignment `a` using `fd_ulong_align_up`.
    - Calculates the new position in the shared memory array by adding the size `s` to the aligned position.
    - Updates the `shmem_cnt` to reflect the new position in the shared memory array.
    - Checks if the updated `shmem_cnt` exceeds the maximum allowed size `SHMEM_MAX` using `FD_TEST`.
    - Returns a pointer to the aligned memory block.
- **Output**: A pointer to the allocated memory block with the specified alignment and size.


---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../src/groove/test_groove_volume.c#L26>)

Initializes, configures, and tests a shared memory volume pool for groove data volumes.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments.
    - `argv`: An array of command-line argument strings.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Calls `fd_boot` to initialize the environment with command-line arguments.
    - Initializes a random number generator `rng`.
    - Parses command-line arguments to get `name`, `volume_cnt`, `_page_sz`, and `near_cpu`.
    - Checks if `name` is provided to join an existing shared memory volume or creates a new anonymous shared memory volume.
    - Logs the configuration details and initializes the shared memory volume `volume`.
    - Allocates and initializes a test volume pool `shpool`.
    - Joins the volume pool `pool` with the shared memory volume `volume`.
    - Defines a buffer `buf` for testing volume pool operations.
    - Performs a series of tests on the volume pool operations, including adding and removing volumes.
    - Iterates 100,000 times to randomly add and remove volumes from the pool, checking the integrity of each operation.
    - Logs the destruction of the test volume pool and cleans up resources.
    - Leaves or releases the shared memory volume based on whether `name` was specified.
    - Deletes the random number generator and halts the program.
- **Output**: Returns 0 to indicate successful execution.
- **Functions Called**:
    - [`shmem_alloc`](<#shmem_alloc>)
    - [`fd_groove_volume_pool_add`](<fd_groove_volume.c.md#fd_groove_volume_pool_add>)
    - [`fd_groove_volume_pool_remove`](<fd_groove_volume.c.md#fd_groove_volume_pool_remove>)
