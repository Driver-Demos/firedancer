Header file for including `fd_groove_data.h` and its dependencies in the Firedancer codebase.

# Purpose
This code is a C header file that uses include guards to prevent multiple inclusions of the same header, which can cause compilation errors. The file conditionally includes the `fd_groove_data.h` header, which itself includes other headers such as `fd_groove_meta.h` and `fd_groove_volume.h`. The comment indicates that the code can function without `FD_HAS_ATOMIC`, but it will not be safe for concurrent use in such a case. This suggests that the code is part of a larger system that may involve concurrent operations, and the included headers likely define data structures or functions related to the "groove" functionality.
