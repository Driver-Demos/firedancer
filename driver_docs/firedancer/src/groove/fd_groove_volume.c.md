Functions for adding and removing volumes in a groove volume pool with memory alignment checks.

# Purpose
The code defines a pool management system for `fd_groove_volume_t` structures, which are likely used to manage memory allocations in a specific application. The file includes a header `fd_groove_volume.h` and uses a template from `fd_pool_para.c` to implement a parameterized pool. The pool is defined with specific parameters such as `POOL_NAME`, `POOL_ELE_T`, `POOL_IDX_WIDTH`, and `POOL_MAGIC`, which configure the pool's behavior and characteristics.

The code provides two main functions: [`fd_groove_volume_pool_add`](<#fd_groove_volume_pool_add>) and [`fd_groove_volume_pool_remove`](<#fd_groove_volume_pool_remove>). The [`fd_groove_volume_pool_add`](<#fd_groove_volume_pool_add>) function adds a range of `fd_groove_volume_t` structures to the pool, initializing them and ensuring they are correctly aligned and within valid memory bounds. It also handles the initialization of metadata such as `info_sz` and `magic` to mark the volumes as empty. The [`fd_groove_volume_pool_remove`](<#fd_groove_volume_pool_remove>) function removes a volume from the pool, ensuring it is valid and marking it as no longer part of the pool. These functions are designed to manage the lifecycle of memory allocations within the pool, providing a mechanism to add and remove memory blocks safely.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `fd_groove_volume.h`
- `../util/tmpl/fd_pool_para.c`


# Functions

### fd\_groove\_volume\_pool\_add<!-- {{#callable:fd_groove_volume_pool_add}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../src/groove/fd_groove_volume.c#L10>)

Adds a memory region to a groove volume pool, formatting it as empty volumes and pushing them into the free pool.
- **Inputs**:
    - `pool`: A pointer to the `fd_groove_volume_pool_t` structure representing the groove volume pool.
    - `shmem`: A pointer to the shared memory region to add to the pool.
    - `footprint`: The size of the memory region in bytes.
    - `info`: A pointer to additional information to store in each volume.
    - `info_sz`: The size of the additional information in bytes.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Check if `footprint` is zero; if so, return `FD_GROOVE_SUCCESS` as there is nothing to add.
    - Check if `pool` is NULL; if so, log a warning and return `FD_GROOVE_ERR_INVAL`.
    - Calculate the start and end pointers of the pool's volume array and the memory region to add.
    - Validate that the memory region is within the pool's bounds and aligned correctly; if not, log a warning and return `FD_GROOVE_ERR_INVAL`.
    - Determine the size of the information to copy, ensuring it does not exceed `FD_GROOVE_VOLUME_INFO_MAX`.
    - Iterate over the memory region in reverse order, formatting each volume as empty and copying the information if provided.
    - Set the `magic` field to indicate the volume contains no data allocations, and release each volume into the pool.
    - If releasing a volume fails, log a warning and return the error code.
    - Return `FD_GROOVE_SUCCESS` after all volumes are added.
- **Output**: Returns `FD_GROOVE_SUCCESS` on success or an error code if an invalid input is detected or if releasing a volume fails.

### fd\_groove\_volume\_pool\_remove<!-- {{#callable:fd_groove_volume_pool_remove}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../src/groove/fd_groove_volume.c#L71>)

Removes a volume from the groove volume pool and returns it if available.
- **Inputs**:
    - `pool`: A pointer to the `fd_groove_volume_pool_t` structure representing the groove volume pool.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Check if `pool` is NULL; if so, log a warning and return NULL.
    - Attempt to acquire a volume from the pool using `fd_groove_volume_pool_acquire`; store the result in `_volume`.
    - If `_volume` is successfully acquired, perform additional checks in paranoid mode to ensure the volume is valid and aligned.
    - If the volume is valid, mark it as no longer a groove volume by setting its `magic` field to 0UL.
    - If acquiring the volume fails and the error is not `FD_POOL_ERR_EMPTY`, log a warning with the error details.
- **Output**: Returns a pointer to the removed `fd_groove_volume_t` if successful, or NULL if the pool is empty or an error occurs.
