Autogenerated configuration table for `fd_groove_data_szc_cfg_t` with 32 entries.

# Purpose
The code defines a constant array `fd_groove_data_szc_cfg` of type `fd_groove_data_szc_cfg_t`, which contains 32 elements. Each element in the array is a structure that holds configuration data, including an unsigned integer and three unsigned characters. The array is initialized with specific values that appear to represent configuration settings or parameters, possibly related to memory or data management, as indicated by the presence of terms like `sb_footprint` in the comments.

The array is likely used to provide predefined configuration settings that can be accessed by other parts of a program. The inclusion of the header file `fd_groove_data.h` suggests that the structure `fd_groove_data_szc_cfg_t` is defined there, and the array is intended to be used in conjunction with other components defined in that header. The comments next to each element provide additional context, such as the `sb_footprint` value, which may be relevant for understanding the memory or resource implications of each configuration.
