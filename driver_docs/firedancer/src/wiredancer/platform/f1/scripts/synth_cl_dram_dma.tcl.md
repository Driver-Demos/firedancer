A TCL script for synthesizing FPGA designs on Amazon's platform, including reading design files and IP blocks.

# Purpose
This script is a configuration file for the Amazon FPGA Hardware Development Kit (HDK). It automates the process of setting up and synthesizing FPGA designs by defining parameters, creating projects, and managing design files. The script configures clock constraints, reads custom logic files, and includes necessary design files and intellectual property (IP) blocks. It also handles the synthesis process by setting up the compile order and executing the synthesis command with specified options. Additionally, the script manages constraints files and ensures that the synthesis process adheres to the defined parameters, while also providing error handling for resource utilization issues.
# Content Summary
This file is a script for the Amazon FPGA Hardware Development Kit (HDK). It is used to automate the process of setting up and synthesizing FPGA designs. The script is written in Tcl and is executed in a hardware design environment to manage various tasks related to FPGA development.

Key functional details include:

1. **License Information**: The script begins with a license notice, indicating that it is distributed under the Amazon Software License. Users must comply with this license to use the script.

2. **Parameter Configuration**: The script sets parameters to avoid clock name collisions and initializes variables for custom logic modules and Verilog defines.

3. **Project Creation**: It creates an in-memory project for a specified FPGA device type, ensuring that the project is set up correctly for further operations.

4. **Clock Generation**: The script calls another script, `aws_gen_clk_constraints.tcl`, to generate clock constraints based on a developer-specified recipe. This is crucial for ensuring that the design's timing requirements are met.

5. **Design File Management**: The script sets directories for encrypted source files and reads various Verilog files necessary for the design. It includes both user-defined and AWS-provided design files.

6. **IP Block Reading**: The script reads Intellectual Property (IP) blocks, including DDR IP and AXI register slices, which are essential components for FPGA designs.

7. **Constraint Management**: It reads constraint files that define the design's physical and timing constraints. Some constraints are auto-generated by AWS and should not be modified by the user.

8. **Synthesis Process**: The script initiates the synthesis process for the custom logic module, specifying include directories, top module, and synthesis options. It checks for resource utilization errors and writes a post-synthesis checkpoint.

9. **Project Closure**: After synthesis, the script closes the project and resets parameters to their default values.

This script is essential for developers working with AWS FPGAs, as it automates the setup, synthesis, and management of FPGA design projects, ensuring that all necessary files and constraints are correctly handled.
