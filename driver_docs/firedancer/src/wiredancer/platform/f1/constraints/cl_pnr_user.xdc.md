Defines CL-specific constraints for top-level PNR by creating and configuring pblocks.

# Purpose
The file configures physical constraints for a top-level place-and-route (PNR) process in a hardware design, specifically for a design using programmable logic devices. It defines partition blocks, known as `pblocks`, which are used to group and manage the placement of specific cells within the design hierarchy. The file creates three main `pblocks`: `pblock_CL_top`, `pblock_CL_mid`, and `pblock_CL_bot`, each containing specific cells filtered by their hierarchical names. These `pblocks` are resized to fit within specified regions of the hardware, such as clock regions and slices, to optimize the design's performance and resource utilization. The file also sets properties like `SNAPPING_MODE` and assigns parent-child relationships between `pblocks` to ensure proper hierarchical organization and placement within the design.
# Content Summary
The provided content is a configuration script for defining and managing physical block (pblock) constraints in a top-level place-and-route (PNR) process for a hardware design. The script is written in a format typically used for FPGA design tools, where pblocks are used to group and constrain logic cells to specific regions of the FPGA fabric.

Key functional details include:

1. **Pblock Creation and Management**: The script creates three main pblocks: `pblock_CL_top`, `pblock_CL_mid`, and `pblock_CL_bot`. Each pblock is associated with specific logic cells and is assigned to distinct regions of the FPGA.

2. **Cell Assignment**: Logic cells are added to each pblock using the `add_cells_to_pblock` command. The cells are selected based on hierarchical names and filters that match specific patterns. This ensures that related logic is grouped together within the same pblock.

3. **Pblock Resizing**: The script resizes each pblock to cover specific regions of the FPGA. This is done using the `resize_pblock` command, which specifies the coordinates of the regions, such as `CLOCKREGION`, `SLICE`, `DSP48E2`, `LAGUNA`, `RAMB18`, `RAMB36`, and `URAM288`.

4. **Hierarchy and Parent-Child Relationships**: The script sets parent-child relationships between pblocks using the `set_property PARENT` command. This organizes the pblocks into a hierarchy, which can be important for managing complex designs.

5. **Snapping Mode**: The `set_property SNAPPING_MODE ON` command is used for `pblock_CL_mid` and `pblock_CL_bot`, which may help align the pblocks to specific grid boundaries within the FPGA.

6. **Selective Cell Reassignment**: Some cells are reassigned to the parent pblock `pblock_CL` for better quality of results (QoR). This is done using the `add_cells_to_pblock` command with specific cell lists.

7. **Commented Out Sections**: The script contains several commented-out sections, indicating potential configurations or constraints that are not currently active. These include additional pblock definitions, clock group settings, and placement exclusions.

This script is crucial for developers working on FPGA designs, as it defines how the logic is physically organized and constrained within the FPGA, impacting performance and resource utilization.
