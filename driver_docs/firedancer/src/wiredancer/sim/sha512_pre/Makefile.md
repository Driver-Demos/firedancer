Makefile for simulating the `sha512_pre` module using Verilog sources and Cocotb.

# Purpose
The `Makefile` is used to automate the build process for a simulation environment. It defines several variables and paths necessary for compiling and simulating Verilog code. The `SIM` variable specifies the simulator to use, defaulting to `questa`, while `MODULE` and `TOPLEVEL` define the test module and top-level module, respectively. The `VERILOG_SOURCES` variable lists the source files required for the simulation, including files from the Xilinx Vivado library and custom RTL files located in the `RTL_DIR`. The file also includes additional makefile configurations from `cocotb-config`, which are necessary for integrating with the cocotb testing framework.
