Makefile for compiling and simulating Verilog sources with Questa and Cocotb in a specific directory.

# Purpose
The `Makefile` is used to automate the build process for a simulation environment. It defines several variables and paths necessary for compiling and simulating Verilog and SystemVerilog source files. The `SIM` variable specifies the simulator to use, defaulting to `questa`, while `MODULE` and `TOPLEVEL` define the test module and top-level module, respectively. The `VERILOG_SOURCES` variable lists all the source files required for the simulation, including files from the Xilinx Vivado library and custom RTL files located in the `RTL_DIR` and `SIM_DIR` directories. The `COMPILE_ARGS` variable includes additional compilation arguments, such as the path to the instruction ROM memory initialization file. The `Makefile` also includes a reference to a simulation makefile provided by `cocotb`, which is a coroutine-based co-simulation library for writing testbenches in Python.
