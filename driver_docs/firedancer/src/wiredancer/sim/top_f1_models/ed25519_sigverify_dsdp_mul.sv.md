Implements a module for ED25519 signature verification using DSDP multiplication in SystemVerilog.

# Purpose
The `ed25519_sigverify_dsdp_mul` module is part of a digital signature verification system using the Ed25519 algorithm. This module focuses on the scalar multiplication and addition operations required for signature verification. It takes several 256-bit input signals representing elliptic curve points and scalars, such as `i_Ax`, `i_Ay`, `i_Az`, `i_At`, and their corresponding `i_ApGx`, `i_ApGy`, `i_ApGz`, `i_ApGt` for the point addition with a generator point `G`. The module also processes scalar inputs `i_As` and `i_Gs` for the signature and generator, respectively.

The module outputs include 256-bit signals `o_Cx`, `o_Cy`, `o_Cz`, and `o_Ct`, which represent the result of the elliptic curve operations. It also provides a validity output `o_v` and a processed message output `o_m`. The parameters such as `MUL_T`, `MUL_D`, `ADD_D`, and `PIPE_D` define the configuration for multiplication, addition, and pipeline depth, which are crucial for the timing and performance of the operations. The module operates synchronously with the `clk` and can be reset using the `rst` signal. This module is a specialized component within a broader cryptographic verification system, focusing on the mathematical operations necessary for verifying digital signatures.
