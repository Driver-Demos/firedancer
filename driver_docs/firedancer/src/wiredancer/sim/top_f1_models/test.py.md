A cocotb-based test for simulating and verifying PCIe transactions and ED25519 signature operations.

# Purpose
The code is a test suite for a hardware design verification process using the `cocotb` framework. It defines an asynchronous test function [`test`](<#test>) that interacts with a device under test (DUT) to verify its behavior. The test initializes various control signals of the DUT and sets up multiple clock signals using the `cocotb.clock.Clock` class. It also uses the `wd_cocotil` module to start several monitoring and modeling tasks that observe and simulate different components of the DUT, such as PCIe transactions, SHA processing, and Ed25519 signature verification.

The test suite generates random data and simulates different scenarios to test the DUT's response. It uses the `ref_ed25519` module to create public keys and signatures, and the `pcap` module to read packet capture files for input data. The test introduces random errors in the data to test the DUT's error handling capabilities. The test suite collects and processes transaction data, which it stores in various queues and dictionaries for further analysis. The code is intended to be run as part of a larger verification process, and it does not define public APIs or external interfaces.

[View Source →](<../../../../../../src/wiredancer/sim/top_f1_models/test.py#L14>)

Executes a testbench for a hardware design using cocotb, simulating various components and monitoring their interactions.
- **Decorators**: `@cocotb.test`
- **Inputs**:
    - `dut`: The device under test, representing the hardware design to simulate.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Initialize control signals and set default values for the device under test (DUT).
    - Create empty lists and dictionaries to store transaction data for different components.
    - Start clock signals and reset sequences for the DUT using cocotb's asynchronous start function.
    - Monitor various components of the DUT using custom monitoring functions from the `wd_cocotil` module.
    - Simulate the behavior of the DUT by iterating over a range of transactions, introducing random delays and errors.
    - Generate random transactions and manipulate them based on error conditions.
    - Append transactions to the respective queues for further processing and monitoring.
    - Write transaction data to the DUT using a custom write function.
    - Wait for the completion of all transactions by monitoring the output queue.
- **Output**: No explicit return value; the function performs simulation and monitoring tasks as part of a testbench.
