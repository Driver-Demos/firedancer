Makefile for simulating the `ed25519_point_add` module using Verilog sources and Cocotb.

# Purpose
The `Makefile` is used to automate the build process for a simulation environment. It specifies the simulator to use with the `SIM` variable, defaulting to `questa`, and sets the module name with the `MODULE` variable. The `RTL_DIR` variable defines the directory path for the RTL (Register Transfer Level) source files, and `TOPLEVEL` specifies the top-level module for the simulation, which is `ed25519_point_add`. The `VERILOG_SOURCES` variable lists all the Verilog and SystemVerilog source files required for the simulation, including files from the Xilinx Vivado library and custom RTL files. The `Makefile` also includes additional makefile configurations from `cocotb-config`, which are necessary for running the simulation with the Cocotb framework.
