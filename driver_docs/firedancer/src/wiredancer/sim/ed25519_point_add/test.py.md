A cocotb-based test for verifying the ED25519 point addition implementation in a hardware design.

# Purpose
The code is a test suite for verifying the functionality of a digital design using the Cocotb framework. It tests a hardware design under test (DUT) by simulating clock signals and reset conditions. The test involves generating random elliptic curve points and performing point addition using the `ref_ed25519` module, which implements operations on the Ed25519 elliptic curve. The test checks if the DUT correctly computes the addition of two elliptic curve points and compares the results with expected values.

The test initializes a clock and a reset signal for the DUT, then iterates over a loop to perform multiple test cycles. In each cycle, it generates random inputs, applies them to the DUT, and waits for the DUT to produce outputs. The outputs are then compared against expected results calculated using the reference Ed25519 implementation. The test logs the results and asserts that the DUT's outputs match the expected values, ensuring the correctness of the DUT's implementation of elliptic curve point addition.

Executes a test for a digital circuit using cocotb, simulating clock cycles and verifying point addition on elliptic curves.
- **Decorators**: `@cocotb.test`
- **Inputs**:
    - `dut`: The device under test, which is a digital circuit model.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Initialize the clock signal for the device under test (DUT) and start it with a 1 ns period.
    - Toggle the reset signal of the DUT for 32 cycles with active high configuration.
    - Wait for 1024 rising edges of the clock to ensure the DUT is stable.
    - Initialize variables `W_M`, `es`, and `D` for use in the test loop.
    - For 1024 iterations, generate a random integer `m_i` and select random points `P0` and `P1` on the elliptic curve.
    - Compute the point addition `P2` of `P0` and `P1` and store the result with `m_i` in the list `es`.
    - Convert the coordinates of `P0` and `P1` into `BinaryValue` objects and assign them to the DUT inputs.
    - Set the DUT input `m_i` with a bitwise operation to include the random integer `m_i`.
    - Wait for a rising edge of the clock and check the output `m_o` of the DUT.
    - If the first bit of `m_o` is not '1', increment `D` and continue the loop if `D` is less than 100.
    - Pop the first element from `es` to get the expected point `P2` and integer `m_i`.
    - Retrieve the output coordinates from the DUT and compare them with the expected values, logging the results.
    - Assert that the DUT outputs match the expected point coordinates and integer value.
- **Output**: No explicit return value; the function logs information and uses assertions to verify the DUT behavior.
