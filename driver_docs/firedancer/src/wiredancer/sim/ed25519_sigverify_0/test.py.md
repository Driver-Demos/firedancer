Cocotb test for simulating and verifying the ED25519 signature verification module.

# Purpose
This code is a test suite for a digital design verification environment using the Cocotb framework. It is designed to test a hardware module, referred to as `dut` (Device Under Test), by simulating its behavior and verifying its functionality. The test initializes several input signals of the `dut`, such as `i_v`, `i_m`, `o_r`, and `max_pending`, and then starts a clock signal using the `Clock` class from Cocotb. It also uses functions from the `wd_cocotil` module to toggle reset signals, introduce random toggles, and monitor specific signals related to the `ed25519` signature verification process.

The test involves generating random transactions and feeding them into the `dut` while monitoring the output. It uses the `BinaryValue` class to create binary representations of various input signals, such as `i_m`, `i_pub`, `i_sig_l`, `i_sig_h`, and `i_h`, which are then assigned to the `dut` inputs. The test includes mechanisms to handle backpressure by waiting for specific conditions on the `dut` signals before proceeding. The test suite is structured to run asynchronously, leveraging Cocotb's coroutine-based approach to simulate the hardware behavior over time.

Executes a test for a digital unit under test (DUT) by simulating clock cycles, toggling signals, and verifying signature operations.
- **Decorators**: `@cocotb.test`
- **Inputs**:
    - `dut`: The device under test (DUT) which is a digital circuit or module to be tested.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Initialize DUT input signals `i_v`, `i_m`, `o_r`, and `max_pending` to specific values.
    - Create an empty dictionary `q_o_ed25519_sigverify_0` to store transaction data.
    - Start a clock on `dut.clk` with a period of 1 nanosecond.
    - Start asynchronous tasks to toggle reset, randomly toggle `o_r`, and monitor the signature verification process.
    - Wait for 1024 rising edges of the clock to simulate a post-reset condition.
    - Retrieve the width of the message `W_M` from the DUT and generate a random transaction ID `tid`.
    - Iterate four times to simulate transactions:
    -   - Wait for backpressure conditions to clear before proceeding.
    -   - Introduce random gaps by setting `i_v` to 0 based on a random condition.
    -   - Increment the transaction ID `tid`.
    -   - Generate a random transaction `tr` and store it in `q_o_ed25519_sigverify_0`.
    -   - Create binary values for message, public key, signature parts, and hash, and assign them to DUT inputs.
    -   - Set `i_v` to 1 and assign the transaction ID to `i_t`.
    -   - Wait for a rising edge of the clock after setting inputs.
    - After the loop, wait for backpressure conditions to clear and set `i_v` to 0.
    - Continue waiting for rising edges of the clock until all transactions in `q_o_ed25519_sigverify_0` are processed.
- **Output**: No explicit output is returned; the function performs operations on the DUT and simulates its behavior.
