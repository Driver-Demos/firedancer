Makefile for simulating and verifying the `ed25519_sigverify_0` module using Verilog sources.

# Purpose
The `Makefile` is used to automate the build process for a simulation environment. It defines several variables and paths necessary for compiling and simulating Verilog source files. The `SIM` variable specifies the simulator to use, defaulting to `questa`, while `MODULE` and `TOPLEVEL` define the test module and top-level module name, respectively. The `VERILOG_SOURCES` variable lists all the Verilog source files required for the simulation, including files from the Xilinx Vivado library and custom RTL files located in the `RTL_DIR`. The `COMPILE_ARGS` variable includes additional compilation arguments, such as the path to the instruction ROM memory initialization file. The file concludes by including a makefile from the `cocotb` configuration to integrate with the `cocotb` testing framework.
