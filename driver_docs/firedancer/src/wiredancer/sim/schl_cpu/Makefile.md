Makefile for simulating Verilog sources with Questa and Cocotb in the Firedancer project.

# Purpose
The `Makefile` is used to automate the build process for a hardware simulation project. It defines several variables and paths necessary for the simulation, such as `SIM`, which specifies the simulator to use, and `MODULE`, which indicates the test module. The `RTL_DIR` variable points to the directory containing the RTL (Register Transfer Level) source files. The `TOPLEVEL` variable specifies the top-level module for the simulation, and `TOPLEVEL_LANG` sets the language to Verilog. The `VERILOG_SOURCES` variable lists all the Verilog and SystemVerilog source files required for the simulation, including files from the Xilinx Vivado library and custom RTL files. The `COMPILE_ARGS` variable includes additional compilation arguments, such as the path to the instruction ROM MIF file. The file concludes by including a makefile from the `cocotb` configuration to integrate with the `cocotb` testing framework.
