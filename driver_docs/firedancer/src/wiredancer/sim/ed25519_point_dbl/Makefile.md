Makefile for simulating the `ed25519_point_dbl` module using Verilog sources and Cocotb.

# Purpose
The `Makefile` is used to automate the build process for a simulation environment. It specifies the simulator to use with the `SIM` variable, defaulting to `questa` if not set. The `MODULE` variable defines the test module, while `TOPLEVEL` specifies the top-level module for simulation, which is `ed25519_point_dbl`. The `VERILOG_SOURCES` variable lists the Verilog and SystemVerilog source files required for the simulation, including files from the Xilinx Vivado library and custom RTL files located in the `RTL_DIR`. The file also includes additional makefile configurations from `cocotb-config`, which are necessary for integrating the CoCoTB testing framework into the simulation process.
