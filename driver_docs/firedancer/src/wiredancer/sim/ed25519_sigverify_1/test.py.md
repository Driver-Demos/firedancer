A cocotb-based test for the ed25519 signature verification module with random input generation.

# Purpose
The code is a test suite for a digital design verification environment using the Cocotb framework. It defines an asynchronous test function [`test`](<#test>) that interacts with a device under test (DUT) to verify its behavior. The test initializes several input signals of the DUT, such as `i_v`, `i_m`, and `o_r`, and sets up a clock signal using the `Clock` class from Cocotb. It also uses utility functions from the `wd_cocotil` module to toggle reset signals and perform random signal toggling, which helps simulate various operating conditions.

The test function generates random transactions and assigns them to the DUT's input signals. It uses the `BinaryValue` class to create binary representations of the input data, which are then assigned to the DUT's inputs. The test includes mechanisms to handle backpressure by waiting for the DUT to be ready to accept new data. The test also maintains a dictionary `q_o_ed25519_sigverify_1` to track transactions by their transaction IDs (`tid`). The test runs for a specified number of cycles, ensuring that the DUT processes the input data correctly and that the expected behavior is observed.

Executes a testbench for a digital design using the cocotb framework, simulating signal interactions and monitoring outputs.
- **Decorators**: `@cocotb.test`
- **Inputs**:
    - `dut`: The device under test (DUT) which is a digital design module to be simulated.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Initialize DUT input signals `i_v`, `i_m`, `o_r`, and `max_pending` to specific values.
    - Create an empty dictionary `q_o_ed25519_sigverify_1` to store transaction data.
    - Start the clock and various asynchronous processes using `cocotb.start()` to simulate reset toggling, random signal toggling, and monitoring.
    - Wait for 1024 clock cycles to allow for post-reset stabilization.
    - Retrieve the width of the message `W_M` from the DUT and generate a random transaction ID `tid`.
    - Iterate four times to simulate transactions, checking for backpressure and introducing random gaps between transactions.
    - In each iteration, increment `tid`, generate a random transaction, and store it in `q_o_ed25519_sigverify_1`.
    - Create binary values for various signals with specified bit widths and assign them to the DUT inputs.
    - Set `i_v` to 1 to indicate valid input and wait for a rising edge of the clock.
    - After the loop, ensure no backpressure by waiting for `i_r` to be asserted before setting `i_v` to 0.
    - Continue waiting for rising edges of the clock until all transactions in `q_o_ed25519_sigverify_1` are processed.
- **Output**: No explicit return value; the function operates asynchronously to simulate and test the DUT.
