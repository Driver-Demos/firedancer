Makefile for simulating the `sha512_modq_meta` module using Verilog sources with Questa.

# Purpose
The `Makefile` is used to automate the build process for a simulation environment. It specifies the simulator to use with the `SIM` variable, defaulting to `questa`, and sets the module name with `MODULE`. The `RTL_DIR` variable defines the directory path for RTL (Register Transfer Level) source files, and `TOPLEVEL` specifies the top-level module for the simulation. The `VERILOG_SOURCES` variable lists all the Verilog and SystemVerilog source files required for the simulation, including files from the Xilinx Vivado library and custom RTL files. The file concludes by including additional makefile configurations from `cocotb`, a coroutine-based co-simulation library for testing VHDL and Verilog.
