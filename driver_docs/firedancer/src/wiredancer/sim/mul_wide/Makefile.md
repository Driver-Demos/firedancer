Makefile for simulating Verilog modules with Questa and Cocotb in the mul_wide directory.

# Purpose
The `Makefile` is used to automate the build process for a simulation environment. It sets default values for simulation tools and parameters, such as `SIM` for the simulator and `TOPLEVEL_LANG` for the language, which defaults to Verilog. The file specifies the module to test (`MODULE`), the top-level module (`TOPLEVEL`), and the directory for RTL files (`RTL_DIR`). It also defines the simulation arguments (`SIM_ARGS`) and lists the Verilog source files required for the simulation, including files from the Xilinx Vivado library and custom RTL files. The `Makefile` includes additional makefile configurations from `cocotb-config` to integrate with the cocotb testing framework.
