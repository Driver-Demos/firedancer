Functions and tests for replaying pcap streams, monitoring AWS-F1 performance, and building Wiredancer.


## Files
- **[fd_replay_loop.c](fd_replay_loop.c.md)**: Implements functions for replaying pcap file streams with flow control and diagnostic logging.
- **[fd_replay_loop.h](fd_replay_loop.h.md)**: Header file for replaying data from a pcap file into a tango fragment stream with flow control diagnostics.
- **[Local.mk](Local.mk.md)**: Makefile for building and testing the Wiredancer component with specific headers and objects.
- **[test_wiredancer_demo.c](test_wiredancer_demo.c.md)**: A unit test for the Wiredancer system, designed to run on AWS-F1, comparing Wiredancer's performance against x86 by replaying network packets and verifying transactions.
- **[wd_f1_mon.c](wd_f1_mon.c.md)**: Monitors and displays performance metrics for AWS-F1 FPGA and x86 systems using ASCII charts.
- **[wd_f1_mon.h](wd_f1_mon.h.md)**: Defines a monitoring state structure and functions for thread management and TSC calibration.
