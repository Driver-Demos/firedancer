Makefile for building and testing the Wiredancer component with specific headers and objects.

# Purpose
The `Makefile` content defines build instructions for a software component when the `FD_HAS_WIREDANCER` condition is true. It specifies the creation of a library named `fd_wiredancer_test` and includes headers `wd_f1_mon.h` and `fd_replay_loop.h`. It also adds object files `fd_replay_loop` and `wd_f1_mon` to the build process. Additionally, it sets up a unit test named `test_wiredancer_demo` that depends on several components, including `fd_wiredancer`, `fd_ballet`, `fd_disco`, `fd_tango`, and `fd_util`.
