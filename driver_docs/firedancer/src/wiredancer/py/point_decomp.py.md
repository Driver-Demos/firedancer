Implements a function for decomposing elliptic curve points using the Ed25519 curve.

# Purpose
The code is a Python script that performs operations related to the Ed25519 elliptic curve, which is commonly used in cryptographic applications. The script imports several functions and constants from two modules, `ref_ed25519` and `ed25519_lib`, which are likely to contain implementations of mathematical operations and constants specific to the Ed25519 curve. The primary function defined in the script is [`kpoint_decomp`](<#kpoint_decomp>), which takes parameters `y`, `d`, `p`, and `ERR` and performs a series of modular arithmetic operations to compute a value `r`. This function is likely used to decompose a point on the Ed25519 curve.

The script also includes a main execution block that generates random hexadecimal strings, converts them to bytes, and attempts to decompress them into points on the Ed25519 curve using the `point_decompress` function. It then compares the result of the [`kpoint_decomp`](<#kpoint_decomp>) function with the decompressed point to verify correctness. The script appears to be a test or demonstration of the [`kpoint_decomp`](<#kpoint_decomp>) function's ability to handle random inputs and verify the integrity of point decompression on the Ed25519 curve. The script writes hexadecimal constants and instructions to files if a certain condition is met, which suggests it may also be used for generating test data or debugging information.

# Global Variables

---
### PM1
- **Type**: `int`
- **Description**: `PM1` is an integer variable that represents the value of `p` minus 1, where `p` is a constant imported from the `ref_ed25519` module. This variable is used in mathematical operations related to elliptic curve computations.
- **Use**: Used in the `kpoint_decomp` function to perform modular arithmetic operations.

### kpoint\_decomp<!-- {{#callable:firedancer/src/wiredancer/py/point_decomp.kpoint_decomp}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/wiredancer/py/point_decomp.py#L17>)

Performs a mathematical decomposition of a point using modular arithmetic and returns a result based on specific conditions.
- **Inputs**:
    - `y`: An integer representing the input value to decompose.
    - `d`: A constant used in the modular multiplication.
    - `p`: A prime number used as the modulus in calculations.
    - `ERR`: An error value to return under certain conditions.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Extracts the sign bit from `y` and masks `y` to 255 bits.
    - Calculates `yy` using modular multiplication and exponentiation, adjusting based on a condition with `PM1`.
    - Calculates `x2` using modular multiplication, adjusting based on whether `x2` is zero, and further modifies it with `yy`.
    - Computes `x` using modular exponentiation and adjusts `x` based on conditions involving `xx`, `xp`, and the sign bit.
    - Evaluates several boolean conditions (`x2z`, `sz`, `snz`, `x2zsz`, `x2zsnz`) to determine the final result `r`.
    - Uses ternary operations to set `r` based on conditions involving `xx`, `x2`, `x2zsz`, `x2zsnz`, and whether `y` is greater than or equal to `p`.
- **Output**: Returns an integer result `r` based on the decomposition and conditions evaluated.
