Implements functions for verifying Ed25519 signatures using various mathematical operations and checks.

# Purpose
The code is a Python script that implements and tests cryptographic signature verification using the Ed25519 algorithm. It imports several functions and constants from modules such as `ref_ed25519`, `ed25519_lib`, `point_decomp`, and `point_mul`, which are used to perform mathematical operations related to elliptic curve cryptography. The script defines several functions, including [`kpoint_equal`](<#kpoint_equal>), [`ksigverify`](<#ksigverify>), [`ksigverify2`](<#ksigverify2>), [`ksigverify_split0`](<#ksigverify_split0>), and [`ksigverify_split1`](<#ksigverify_split1>), which are responsible for verifying signatures by performing operations like point decomposition, point addition, and modular arithmetic.

The script also includes a main execution block that generates random secret keys, public keys, and messages to create and verify signatures. It uses the `ref_ed25519` module to generate public keys and signatures, and then verifies these signatures using the defined functions. The script outputs hexadecimal representations of the inputs and results, and it compares the verification results from the custom implementation with those from the `ref_ed25519` library to ensure correctness. The script is designed to be executed as a standalone program, and it includes error simulation to test the robustness of the signature verification process.
