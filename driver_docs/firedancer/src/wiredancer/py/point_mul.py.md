Implements elliptic curve point multiplication and addition using the Ed25519 curve.

# Purpose
The code is a Python script that performs operations related to elliptic curve cryptography using the Ed25519 curve. It imports functions and constants from two modules, `ref_ed25519` and `ed25519_lib`, which provide mathematical operations and cryptographic utilities. The script defines two main functions: [`kpoint_add`](<#kpoint_add>) and [`kpoint_mul`](<#kpoint_mul>). The [`kpoint_add`](<#kpoint_add>) function computes the addition of two points on the elliptic curve, while the [`kpoint_mul`](<#kpoint_mul>) function performs scalar multiplication of a point on the curve. These functions use modular arithmetic operations to ensure calculations remain within the finite field defined by the curve's parameters.

The script also includes a main execution block that tests the elliptic curve operations. It generates random hexadecimal strings to create secret keys, converts them to public keys using the `ref_ed25519` module, and performs point decompression and multiplication. The results of these operations are compared to ensure correctness. The script uses the `Expr` class from `ed25519_lib` to manage expressions and trace computations, which helps in debugging and verifying the cryptographic operations. The script is intended to be run as a standalone program, as indicated by the `if __name__ == '__main__':` block, and it does not define any public APIs or external interfaces for use in other modules.

### kpoint\_mul<!-- {{#callable:firedancer/src/wiredancer/py/point_mul.kpoint_mul}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../src/wiredancer/py/point_mul.py#L54>)

Performs scalar multiplication of a point on an elliptic curve using a given scalar, curve parameter, and prime modulus.
- **Inputs**:
    - `P`: A tuple representing a point on the elliptic curve, consisting of four [`Expr`](<ed25519_lib.py.md#expr>) objects.
    - `s`: An integer scalar used for multiplication.
    - `d`: A curve parameter used in the elliptic curve equation.
    - `p`: A prime modulus used for calculations on the elliptic curve.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Initialize `Q` as the neutral element of the elliptic curve.
    - Iterate 256 times, corresponding to the bit length of the scalar `s`.
    - In each iteration, determine the least significant bit of `s` and shift `s` right by one bit.
    - Compute `Q2` by adding `Q` and `P` using the [`kpoint_add`](<#kpoint_add>) function.
    - Double the point `P` by adding it to itself using the [`kpoint_add`](<#kpoint_add>) function.
    - Use the [`ternary`](<ed25519_lib.py.md#ternary>) function to conditionally select components from `Q2` or `Q` based on the bit value `a`.
    - Update `Q` with the selected components `(x, y, z, t)`.
    - Return the final value of `Q` after completing all iterations.
