Implements a Verilog module for Ed25519 signature verification using double-scalar multiplication.

# Purpose
The `ed25519_sigverify_dsdp_mul` module is a hardware description for performing operations related to the Ed25519 digital signature algorithm. This module focuses on point multiplication and addition on the elliptic curve used in Ed25519, which is a widely used cryptographic algorithm for digital signatures. The module takes several 256-bit inputs representing elliptic curve points and scalars, and it outputs the results of these operations. The module uses parameters such as `MUL_T`, `MUL_D`, `ADD_D`, and `PIPE_D` to configure the multiplication and addition processes, which are essential for the cryptographic computations.

The module includes several key components, such as a dual-port RAM for storing intermediate results and two instances of the `ed25519_point_add` module for performing point addition and doubling operations. The module operates in a pipelined manner, with multiple stages (`c_0_m`, `c_1_m`, `c_2_m`, `c_a_m`, and `po_m`) to manage the flow of data through the computation process. The use of `always_comb` and `always_ff` blocks ensures that the module processes inputs and updates outputs synchronously with the clock signal. The module also includes a display statement for debugging purposes, which outputs the state of various signals during operation.
