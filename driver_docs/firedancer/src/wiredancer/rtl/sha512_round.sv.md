Implements a SHA-512 round module in SystemVerilog for cryptographic hash computation.

# Purpose
The `sha512_round` module implements a single round of the SHA-512 cryptographic hash function. It processes a 512-bit input hash value (`i_hash`), a 64-bit input word (`i_word`), and a 64-bit constant value (`i_cval`) to produce a 512-bit output hash (`o_hash`). The module operates synchronously with a clock (`clk`) and reset (`rst`) signal. The design enforces specific bit-widths for the hash and word inputs through assertions, ensuring they match the expected sizes for SHA-512.

The module uses several internal logic signals to perform the SHA-512 round operations, including bitwise operations and rotations. It calculates intermediate values such as `ma`, `ch`, `ea`, and `ee`, which are used in the SHA-512 algorithm to update the hash state. The `shift_adder_6` submodule is instantiated to perform a series of additions required in the round computation. The final output hash is constructed by combining the results of these operations, ensuring the correct transformation of the input hash state according to the SHA-512 specification.

### sha512\_round
Implements a single round of the SHA-512 hash algorithm. Processes input hash, word, and constant values to produce an updated hash output.
- **Constants**:
    - ``HASH_W``: Defines the width of the hash, set to 512 bits.
    - ``WORD_W``: Defines the width of a word, set to 64 bits.
    - ``CYCLES_ROUND``: Specifies the number of cycles per round, set to 1.
- **Ports**:
    - ``i_hash``: Input hash value of width `HASH_W`.
    - ``i_word``: Input word value of width `WORD_W`.
    - ``i_cval``: Input constant value of width `WORD_W`.
    - ``o_hash``: Output hash value of width `HASH_W`.
    - ``clk``: Clock signal input.
    - ``rst``: Reset signal input.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Uses `always_comb` block to compute intermediate values `ma`, `ch`, `ea`, `ee`, `s0`, `s1`, and `s2` based on input values.
    - Assigns `w` and `k` to `i_word` and `i_cval` respectively, and decomposes `i_hash` into `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, `h`.
    - Calculates `ma` as the majority function of `a`, `b`, and `c`, and `ch` as the choice function of `e`, `f`, and `g`.
    - Computes `ea` and `ee` as rotated XORs of `a` and `e` respectively, and `s0` as the sum of `ea` and `ma`.
    - Instantiates `shift_adder_6` module to compute `s6` from `ch`, `h`, `ee`, `w`, and `k`.
    - Uses `always_ff` block to update `o_hash` with the new hash value on the rising edge of `clk`.
