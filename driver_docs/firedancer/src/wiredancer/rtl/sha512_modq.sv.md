Implements a SHA-512 module with modular reduction for cryptographic operations in Verilog.

# Purpose
The `sha512_modq` module implements a SHA-512 hashing operation followed by a modular reduction operation. The module processes input data blocks and outputs a hash value that is reduced modulo a predefined constant, `ED25519_Q`. The module uses two submodules: `sha512_sch` and `sha512_block`. The `sha512_sch` submodule handles the scheduling of input data blocks, while the `sha512_block` submodule performs the actual SHA-512 hashing. The module also includes a series of wide multipliers (`mul_wide` instances) to perform arithmetic operations necessary for the modular reduction.

The module's inputs include a valid signal (`i_v`), a first block indicator (`i_f`), the number of blocks (`i_c`), the data to be hashed (`i_d`), and a transaction ID (`i_t`). The outputs are a valid signal (`o_v`), a transaction ID (`o_t`), and the reduced hash value (`o_d`). The module operates synchronously with a clock (`clk`) and reset (`rst`) signal. The internal logic performs arithmetic operations to compute the modular reduction, ensuring that the final output is within the range defined by `ED25519_Q`. The design is structured to handle data in a pipelined manner, allowing for efficient processing of multiple data blocks.
# Modules

---
### sha512\_modq
Implements a SHA-512 hashing operation followed by a modular reduction using a constant `ED25519_Q`. The module processes input data blocks and outputs a reduced hash value.
- **Constants**:
    - ``META_W``: Defines the width of the transaction ID, set to 64 bits.
    - ``ED25519_Q``: A 253-bit constant used for modular reduction, representing a specific large prime number.
    - ``ED25519_L0``: A 125-bit constant used in calculations, representing a specific large number.
- **Ports**:
    - ``i_v``: Indicates if the input data is valid.
    - ``i_f``: Indicates if the current block is the first block.
    - ``i_c``: Specifies the number of blocks.
    - ``i_d``: Carries the input data to be processed.
    - ``i_t``: Carries the transaction ID.
    - ``i_p``: Indicates backpressure, applied only for the first block.
    - ``o_v``: Indicates if the output data is valid.
    - ``o_t``: Carries the output transaction ID.
    - ``o_d``: Carries the output data after processing.
    - ``clk``: The clock signal for synchronization.
    - ``rst``: The reset signal to initialize the module.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Uses `sha512_sch` and `sha512_block` submodules to perform SHA-512 hashing on input data.
    - The `mul_wide` instances perform wide multiplication operations on intermediate data.
    - An `always_ff` block updates intermediate results and performs modular reduction using `ED25519_Q`.
    - An `always_comb` block rearranges the output hash data and prepares it for further processing.
    - The final output data is assigned after modular reduction, ensuring it is within the desired range.
