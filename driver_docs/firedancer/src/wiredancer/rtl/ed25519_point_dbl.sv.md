Implements the ED25519 point doubling operation using modular arithmetic in Verilog.

# Purpose
The Verilog code defines a module named `ed25519_point_dbl`, which performs point doubling operations on elliptic curve points in the context of the Ed25519 cryptographic algorithm. The module takes four 255-bit input signals representing the coordinates of a point on the curve (`in0_x`, `in0_y`, `in0_z`, `in0_t`) and produces four 255-bit output signals (`out0_x`, `out0_y`, `out0_z`, `out0_t`) representing the doubled point. The module also includes an input and output for a multi-bit signal (`m_i` and `m_o`) used for additional data processing.

The module uses several macros (`ADD`, `SUB`, `MUL`, `PIP`) to perform modular arithmetic operations and pipeline data through the design. These macros instantiate parameterized submodules for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and pipelining, which are essential for the arithmetic operations required in elliptic curve computations. The design maintains a hierarchical structure, as indicated by the `keep_hierarchy` attribute, ensuring that the module's internal structure is preserved during synthesis. The code is part of a broader cryptographic library, as suggested by the import statement `import wd_sigverify::*`, which likely provides additional cryptographic functions and constants, such as `ED25519_2D`, used in the module.

### ed25519\_point\_dbl
Performs point doubling on elliptic curve points using the Ed25519 curve. Utilizes modular arithmetic operations and pipelining to compute the new point coordinates.
- **Constants**:
    - ``T``: A 32-bit constant used in modular arithmetic operations.
    - ``D_M``: A constant that defines a depth parameter for pipelining.
    - ``D_A``: A constant that defines an additional depth parameter for pipelining.
    - ``D_S``: A constant that defines a subtraction depth parameter for pipelining.
    - ``CT``: A 4-bit constant extracted from `T` for control purposes.
    - ``ST``: A shifted version of `T` used in operations.
    - ``R_I``: A constant initialized to 0, possibly used for reset or initial state.
    - ``M``: A constant defining the bit-width of the modular input and output.
- **Ports**:
    - ``clk``: Clock signal for synchronous operations.
    - ``rst``: Reset signal to initialize the module.
    - ``in0_x``: Input X-coordinate of the point to double.
    - ``in0_y``: Input Y-coordinate of the point to double.
    - ``in0_z``: Input Z-coordinate of the point to double.
    - ``in0_t``: Input T-coordinate of the point to double.
    - ``out0_x``: Output X-coordinate after doubling.
    - ``out0_y``: Output Y-coordinate after doubling.
    - ``out0_z``: Output Z-coordinate after doubling.
    - ``out0_t``: Output T-coordinate after doubling.
    - ``m_i``: Modular input for pipelining.
    - ``m_o``: Modular output after pipelining.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Uses `SUB`, `ADD`, `MUL`, and `PIP` macros to perform modular arithmetic and pipelining operations.
    - Calculates intermediate values such as `R1_s`, `R3_a`, `R5_sm`, `R6_am`, `R7_m`, `R8_m`, and `R9_mm` using modular subtraction, addition, and multiplication.
    - Pipelines intermediate results using `PIP` macro to manage data flow and timing.
    - Computes final output coordinates `out0_x`, `out0_y`, `out0_z`, and `out0_t` using modular multiplication of pipelined results.
    - Processes modular input `m_i` through a pipelined operation to produce `m_o`.
