Implements an ED25519 point addition module using modular arithmetic operations in SystemVerilog.

# Purpose
The `ed25519_point_add` module implements point addition for the Ed25519 elliptic curve, which is commonly used in cryptographic applications. This module takes two points on the curve, represented by their coordinates (`in0_x`, `in0_y`, `in0_z`, `in0_t` and `in1_x`, `in1_y`, `in1_z`, `in1_t`), and computes their sum, outputting the resulting point's coordinates (`out0_x`, `out0_y`, `out0_z`, `out0_t`). The module uses modular arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, and multiplication, which are defined using macros (`ADD`, `SUB`, `MUL`) for operations over a 255-bit field. The module also employs pipelining (`PIP`) to manage data flow and improve performance.

The module is parameterized with several constants, such as `T`, `D_M`, `D_A`, `D_S`, and `M`, which control various aspects of the computation, including timing and data width. The use of pipelining and modular arithmetic operations suggests that the module is designed for efficient hardware implementation, likely targeting FPGA or ASIC platforms. The `ed25519_point_add` module is a specialized component that fits into a larger cryptographic system, providing the specific functionality of point addition on the Ed25519 curve.
# Modules

### ed25519\_point\_add
Performs point addition on the Ed25519 elliptic curve using modular arithmetic operations. The module takes two input points and produces an output point as a result of the addition.
- **Constants**:
    - ``T``: A 32-bit constant used in the module, with a default value of `32'h007F_CCC2`.
    - ``D_M``: A constant parameter with a value of 15, used in pipelining operations.
    - ``D_A``: A constant parameter with a value of 4, used in pipelining operations.
    - ``D_S``: A constant parameter with a value of 2, used in pipelining operations.
    - ``CT``: A 4-bit slice of `T`, used in the module.
    - ``ST``: A shifted version of `T`, used in the module.
    - ``R_I``: A constant parameter with a value of 0, used in the module.
    - ``M``: A constant parameter with a value of 128, used for the width of certain input and output ports.
- **Ports**:
    - ``clk``: Clock signal input for synchronization.
    - ``rst``: Reset signal input to initialize the module.

    - ``in0_t``: T-coordinate of the first input point.
    - ``in1_x``: X-coordinate of the second input point.
    - ``in1_y``: Y-coordinate of the second input point.
    - ``in1_z``: Z-coordinate of the second input point.
    - ``in1_t``: T-coordinate of the second input point.
    - ``out0_x``: X-coordinate of the output point.
    - ``out0_y``: Y-coordinate of the output point.
    - ``out0_z``: Z-coordinate of the output point.
    - ``out0_t``: T-coordinate of the output point.
    - ``m_i``: Input mask of width `M`.
    - ``m_o``: Output mask of width `M`.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Defines intermediate logic variables for storing results of arithmetic operations.
    - Uses macros `ADD`, `SUB`, `MUL`, and `PIP` to perform modular addition, subtraction, multiplication, and pipelining respectively.
    - Calculates intermediate results such as `R1_s`, `R2_s`, `R3_a`, `R4_a` using subtraction and addition of input coordinates.
    - Performs multiplication on intermediate results to compute `R5_sm`, `R6_am`, `R7_m`, `R8_m`, and `R9_mm`.
    - Applies pipelining to intermediate results using the `PIP` macro to manage data flow and timing.
    - Computes final output coordinates `out0_x`, `out0_y`, `out0_z`, and `out0_t` using modular multiplication of pipelined results.
    - Processes the input mask `m_i` through pipelining to produce the output mask `m_o`.
