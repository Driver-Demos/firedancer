Implements a key store module with FIFO and dual-port RAM for data storage and retrieval.

# Purpose
The `key_store` module is a hardware design component that manages the storage and retrieval of data using a key-based system. It is parameterized by `D`, the depth of the storage, and `W`, the width of the data, allowing for flexible configuration. The module interfaces with external components through input and output ports for data (`i_d`, `o_d`), control signals (`i_v`, `o_r`), and keys (`i_k`, `o_k`). It uses a FIFO (First-In-First-Out) mechanism to manage the availability of storage space and a dual-port RAM to store and retrieve data based on keys.

The module includes a state machine that initializes and manages the FIFO index, ensuring that the storage system is ready for operation. The `showahead_fifo` instance handles the indexing of available storage slots, while the `simple_dual_port_ram` instance manages the actual data storage and retrieval. The module operates synchronously with a clock signal (`clk`) and can be reset using a reset signal (`rst`). The design ensures that data can be pushed into storage when space is available and retrieved using the corresponding keys, facilitating efficient data management in hardware systems.
# Modules

---
### key\_store
Implements a key-value store using a FIFO and dual-port RAM. Manages data storage and retrieval based on input keys and control signals.
- **Constants**:
    - ``D``: Defines the depth of the FIFO and RAM, set to 512.
    - ``D_L``: Calculates the bit width needed to address the depth `D` using the logarithm base 2.
    - ``W``: Specifies the data width, set to 1.
- **Ports**:
    - ``i_r``: Indicates if there is empty space in the FIFO.
    - ``i_v``: Push signal to store data.
    - ``i_k``: Provides the key to the pusher.
    - ``i_d``: Data to be stored in the RAM.
    - ``o_r``: Pop signal to retrieve data.
    - ``o_k``: Key to pop data from the RAM.
    - ``o_d``: Data output from the RAM after a pop operation.
    - ``clk``: Clock signal for synchronization.
    - ``rst``: Reset signal to initialize the module.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Uses `always_ff` block to manage state transitions based on `idx_st` and control signals.
    - State 0 increments `idx_wd[0]` until it reaches 1024, then sets `idx_we[0]` and transitions to state 1.
    - State 1 increments `idx_wd[0]` until it reaches `D-1`, then clears `idx_we[0]` and transitions to state 2.
    - State 2 is an idle state with no operations.
    - Resets `idx_st`, `idx_we[0]`, and `idx_wd[0]` when `rst` is active.
    - `showahead_fifo` instance manages FIFO operations with write and read requests based on `idx_we` and `idx_rr`.
    - `simple_dual_port_ram` instance handles data storage and retrieval using `idx_rd` and `o_k` as addresses.
