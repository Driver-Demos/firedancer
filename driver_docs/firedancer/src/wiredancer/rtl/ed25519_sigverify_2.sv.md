Implements an ED25519 signature verification module with state management and modular multiplication.

# Purpose
The `ed25519_sigverify_2` module is designed to perform signature verification using the Ed25519 algorithm. It is a specialized component that interfaces with other modules to verify digital signatures. The module takes several inputs, including a clock signal (`clk`), a reset signal (`rst`), and various data inputs (`i_w`, `i_v`, `i_m`). It produces outputs that indicate the verification status (`o_v`) and processed metadata (`o_m`). The module uses a state machine to manage its operations, transitioning between states based on input conditions and internal logic.

A key component of this module is the instantiation of the `ed25519_mul_modp` submodule, which performs modular multiplication, a critical operation in the Ed25519 signature verification process. The module uses internal logic to prepare inputs for the multiplication operation and processes the results to determine the validity of the signature. The state machine controls the flow of data and ensures that the module operates correctly in response to the clock and reset signals. The use of `sv_meta6_t` and `sv_meta7_t` types suggests that the module handles complex data structures, likely related to the signature and metadata involved in the verification process.

### ed25519\_sigverify\_2
Implements a signature verification process using the Ed25519 algorithm. Utilizes a modular multiplication submodule to perform cryptographic operations.
- **Constants**:
    - ``MUL_T``: A constant parameter set to `32'h007F_CCC2`, used in the `ed25519_mul_modp` submodule.
- **Ports**:
    - ``i_r``: An output logic signal indicating the state of the input process.
    - ``i_w``: An input wire signal used to control the input process.
    - ``i_v``: An input wire signal used to validate the input process.
    - ``i_m``: An input wire carrying metadata of type `sv_meta6_t`.
    - ``o_v``: An output logic signal indicating the state of the output process.
    - ``o_m``: An output logic signal carrying metadata of type `sv_meta7_t`.
    - ``clk``: An input wire for the clock signal.
    - ``rst``: An input wire for the reset signal.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Uses two always_ff blocks triggered on the positive edge of `clk` to manage state transitions and data processing.
    - The first always_ff block handles the input state `st_i`, initializing multiplication inputs and transitioning states based on `i_v` and `i_w`.
    - The second always_ff block manages the output state `st_o`, updating output metadata and transitioning states based on `mul_o_v`.
    - The `ed25519_mul_modp` submodule performs modular multiplication using inputs `mul_i_A`, `mul_i_B`, and `mul_i_m`, and outputs `mul_o_C`, `mul_o_m`, and `mul_o_v`.
    - Resets `st_i` and `st_o` to 0 when `rst` is high.
