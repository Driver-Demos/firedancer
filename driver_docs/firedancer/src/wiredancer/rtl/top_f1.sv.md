Implements the `top_f1` module for handling PCIe, DMA, and DDR interfaces with various signal processing and verification stages.

# Purpose
The Verilog code defines a module named `top_f1`, which appears to be a top-level implementation for a hardware design involving data processing and verification. The module interfaces with various input and output signals, including those for memory-mapped I/O (`avmm_*`), PCIe (`pcie_*`), and DMA (`dma_*`). It also handles DDR memory operations (`ddr_*`) and includes debugging capabilities through the `dbg_wire` signal. The module is parameterized with several constants that configure its operation, such as `KEY_D`, `MUL_T`, `MUL_D`, and others, which likely relate to cryptographic or data processing tasks.

The module integrates several submodules and components, such as `piped_pending`, `piped_wire`, `pcie_inorder`, `pcie_tr_ext`, `dma_result`, `rrb_merge`, `sha512_pre`, and `ed25519_sigverify_*`. These components suggest that the module's primary function is to manage data flow and processing through a series of stages, including SHA-512 preprocessing, signature verification, and result handling. The use of pipelining and FIFO structures indicates that the design is optimized for high-throughput data processing. The module also includes logic for handling reset signals and clock domains, ensuring proper synchronization across different parts of the design.
