Implements a dual-clock show-ahead FIFO module with configurable parameters and asynchronous FIFO instantiation.

# Purpose
The `dual_clock_showahead_fifo` module implements a dual-clock FIFO (First-In-First-Out) buffer with show-ahead functionality, allowing for asynchronous data transfer between two clock domains. The module supports two library configurations, `xpm` and `exablaze`, which determine the underlying FIFO implementation. The `xpm` configuration uses Xilinx Parameterized Macros (XPM) for asynchronous FIFO, providing features such as programmable full and empty thresholds, error correction codes (ECC), and advanced status flags. The `exablaze` configuration uses a custom `async_fifo` module for similar functionality but with a different implementation approach.

The module's primary components include input and output ports for write and read operations, such as `wr_clk`, `wr_req`, `wr_data`, `rd_clk`, `rd_req`, and `rd_data`. It also provides status signals like `wr_full`, `rd_empty`, and their complements to indicate the FIFO's state. The module is parameterized by `WIDTH`, `DEPTH`, and `D_L`, allowing customization of data width, FIFO depth, and address width. The design ensures data integrity and synchronization across clock domains, making it suitable for applications requiring reliable data transfer between different clock frequencies.

### dual\_clock\_showahead\_fifo
Implements a dual-clock FIFO with show-ahead functionality, allowing asynchronous read and write operations. Supports different library configurations, such as `xpm` and `exablaze`, for flexible FIFO management.
- **Constants**:
    - ``LIB``: Specifies the library to use for FIFO implementation, default is `xpm`.
    - ``WIDTH``: Defines the width of the data bus, default is 32 bits.
    - ``DEPTH``: Specifies the depth of the FIFO, default is 32.
    - ``D_L``: Calculates the log base 2 of `DEPTH`, used for count width.
- **Ports**:
    - ``wr_clk``: Input clock for write operations.
    - ``wr_req``: Input signal to request a write operation.
    - ``wr_data``: Input data bus for writing data into the FIFO.
    - ``wr_full``: Output signal indicating the FIFO is full.
    - ``wr_full_b``: Output signal indicating the FIFO is not full (complement of `wr_full`).
    - ``wr_count``: Output bus indicating the number of words written into the FIFO.
    - ``rd_clk``: Input clock for read operations.
    - ``rd_req``: Input signal to request a read operation.
    - ``rd_data``: Output data bus for reading data from the FIFO.
    - ``rd_empty``: Output signal indicating the FIFO is empty.
    - ``rd_not_empty``: Output signal indicating the FIFO is not empty (complement of `rd_empty`).
    - ``rd_count``: Output bus indicating the number of words read from the FIFO.
    - ``aclr``: Input signal for asynchronous clear/reset.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Uses a `generate` block to select between different library implementations (`xpm` or `exablaze`).
    - In the `xpm` configuration, instantiates an `xpm_fifo_async` module with various parameters for FIFO management.
    - In the `exablaze` configuration, instantiates an `async_fifo` module with a different set of parameters.
    - Assigns `wr_full_b` as the complement of `wr_full` and `rd_not_empty` as the complement of `rd_empty`.
