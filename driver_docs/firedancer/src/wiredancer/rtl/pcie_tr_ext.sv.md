Implements a PCIe transaction extension module with buffering and signal verification.

# Purpose
The `pcie_tr_ext` module is a Verilog hardware description that processes PCI Express (PCIe) transaction layer packets. It is designed to handle data input and output operations, specifically managing the flow of PCIe data through a buffer. The module uses a parameterized buffer size (`BUFF_SZ`) to store incoming PCIe data and metadata, and it calculates the buffer's fill level (`pcie_l`) and full status (`pcie_f`). The module processes incoming data (`pcie_d`) and validates it using a magic number (`PCIE_MAGIC`) to ensure data integrity. It also manages transaction identifiers (`tid`) and constructs metadata for further processing.

The module includes a state machine with two states (`st_blk`) to control the data processing flow. In the first state, it initializes and prepares metadata based on the incoming data. In the second state, it processes the data, updates metadata fields, and manages the start and end of packet signals. The module uses a `showahead_fifo` to buffer processed data and metadata, allowing for asynchronous read and write operations. The FIFO ensures that data is available for output when requested, and it manages the synchronization between the input and output interfaces. The module is designed to operate synchronously with a clock (`clk`) and can be reset using a reset signal (`rst`).

### pcie\_tr\_ext
Implements a PCIe transaction extension module that processes incoming PCIe data and manages a FIFO buffer for output. Handles data flow control and metadata management for PCIe transactions.
- **Constants**:
    - ``BUFF_SZ``: Defines the buffer size for the FIFO, set to 1024.
    - ``BUFF_SZ_L``: Calculates the logarithm base 2 of `BUFF_SZ` to determine the bit width needed for addressing the buffer.
- **Ports**:
    - ``pcie_v``: Input signal indicating valid PCIe data.
    - ``pcie_d``: Input data bus for PCIe data, 512 bits wide.
    - ``pcie_f``: Output signal indicating if the FIFO is full.
    - ``pcie_l``: Output signal indicating the fill level of the FIFO.
    - ``o_v``: Output signal indicating valid data for reading.
    - ``o_r``: Input signal for read request.
    - ``o_e``: Output signal indicating end of packet.
    - ``o_m0``: Output for metadata type `sv_meta2_t`.
    - ``o_m1``: Output for metadata type `pcie_meta_t`.
    - ``clk``: Clock input signal.
    - ``rst``: Reset input signal.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Uses an `always_ff` block triggered on the rising edge of `clk` to manage state transitions and data processing.
    - Initializes and updates the `st_blk` state machine to control the processing of PCIe data.
    - In state 0, initializes block variables and checks for valid PCIe data with a specific magic number to transition to state 1.
    - In state 1, processes PCIe data, updates metadata, and manages the start and end of packet signals.
    - Resets the state machine and related signals when `rst` is asserted.
    - Instantiates a `showahead_fifo` to buffer processed data and manage read/write operations.
