Implements a multi-stage pipeline for ECC operations on Ed25519 signatures with various arithmetic operations.

# Purpose
The `ed25519_sigverify_ecc` module implements a multi-stage pipeline for performing various arithmetic and logical operations on large integers, specifically tailored for elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) operations related to the Ed25519 curve. The module processes inputs through a series of sub-pipelines, each responsible for different operations such as addition, subtraction, and modular arithmetic. The operations are parameterized by constants like `MUL_T`, `MUL_D`, `W_M`, and `W_D`, which define the characteristics of the arithmetic operations and the bit-widths of the data being processed.

The module uses a combination of logical operations and arithmetic operations, including bitwise AND, equality checks, shifts, and modular addition and subtraction. It also includes a specialized multiplication operation (`mul_modp`) for modular multiplication. The pipeline stages are implemented using a series of `always_ff` blocks and instantiated sub-modules like `piped_adder` and `ed25519_mul_modp`, which handle specific arithmetic tasks. The module is designed to handle inputs and outputs synchronously with a clock signal (`clk`) and can be reset using a reset signal (`rst`). The design is structured to support the efficient computation of ECC operations, which are critical in cryptographic applications.

    - Instantiates `piped_adder` modules for addition, subtraction, and addition modulo prime operations, with specific configurations for each operation.
    - Instantiates a `shift_adder_3` module for subtraction modulo prime, using a conditional assignment to handle the prime modulus.
    - Instantiates an `ed25519_mul_modp` module for multiplication modulo prime, using the `MUL_T` parameter for configuration.
