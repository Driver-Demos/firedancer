Implements a simple dual-port RAM module with configurable parameters for address and data width.

# Purpose
The Verilog code defines a module named `simple_dual_port_ram`, which implements a simple dual-port RAM using Xilinx's parameterized macro `xpm_memory_sdpram`. This module provides memory storage functionality with separate read and write ports, allowing simultaneous read and write operations. The module is parameterized to allow customization of address width, data width, clocking mode, memory primitive type, and write mode. These parameters enable the module to be adapted for various memory configurations and requirements.

The module includes input ports for read and write clocks, addresses, data, and control signals such as read and write enables. It outputs the read data through the port `q`. The instantiation of `xpm_memory_sdpram` within the module is configured with parameters that define the memory's behavior, such as address and data widths, clocking mode, and memory size. The module supports independent or common clocking for the read and write operations, and it can be configured to use different types of memory primitives, such as block or distributed memory. The code also includes detailed comments and a parameter usage table to guide users in configuring the module for their specific needs.

### simple\_dual\_port\_ram
Implements a simple dual-port RAM using Xilinx Parameterized Macros (XPM). Supports independent clocking for read and write operations with configurable parameters.
- **Constants**:
    - ``ADDRESS_WIDTH``: Defines the width of the address bus for both read and write operations.
    - ``DATA_WIDTH``: Specifies the width of the data bus for both read and write operations.
    - ``REGISTER_OUTPUT``: Indicates whether the output is registered (1) or not (0).
    - ``CLOCKING_MODE``: Determines if the read and write ports use a common clock or independent clocks.
    - ``MEMORY_PRIMITIVE``: Specifies the type of memory primitive to use, such as block or distributed.
    - ``WRITE_MODE``: Defines the write mode behavior for the memory, such as read-first.
- **Ports**:
    - ``rd_clock``: Clock signal for read operations.
    - ``rd_address``: Address input for read operations.
    - ``q``: Data output for read operations.
    - ``rd_en``: Enable signal for read operations.
    - ``wr_clock``: Clock signal for write operations.
    - ``wr_address``: Address input for write operations.
    - ``wr_byteenable``: Byte enable signal for write operations.
    - ``data``: Data input for write operations.
    - ``wr_en``: Enable signal for write operations.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Instantiates an XPM memory module `xpm_memory_sdpram` with parameters for address width, data width, and clocking mode.
    - Configures the memory with independent clocking for read and write operations using `CLOCKING_MODE`.
    - Uses `WRITE_MODE` to determine the behavior of write operations, such as read-first mode.
    - Connects the read and write address, data, and enable signals to the corresponding ports of the XPM memory instance.
    - Sets the memory size based on the address width and data width parameters.
