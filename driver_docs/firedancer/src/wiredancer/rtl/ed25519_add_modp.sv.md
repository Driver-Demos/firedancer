Implements a module for modular addition of ED25519 numbers using piped adders.

# Purpose
The `ed25519_add_modp` module performs modular addition operations specific to the Ed25519 elliptic curve, which is commonly used in cryptographic applications. The module takes two `W`-bit wide input operands, `in0` and `in1`, and a modulus input `m_i` of `M` bits. It outputs a `W`-bit result `out0` and a modified modulus `m_o`. The module uses two instances of a `piped_adder` to perform the addition and modular reduction operations. The first `piped_adder` instance computes the sum of the inputs `in0` and `in1`, while the second instance adjusts the result based on whether the intermediate sum exceeds the Ed25519 prime `ED25519_P`.

The module is designed to operate synchronously with a clock signal `clk` and can be reset using the `rst` signal. The `piped_adder` instances are parameterized to handle the bit-widths and modular arithmetic requirements. The logic `c_2_AB_ge_p` determines if the intermediate sum `c_2_AB` is greater than or equal to the Ed25519 prime, and this condition is used to adjust the final output. The module is part of a broader cryptographic library, as indicated by the import statement `import wd_sigverify::*`, which suggests that it relies on external definitions and constants related to signature verification.
# Modules

### ed25519\_add\_modp
Performs modular addition of two inputs `in0` and `in1` with respect to a modulus `ED25519_P`. Uses two instances of a `piped_adder` module to compute the result and adjust it based on the modulus.
- **Constants**:
    - ``W``: Defines the bit-width of the input operands, set to 255.
    - ``M``: Defines the bit-width of the modulus input and output, set to 128.
- **Ports**:
    - ``clk``: Clock signal for synchronization.
    - ``rst``: Reset signal to initialize the module.
    - ``in0``: First input operand for the addition.
    - ``in1``: Second input operand for the addition.
    - ``m_i``: Input modulus value.
    - ``m_o``: Output modulus value after processing.
    - ``out0``: Result of the modular addition.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Defines internal logic signals `m_o_p`, `c_2_AB`, `c_2_AB_ge_p`, and `out0_` for intermediate calculations.
    - Assigns `c_2_AB_ge_p` to check if `c_2_AB` is greater than or equal to `ED25519_P`.
    - Instantiates `c0_addmodp_inst` to perform the initial addition of `in0` and `in1` with zero carry-in.
    - Instantiates `c2_addmodp_inst` to adjust the result based on the comparison with `ED25519_P`, using `ED25519_P_N` if necessary.
