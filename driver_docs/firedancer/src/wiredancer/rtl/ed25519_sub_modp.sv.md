Implements a module for subtraction modulo a prime number in the Ed25519 signature scheme.

# Purpose
The `ed25519_sub_modp` module implements a subtraction operation in the context of the Ed25519 elliptic curve cryptography. It performs modular subtraction of two input values, `in0` and `in1`, with respect to a prime modulus `ED25519_P`. The module takes two 255-bit wide inputs (`in0` and `in1`) and a 128-bit modulus input (`m_i`). It outputs a 255-bit result (`out0`) and a 128-bit modified modulus (`m_o`). The module uses a `shift_adder_3` component to perform the subtraction and conditional addition of the modulus when `in0` is less than `in1`, ensuring the result remains non-negative.

The module is designed to operate synchronously with a clock (`clk`) and reset (`rst`) signal. It includes logic to determine if the subtraction result requires adjustment by comparing the intermediate result `c_2_AB` with the modulus `ED25519_P`. The `shift_adder_3` instance is configured to handle the arithmetic operations, including the inversion of `in1` and conditional addition of the modulus. The module is part of a broader cryptographic library, as indicated by the import statement `import wd_sigverify::*`, which suggests integration with other cryptographic verification components.
# Modules

---
### ed25519\_sub\_modp
Performs subtraction modulo a prime number, specifically for the Ed25519 curve. Utilizes a shift adder to compute the result and handles input and output through specified ports.
- **Constants**:
    - ``W``: Specifies the bit-width of the input and output data, set to 255.
    - ``M``: Specifies the bit-width of the modulus input and output, set to 128.
- **Ports**:
    - ``clk``: Clock signal input for synchronization.
    - ``rst``: Reset signal input to initialize the module.
    - ``in0``: First input operand for the subtraction operation.
    - ``in1``: Second input operand for the subtraction operation.
    - ``m_i``: Input modulus value for the operation.
    - ``m_o``: Output modulus value after the operation.
    - ``out0``: Result of the subtraction operation modulo the prime.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Defines internal logic signals `m_o_p`, `c_2_AB`, and `c_2_AB_ge_p` for intermediate calculations.
    - Assigns `c_2_AB_ge_p` to check if `c_2_AB` is greater than or equal to `ED25519_P`.
    - Defines `c_0_a_lt_b` to determine if `in0` is less than `in1`.
    - Instantiates `shift_adder_3` module to perform the subtraction and modulo operation, using `in0`, `~in1`, and a conditional input based on `c_0_a_lt_b`.
