Implements a parameterized wide multiplier module with various multiplication strategies in SystemVerilog.

# Purpose
The `mul_wide` module is a parameterized Verilog module designed to perform wide multiplication operations. It supports various multiplication techniques, including native, naive, and Karatsuba methods, as well as cascaded DSP implementations. The module is highly configurable through parameters such as `W`, `W0`, `W1`, `L`, `T`, `M`, and `S`, which define the bit widths and operational modes. The module takes two input operands, `in0` and `in1`, and produces a multiplication result `out0`. It also handles an additional input `m_i` and produces an output `m_o`, which can be used for further processing or pipelining.

The module uses a `generate` block to select the appropriate multiplication method based on the `CT` parameter. Each method is implemented in a separate block, allowing for different multiplication strategies to be employed depending on the configuration. For example, the native method directly multiplies the inputs, while the Karatsuba method uses a more complex algorithm to optimize the multiplication of large numbers. The module also includes instances of itself for recursive multiplication in certain configurations, demonstrating its ability to handle complex arithmetic operations. The use of `always_ff` blocks ensures that operations are synchronized with the clock signal, providing reliable and predictable behavior in synchronous digital systems.

### mul\_wide
Performs wide multiplication of two input values with configurable parameters. Supports different multiplication methods based on the `CT` parameter, including native, naive, W-1, Karatsuba, and cascaded DSP methods.
- **Constants**:
    - ``W``: Defines the width of the input and output data.
    - ``W0``: Sets the width of the first input, defaulting to `W`.
    - ``W1``: Sets the width of the second input, defaulting to `W`.
    - ``L``: Specifies a parameter for internal logic, default value is 4.
    - ``T``: A 32-bit constant used for configuration, default value is `32'h07FCCC`.
    - ``W2``: Defines half the width of `W`, used in some multiplication methods.
    - ``R_I``: Determines if input registers are used, default is 0.
    - ``CT``: Extracts a 4-bit value from `T` to select the multiplication method.
    - ``ST``: Shifts `T` by 4 bits, used for configuration.
    - ``M``: Defines the width of the multiplier input and output, default is 32.
    - ``S``: A parameter for internal logic, default value is 0.
- **Ports**:
    - ``clk``: Clock input for synchronization.
    - ``rst``: Reset input to initialize the module.
    - ``in0``: First input operand for multiplication.
    - ``in1``: Second input operand for multiplication.
    - ``m_i``: Input for the multiplier.
    - ``m_o``: Output of the multiplier.
    - ``out0``: Output of the multiplication result.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Uses a `generate` block to conditionally instantiate logic based on the `CT` parameter.
    - If `R_I` is true, registers the inputs `in0`, `in1`, and `m_i` on the rising edge of `clk`.
    - Implements different multiplication methods based on the value of `CT`.
    - For `CT == 0`, performs native multiplication with optional pipelining based on `ST`.
    - For `CT == 1`, uses a naive multiplication approach with sub-module instantiations for partial products.
    - For `CT == 2`, performs a W-1 multiplication method with sub-module instantiation.
    - For `CT == 12`, implements the Karatsuba multiplication algorithm with sub-module instantiations and piped adders.
    - For `CT == 15`, supports cascaded DSP multiplication with different configurations based on `ST`.
