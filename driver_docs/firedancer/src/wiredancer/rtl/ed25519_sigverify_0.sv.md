Implements a module for dispatching, processing, and merging ED25519 signature verification tasks using a round-robin policy.

# Purpose
The `ed25519_sigverify_0` module is designed to handle the dispatch and merging of signature verification tasks across multiple processors. It implements a round-robin scheduling policy to distribute incoming jobs to a set of processors, ensuring that each processor receives serialized inputs for each invocation. The module uses a series of FIFOs to manage data flow and backpressure, allowing multiple processors to produce results simultaneously. The results from these processors are then merged using a multiplexer, which also follows a round-robin policy to select outputs. The module includes a reassembly mechanism to consolidate multiple results from a single transaction into a single output cycle, which is then stored in a FIFO to handle backpressure.

The module also incorporates a key storage system to manage metadata efficiently, avoiding the need to send wide metadata into the processors. The design includes several key components such as the `key_store`, `shcl_cpu`, and `showahead_fifo` instances, which facilitate the processing and storage of data. The module is parameterized to allow flexibility in configuration, such as the number of schedulers (`N_SCH`) and key dimensions (`KEY_D`). The use of `always_ff` blocks and `generate` constructs ensures that the module can handle synchronous operations and instantiate multiple processing paths as needed.

### ed25519\_sigverify\_0
Implements a dispatch and merge mechanism for signature verification jobs using a round-robin policy. Serializes inputs to processors and reassembles outputs, supporting backpressure and metadata storage.
- **Constants**:
    - ``MUL_T``: A constant parameter with a value of `32'h007F_CCC2` used in the module.
    - ``MUL_D``: A constant parameter with a value of `15` used in the module.
    - ``N_SCH``: A constant parameter with a value of `2` representing the number of schedulers.
    - ``KEY_D``: A constant parameter with a value of `512` representing the key dimension.
    - ``KEY_D_L``: A constant parameter calculated as `$clog2(KEY_D)` representing the key dimension length.
- **Ports**:
    - ``i_r``: Output logic signal for backpressure.
    - ``i_w``: Input wire signal indicating wait state.
    - ``i_v``: Input wire signal indicating valid input.
    - ``i_m``: Input wire for metadata with a size of `$bits(sv_meta4_t)`.
    - ``o_v``: Output logic signal indicating valid output.
    - ``o_m``: Output logic for metadata with a size of `$bits(sv_meta5_t)`.
    - ``clk``: Input wire for the clock signal.
    - ``rst``: Input wire for the reset signal.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Uses a round-robin policy to dispatch jobs to processors, incrementing `sch_i_rrb` on each valid input cycle.
    - Implements a `key_store` instance to manage metadata storage and retrieval.
    - Contains an `always_ff` block to handle the round-robin index and reset conditions.
    - Uses a `generate` block to instantiate multiple schedulers (`G_SCH`) with serialized input handling and state management.
    - Each scheduler (`G_SCH`) uses an `always_ff` block to serialize inputs and manage state transitions based on input validity and readiness.
    - Instantiates a `piped_wire` to manage reset signal propagation with a depth of 2.
    - Each scheduler includes a `shcl_cpu` instance to process hash data and a `showahead_fifo` for output buffering.
    - Implements a `generate` block to reassemble outputs using `simple_dual_port_ram` instances, storing intermediate results.
    - Uses an `always_ff` block to manage output validity and reset conditions.
    - Displays debug information using `$display` statements within `always_ff` blocks.
