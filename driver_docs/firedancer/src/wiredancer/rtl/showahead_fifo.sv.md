Implements a parameterized show-ahead FIFO module with synchronous read/write operations and error handling.

# Purpose
The Verilog code defines two modules, `showahead_fifo` and `showahead_fifo_nx1`, which implement FIFO (First-In-First-Out) memory structures with specific features. The `showahead_fifo` module is a parameterized FIFO that supports synchronous read and write operations. It uses the Xilinx Parameterized Macro (XPM) for FIFO instantiation, allowing for customization of parameters such as data width, depth, and memory type. The module provides signals to indicate full and empty states, as well as programmable thresholds for almost full and almost empty conditions. It also includes error detection capabilities through ECC (Error Correction Code) modes.

The `showahead_fifo_nx1` module extends the functionality of the `showahead_fifo` by implementing an array of `N` FIFOs, each with a width of `WIDTH` and a depth of `DEPTH`. This module allows for parallel data handling, where multiple data streams can be written and read simultaneously. It manages the read and write operations across the array of FIFOs, providing outputs for full and empty states, as well as the ability to read all data streams at once. The use of generate statements facilitates the instantiation of multiple FIFO instances, making the design scalable and adaptable to different application requirements.
# Modules

---
### showahead\_fifo
Implements a show-ahead FIFO (First-In-First-Out) buffer with parameterized width and depth. Provides synchronous read and write operations with status signals for full and empty conditions.
- **Constants**:
    - ``WIDTH``: Defines the bit-width of the data bus for both read and write operations, defaulting to 32 bits.
    - ``DEPTH``: Specifies the depth of the FIFO, defaulting to 32 entries.
    - ``D_L``: Calculates the bit-width required to represent the depth of the FIFO using the base-2 logarithm.
    - ``FULL_THRESH``: Sets the threshold for the full condition, defaulting to 6 entries less than the total depth.
- **Ports**:
    - ``wr_clk``: Clock signal for write operations.
    - ``wr_req``: Write request signal to initiate a write operation.
    - ``wr_data``: Data input bus for writing data into the FIFO.
    - ``wr_full``: Indicates when the FIFO is full and cannot accept more data.
    - ``wr_full_b``: Complement of `wr_full`, indicating when the FIFO is not full.
    - ``wr_count``: Outputs the current count of written entries in the FIFO.
    - ``rd_clk``: Clock signal for read operations.
    - ``rd_req``: Read request signal to initiate a read operation.
    - ``rd_data``: Data output bus for reading data from the FIFO.
    - ``rd_empty``: Indicates when the FIFO is empty and no data is available for reading.
    - ``rd_not_empty``: Complement of `rd_empty`, indicating when the FIFO has data available for reading.
    - ``rd_count``: Outputs the current count of read entries in the FIFO.
    - ``aclr``: Asynchronous clear signal to reset the FIFO.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Assigns `wr_full_b` as the logical NOT of `wr_full`, indicating the FIFO is not full when `wr_full_b` is high.
    - Assigns `rd_not_empty` as the logical NOT of `rd_empty`, indicating the FIFO has data available when `rd_not_empty` is high.
    - Instantiates an `xpm_fifo_sync` module to implement the FIFO functionality with specified parameters for data width, depth, and other features.
    - Connects the `xpm_fifo_sync` instance to the module's ports, handling data input/output and control signals.

### showahead\_fifo\_nx1
Implements a show-ahead FIFO with multiple parallel FIFOs, allowing simultaneous read and write operations. Uses a generate block to instantiate multiple `showahead_fifo` modules, each handling a portion of the data.
- **Constants**:
    - ``N``: Defines the number of parallel FIFOs.
    - ``N_L``: Calculates the bit width needed to index the parallel FIFOs.
    - ``WIDTH``: Specifies the data width of each FIFO.
    - ``DEPTH``: Sets the depth of each FIFO.
    - ``D_L``: Calculates the bit width needed to index the depth of the FIFO.
    - ``FULL_THRESH``: Defines the threshold for the FIFO to be considered full.
- **Ports**:
    - ``wr_clk``: Clock signal for write operations.
    - ``wr_req``: Write request signal.
    - ``wr_data``: Data input for write operations.
    - ``wr_full``: Indicates if the FIFO is full.
    - ``wr_full_b``: Indicates if the FIFO is not full.
    - ``wr_count``: Shows the number of words written into the FIFO.
    - ``rd_clk``: Clock signal for read operations.
    - ``rd_req``: Read request signal.
    - ``rd_all``: Signal to read all data from the FIFO.
    - ``rd_data``: Data output for read operations.
    - ``rd_data_all``: Outputs all data from the FIFO.
    - ``rd_empty``: Indicates if the FIFO is empty.
    - ``rd_not_empty``: Indicates if the FIFO is not empty.
    - ``rd_count``: Shows the number of words read from the FIFO.
    - ``aclr``: Asynchronous clear signal.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Uses `logic` to define internal signals for full status, output valid status, and data storage.
    - Assigns `wr_full`, `wr_full_b`, and `wr_count` based on the last FIFO in the array.
    - Assigns `rd_not_empty`, `rd_empty`, `rd_data`, and `rd_data_all` based on the current read index `i`.
    - An `always_ff` block updates the read index `i` on `rd_clk` based on `rd_req` and `rd_all`, and resets `i` on `aclr`.
    - A `generate` block instantiates `N` `showahead_fifo` modules, each handling a portion of the data, with connections to the appropriate signals.
