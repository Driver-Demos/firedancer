Implements a dual-port instruction ROM module with parameterized width and depth.

# Purpose
The `schl_cpu_instr_rom` module defines a read-only memory (ROM) component for a CPU instruction set. It is parameterized by `ROM_WIDTH` and `ROM_DEPTH`, allowing flexibility in the width and depth of the ROM. The module uses a two-port interface, enabling simultaneous read operations from two different addresses, `a_addr` and `b_addr`, with corresponding enable signals `a_en` and `b_en`. The outputs `a_data` and `b_data` provide the data read from the ROM at the specified addresses.

The ROM is initialized using the `$readmemb` function, which loads data from a memory initialization file specified by the macro `PATH_TO_INSTR_ROM_MIF`. The module uses a synchronous read mechanism, where data is read on the rising edge of the clock signal `clk`. The `rst` input is present but not used in the current implementation. This module is typically used in CPU designs to store and provide access to instruction sets, serving as a fundamental component in the instruction fetch stage of a processor.

### schl\_cpu\_instr\_rom
Implements a read-only memory (ROM) for instruction storage with dual-port access. Provides data output based on address inputs and enable signals for two separate ports.
- **Constants**:
    - ``ROM_WIDTH``: Defines the width of the ROM data output.
    - ``ROM_DEPTH``: Sets the depth of the ROM, defaulting to 4096.
    - ``W_ROM_DEPTH``: Calculates the bit width needed to address the ROM depth using the ceiling of the logarithm base 2 of `ROM_DEPTH`.
- **Ports**:
    - ``clk``: Clock input for synchronizing data access.
    - ``rst``: Reset input, though not used in the module logic.
    - ``a_addr``: Address input for the first port to access ROM data.
    - ``a_en``: Enable signal for the first port to control data output.
    - ``a_data``: Data output for the first port, providing ROM data based on `a_addr`.
    - ``b_addr``: Address input for the second port to access ROM data.
    - ``b_en``: Enable signal for the second port to control data output.
    - ``b_data``: Data output for the second port, providing ROM data based on `b_addr`.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Defines a register array `IR` to store ROM data with a size of `ROM_WIDTH` by `ROM_DEPTH`.
    - Initializes the `IR` array with data from a memory initialization file specified by `PATH_TO_INSTR_ROM_MIF`.
    - Uses an `always_ff` block triggered on the rising edge of `clk` to control data output.
    - Checks if `a_en` is high to assign `a_data` with the value from `IR` at the address `a_addr`.
    - Checks if `b_en` is high to assign `b_data` with the value from `IR` at the address `b_addr`.
