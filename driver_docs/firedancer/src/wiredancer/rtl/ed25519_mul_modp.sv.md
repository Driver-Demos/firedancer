Implements a hardware module for modular multiplication using the Ed25519 curve in SystemVerilog.

# Purpose
The `ed25519_mul_modp` module implements a hardware design for performing modular multiplication operations, specifically tailored for the Ed25519 elliptic curve. This module takes two 255-bit input operands, `in0` and `in1`, and a modulus input `m_i` of configurable bit-width `M`, and produces a 255-bit output `out0` and a modulus output `m_o`. The design uses a series of pipelined adders and wide multipliers to perform the necessary arithmetic operations, ensuring efficient computation of the modular product. The module is parameterized with constants such as `T`, `CT`, `ST`, `R_I`, and `M`, which allow for customization of the internal operation and configuration of the arithmetic units.

The module includes several key components, such as `piped_adder` and `mul_wide`, which are instantiated multiple times to handle different parts of the arithmetic process. The design uses a combination of combinational and sequential logic, with optional input registers controlled by the `R_I` parameter. The `generate` block conditionally instantiates logic based on the `CT` parameter, allowing for flexibility in the design. The module also includes logic for handling carry propagation and modular reduction, ensuring that the output remains within the specified modulus. The use of local parameters and logic signals helps organize the arithmetic operations and manage intermediate results.
# Modules

### ed25519\_mul\_modp
Performs modular multiplication using the Ed25519 algorithm. Utilizes pipelined adders and wide multipliers to process 255-bit inputs and produce a 255-bit output.
- **Constants**:
    - ``T``: A 32-bit constant with a default value of `32'h007F_CCC2`.
    - ``CT``: Extracts the lower 4 bits from `T`.
    - ``ST``: Shifts `T` right by 4 bits.
    - ``R_I``: A constant that determines if input registers are used.
    - ``M``: A constant representing the bit width of certain operations, defaulting to 128.
- **Ports**:
    - ``clk``: Clock input signal.
    - ``rst``: Reset input signal.
    - ``in0``: First 255-bit input operand.
    - ``in1``: Second 255-bit input operand.
    - ``m_i``: Input modulus of `M` bits.
    - ``m_o``: Output modulus of `M` bits.
    - ``out0``: 255-bit output result of the modular multiplication.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Uses a `generate` block to conditionally register inputs based on `R_I` parameter.
    - If `R_I` is true, registers `in0`, `in1`, and `m_i` on the rising edge of `clk`. Otherwise, directly assigns them to internal signals.
    - Checks if `CT` equals 2 to execute specific logic for modular multiplication.
    - Defines several local parameters for configuration of pipelined adders and multipliers.
    - Instantiates multiple `piped_adder` and `mul_wide` modules to perform arithmetic operations on the inputs.
    - Uses `shift_adder_3` and `shift_adder_6` modules to perform complex arithmetic shifts and additions.
    - Combines results from arithmetic operations to produce the final output `out0`.
    - Assigns the final result of the modular multiplication to `out0` and the modulus output to `m_o`.
