Implements SHA-512 message scheduling logic using auxiliary round modules for data processing.

# Purpose
The Verilog code defines two modules, `aux_round_msgseq` and `sha512_msgseq`, which are part of a system for processing message sequences in the context of the SHA-512 cryptographic hash function. The `aux_round_msgseq` module is responsible for processing a single round of the message schedule, taking a 1024-bit input data block and producing a 64-bit word output. It uses a combination of bitwise operations and a `shift_adder_6` instance to compute the necessary transformations based on the current round index `INST_I`. The module includes assertions to ensure that parameters such as `INST_I`, `DATA_W`, and `WORD_W` are within expected ranges, providing error messages if they are not.

The `sha512_msgseq` module orchestrates the entire message scheduling process for SHA-512 by instantiating 80 instances of the `aux_round_msgseq` module, corresponding to the 80 rounds of the SHA-512 algorithm. It takes a 1024-bit input message block and outputs an array of 80 64-bit words, each representing a processed word for a round. The module adheres to the big-endian convention as specified in RFC6234, ensuring that the input data is correctly parsed and processed. The code includes comments explaining the padding and parsing of the input message, as well as an example from RFC6234 to illustrate the expected input and output format.
# Modules

---
### aux\_round\_msgseq
Implements a round message sequence for SHA-512 processing. Uses a combination of data manipulation and a shift adder to compute output words and data.
- **Constants**:
    - ``DATA_W``: Defines the data width, set to 1024 bits.
    - ``WORD_W``: Defines the word width, set to 64 bits.
    - ``INST_I``: Defines the instance index, set to -1 by default.
- **Ports**:
    - ``i_data``: Input data bus with a width of `DATA_W`.
    - ``o_data``: Output data bus with a width of `DATA_W`.
    - ``o_word``: Output word with a width of `WORD_W`.
    - ``clk``: Clock input signal.
    - ``rst``: Reset input signal.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Asserts ensure `INST_I` is between 0 and 79, `DATA_W` is 1024, and `WORD_W` is 64.
    - Assigns `i_data` to `data` for further processing.
    - Uses a `generate` block to handle different logic based on the value of `INST_I`.
    - For `INST_I` less than 16, assigns `word` directly from `data`.
    - For `INST_I` 16 or greater, computes `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` using bitwise operations and shifts on `data`.
    - Instantiates `shift_adder_6` to compute `word` from `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`.
    - An `always_ff` block updates `o_word` and `o_data` on the rising edge of `clk`.
    - For `INST_I` less than 16, `o_data` is assigned directly from `data`.
    - For `INST_I` 16 or greater, `o_data` is assigned a combination of `word` and shifted `data`.

### sha512\_msgseq
Implements the message scheduling for the SHA-512 algorithm by processing input data into a sequence of words for each round. Uses a big-endian convention to parse and transform the input data into 64-bit words.
- **Constants**:
    - ``DATA_W``: Defines the width of the input data, set to 1024 bits.
    - ``WORD_W``: Defines the width of each word, set to 64 bits.
    - ``ROUNDS``: Defines the number of rounds, set to 80.
    - ``D_WD_N``: Calculates the number of 64-bit words in the input data, which is 16.
    - ``CYCLES_MSGSEQ``: Defines the number of cycles for message sequencing, set to 1.
- **Ports**:
    - ``i_data``: Input data of width 1024 bits.
    - ``o_word``: Array of output words, each 64 bits wide, for each round.
    - ``clk``: Clock signal input.
    - ``rst``: Reset signal input.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Uses assertions to ensure `DATA_W`, `WORD_W`, and `ROUNDS` have specific values, and `D_WD_N` equals 16.
    - Initializes `t_data` to store transformed data for each round.
    - Uses an `always_comb` block to rearrange input data into 64-bit words in big-endian order.
    - Generates instances of `aux_round_msgseq` for each round, passing the transformed data and control signals.
    - The `generate` block iterates over the number of rounds, creating a message sequence for each round.
