Implements a PCIe inorder module with dual-port RAM for data handling and address matching.

# Purpose
The `pcie_inorder` module is a Verilog hardware description that manages data transactions over a PCI Express (PCIe) interface. It processes incoming PCIe data and addresses, and outputs them in an ordered manner. The module uses parameters such as `ADDR_MASK`, `ADDR_VAL`, `W`, and `D` to configure address matching and data width. The module includes logic to handle address matching, data validation, and timestamping to ensure data is processed in order. It uses dual-port RAM instances to store and retrieve data and timestamps, ensuring that data is read and written in a synchronized manner.

The module's functionality is controlled by input signals such as `pcie_v`, `pcie_a`, and `pcie_d`, and it outputs signals like `out_v`, `out_s`, `out_a`, and `out_d`. The module uses a clock (`clk`) and reset (`rst`) signal to synchronize operations. The `generate` block conditionally instantiates logic based on the `REG_O` parameter, which determines whether outputs are registered. The module also includes logic to increment a timestamp and manage read addresses, ensuring that data is processed in the correct sequence. The use of `simple_dual_port_ram` components facilitates efficient data storage and retrieval, supporting the module's primary function of maintaining in-order data processing for PCIe transactions.

### pcie\_inorder
Implements a PCIe interface that processes input data and addresses, and outputs validated data and addresses based on specific conditions. Uses dual-port RAM for data storage and retrieval, and includes logic for address matching and timestamp management.
- **Constants**:
    - ``ADDR_MASK``: Defines the address mask for matching PCIe addresses.
    - ``ADDR_VAL``: Specifies the address value for comparison with PCIe addresses.
    - ``W``: Sets the data width for PCIe data.
    - ``D``: Defines the depth of the dual-port RAM.
    - ``REG_O``: Determines if output registers are used.
    - ``W2``: Calculates half of the data width `W`.
    - ``W_L``: Calculates the log base 2 of the data width `W`.
    - ``D_L``: Calculates the log base 2 of the depth `D`.
- **Ports**:
    - ``pcie_v``: Input wire for PCIe valid signals.
    - ``pcie_a``: Input wire for PCIe addresses.
    - ``pcie_d``: Input wire for PCIe data.
    - ``out_v``: Output logic for valid signal.
    - ``out_s``: Output logic for status signal.
    - ``out_p``: Input wire for output processing signal.
    - ``out_a``: Output logic for address.
    - ``out_d``: Output logic for data.
    - ``clk``: Input wire for clock signal.
    - ``rst``: Input wire for reset signal.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Assigns `addr_match` to check if the PCIe address matches the specified address value using the address mask.
    - Calculates `out_iv` to determine if the output address and timestamp conditions are met.
    - Updates `rd_addr_n` based on the output valid and processing signals.
    - Uses a `generate` block to conditionally assign or register output signals based on `REG_O`.
    - Instantiates dual-port RAM modules for storing and retrieving PCIe data and timestamps.
    - Increments `timestamp` on each clock cycle and resets it on reset signal.
    - Resets `rd_addr` and `out_ia` when PCIe valid and address match conditions are met.
    - Updates `rd_addr` and `out_ia` based on output valid and processing signals.
