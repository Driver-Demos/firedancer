Implements a wide multiplier using DSP48E2 blocks for 17x26-bit multiplication in Verilog.

# Purpose
The code is a Verilog module that implements a digital signal processing (DSP) block using the `DSP48E2` primitive, which is a 48-bit multi-functional arithmetic block from Xilinx's Virtex UltraScale+ series. The module is designed to perform complex arithmetic operations, such as multiplication and addition, using a cascade of DSP blocks. The `DSP48E2` block is configured with various parameters to control its operation, including input selection, pattern detection, and pipeline stage configuration.

The module defines several logic vectors and parameters to manage the cascading of DSP blocks. The `NO_CASCADE` parameter determines the number of cascaded DSP blocks based on the input width `W1`. The code uses a generate loop to instantiate multiple DSP blocks, each with its own set of inputs and outputs. The inputs include data ports (`A`, `B`, `C`, `D`), control signals (`ALUMODE`, `OPMODE`), and clock/reset signals. The outputs include data results (`P`, `PCOUT`) and status signals (`OVERFLOW`, `UNDERFLOW`).

The module assigns values to the DSP block inputs and connects the outputs to form a cascade. The cascading is achieved by connecting the `PCOUT` of one block to the `PCIN` of the next block in the sequence. The final output is collected in the `out0` vector, which aggregates the results from all cascaded blocks. The code also handles leftover bits that do not fit into the cascade by assigning them separately. This module is intended for use in high-performance digital signal processing applications where multiple arithmetic operations are required in a pipelined and efficient manner.

### Ps
- **Type**: ``logic [NO_CASCADE-1:0][W0+17-1:0]``
- **Description**: Represents an array of logic vectors, where each vector has a width of `W0+17` bits. The array size is determined by the `NO_CASCADE` parameter, which is calculated as `(W1+16)/17`. This structure is used to store intermediate results of a computation.
- **Use**: Used to store and access intermediate computation results in a cascaded manner, with each element of the array corresponding to a stage in the cascade.


---
### Pcouts
- **Type**: ``logic [NO_CASCADE-1:0][48-1:0]``
- **Description**: `Pcouts` is a two-dimensional logic array with dimensions determined by the `NO_CASCADE` parameter and a fixed width of 48 bits. It stores the cascade output values (`PCOUT`) from a series of DSP48E2 instances.
- **Use**: Stores the cascade output values from DSP48E2 instances for further processing or cascading.
