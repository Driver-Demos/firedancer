Implements an ED25519 signature verification module with clock domain crossing and metadata handling.

# Purpose
The `ed25519_sigverify_1` module is a hardware description for a digital signature verification process using the Ed25519 algorithm. This module is part of a larger system that verifies digital signatures, ensuring data integrity and authenticity. The module interfaces with input and output signals, including clock and reset signals, and processes metadata and key information. It uses parameters such as `MUL_T`, `MUL_D`, `DSDP_WS`, and `KEY_D` to configure the operation of the signature verification process.

The module includes two main components: a `key_store` and an `ed25519_sigverify_dsdp_mul`. The `key_store` manages key storage and retrieval, while the `ed25519_sigverify_dsdp_mul` performs the core mathematical operations required for signature verification. The design uses clock domain crossing (CDC) FIFOs and registers to manage data flow and timing across different clock domains, ensuring reliable operation. The module is designed to operate with a slightly higher clock rate for the DSDP (Digital Signal Data Path) to maintain throughput and assist with timing closure. The use of metadata storage helps to optimize the data path by avoiding the transmission of wide metadata into the DSDP pipeline.

### ed25519\_sigverify\_1
Implements a signature verification process using the Ed25519 algorithm. Integrates key storage and a DSDP multiplication module for cryptographic operations.
- **Constants**:
    - ``MUL_T``: Defines the multiplication time constant for the DSDP multiplication module.
    - ``MUL_D``: Specifies the multiplication depth for the DSDP multiplication module.
    - ``DSDP_WS``: Sets the workspace size for the DSDP multiplication module.
    - ``KEY_D``: Defines the key depth for the key storage.
    - ``KEY_D_L``: Calculates the logarithmic value of `KEY_D` for internal logic sizing.
- **Ports**:
    - ``i_r``: Output signal indicating the readiness of the module.
    - ``i_w``: Input signal for write enable.
    - ``i_v``: Input signal for valid data indication.
    - ``i_m``: Input signal carrying metadata of type `sv_meta5_t`.
    - ``o_v``: Output signal indicating valid output data.
    - ``o_m``: Output signal carrying metadata of type `sv_meta6_t`.
    - ``clk``: Clock input signal for synchronous operations.
    - ``rst``: Reset input signal to initialize the module.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Assigns `i_r` as a logical AND of `i_rr[0]`, `i_rr[1]`, and the negation of `i_w`.
    - Assigns `i_mm` to `i_m` and `o_m` to `o_mm`.
    - In the `always_ff` block, updates `o_v` and `o_mm` fields on the rising edge of `clk`.
    - Resets `o_v` to 0 when `rst` is active.
    - Instantiates `key_store` module to manage key storage and retrieval.
    - Instantiates `ed25519_sigverify_dsdp_mul` module for DSDP multiplication operations.
