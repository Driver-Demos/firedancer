Implements a SHA-512 scheduler module in SystemVerilog with input/output logic and RAM management.

# Purpose
The `sha512_sch` module is a Verilog hardware description that implements a scheduling mechanism for processing SHA-512 hash blocks. It is designed to handle data transactions in a pipelined manner, managing input and output blocks with associated metadata such as transaction IDs and block validity. The module uses parameters to define the width of blocks (`W_BLK`), the width of transaction IDs (`W_M`), and the number of blocks per transaction (`BLKS_PER_TR`). It also defines the depth of RAM (`RAM_D`) and the number of cycles (`N_CYCLES`) for processing.

The module includes several key components: two instances of `simple_dual_port_ram` for storing cycle metadata and block data, and a `showahead_fifo` for managing free address indices. The module processes input blocks (`iblk_*` signals) and outputs processed blocks (`oblk_*` signals) while maintaining control over the flow of data using backpressure (`iblk_p`). The design uses a state machine approach with multiple stages (`c00`, `c01`, `c02`, `c03`) to manage the reading, processing, and writing of data blocks. The module also includes logic to handle reset conditions and initialize internal counters.

### sha512\_sch
Implements a SHA-512 scheduling module that manages data blocks and transactions. It uses dual-port RAM and FIFO for data handling and synchronization.
- **Constants**:
    - ``W_BLK``: Defines the width of a block, set to 64 bits.
    - ``W_M``: Defines the width of a transaction ID, set to 64 bits.
    - ``BLKS_PER_TR``: Specifies the number of blocks per transaction, set to 10.
    - ``RAM_D``: Defines the depth of the RAM, set to 512.
    - ``N_CYCLES``: Specifies the number of cycles, set to 100.
    - ``RAM_E``: Calculates the effective RAM depth per transaction, as `RAM_D / BLKS_PER_TR`.
    - ``N_CYCLES_L``: Calculates the log base 2 of `N_CYCLES` for addressing.
    - ``RAM_D_L``: Calculates the log base 2 of `RAM_D` for addressing.
- **Ports**:
    - ``oblk_v``: Indicates if the output block is valid.
    - ``oblk_d``: Carries the output block data.
    - ``oblk_t``: Carries the output transaction ID.
    - ``oblk_f``: Indicates if the output block is the first block.
    - ``oblk_m``: Indicates if the output block is a middle block.
    - ``oblk_l``: Indicates if the output block is the last block.
    - ``iblk_v``: Indicates if the input block is valid.
    - ``iblk_f``: Indicates if the input block is the first block.
    - ``iblk_c``: Specifies the number of input blocks.
    - ``iblk_d``: Carries the input block data.
    - ``iblk_t``: Carries the input transaction ID.
    - ``iblk_p``: Indicates backpressure, applied only for the first block.
    - ``clk``: Clock signal for synchronization.
    - ``rst``: Reset signal to initialize the module.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Uses `always_comb` block to calculate backpressure (`iblk_p`) and free pop signal (`c02_free_pop`).
    - Uses `always_ff` block on the positive edge of `clk` to manage cycle addresses and data flow through the pipeline stages (`c00`, `c01`, `c02`, `c03`).
    - Initializes and increments `free_init_cnt` to manage free space in the FIFO.
    - Resets internal states and counters when `rst` is asserted.
    - Instantiates `simple_dual_port_ram` for cycle metadata and block data storage.
    - Instantiates `showahead_fifo` for managing free address space.
