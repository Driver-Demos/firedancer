Makefile for building the `fd_wiredancer` library with specified headers and objects if `FD_HAS_WIREDANCER` is defined.

# Purpose
The `Makefile` snippet conditionally includes the `fd_wiredancer` library if the `FD_HAS_WIREDANCER` flag is defined. It uses the `make-lib` function to create the library and adds the header file `c/wd_f1.h` and the object files from the `c/wd_f1` directory to the build process. This setup ensures that the `fd_wiredancer` components are only included when the specified condition is met.
