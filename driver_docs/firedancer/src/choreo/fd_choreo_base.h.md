Defines constants, types, and functions for the Choreo consensus library, including block and voter management.

# Purpose
This C header file defines constants, macros, and type definitions for a consensus library related to blockchain technology. It includes functionality for handling block and vote equivocation, managing the frontier of banks, implementing a fork choice rule, and tracking voters using the TowerBFT algorithm. The file sets maximum limits for blocks and voters, and defines percentage thresholds for equivocation safety and confirmation. It provides macros for comparing and hashing slot hashes and public keys, which are essential for maintaining the integrity and uniqueness of blocks within the blockchain. The `fd_block_id_t` type is defined as a 32-byte array representing the Merkle root of the last FEC set for a slot, ensuring unique block identification even in cases of leader equivocation.
