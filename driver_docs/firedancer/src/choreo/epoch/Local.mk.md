Makefile logic to add headers and objects if 128-bit integer support is available.

# Purpose
The `Makefile` snippet uses a conditional directive to check if the macro `FD_HAS_INT128` is defined. If it is defined, the script calls the `add-hdrs` function to include the header file `fd_epoch.h` and calls the `add-objs` function to add the object files `fd_epoch` and `fd_choreo`. This setup is used to conditionally compile and link specific components based on the availability of 128-bit integer support.
