Makefile for building the fd_choreo library and its unit tests if FD_HAS_INT128 is defined.

# Purpose
The `Makefile` content conditionally compiles and tests the `fd_choreo` library if the `FD_HAS_INT128` flag is defined. It uses the `make-lib` function to build the `fd_choreo` library and the `add-hdrs` function to include the headers `fd_choreo_base.h` and `fd_choreo.h`. Additionally, it sets up a unit test named `test_choreo_base` that depends on the `fd_choreo`, `fd_flamenco`, `fd_ballet`, and `fd_util` components.
