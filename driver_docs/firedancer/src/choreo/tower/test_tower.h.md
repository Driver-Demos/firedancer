Header file with static unsigned character arrays for versioning and restoration data.

# Purpose
The code defines three static arrays of type `uchar` named `v1_14_11`, `current`, and `restore`. These arrays contain hexadecimal values and are initialized with a large number of elements. The arrays are declared as `static`, which means they are only accessible within the file in which they are declared. The inclusion of the header file `fd_util_base.h` suggests that the code may rely on utility functions or definitions provided in that file, although the specific usage is not visible in the provided code.

The primary purpose of this code appears to be the storage of binary data in the form of byte arrays. These arrays could represent serialized data, configuration settings, or other forms of binary information that the program needs to access or manipulate. The naming of the arrays (`v1_14_11`, `current`, and `restore`) suggests that they may be used to store different versions or states of data, possibly for version control, state management, or data restoration purposes. The code does not define any functions or public APIs, indicating that its role is likely to provide internal data storage rather than direct functionality or interface to other parts of a program.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `../../util/fd_util_base.h`


# Global Variables

---
### v1\_14\_11
- **Type**: ``uchar[]``
- **Description**: An array of unsigned characters with a size of 3731 elements. The array is initialized with a sequence of hexadecimal values.
- **Use**: Stores a sequence of bytes, possibly representing binary data or encoded information.


---
### current
- **Type**: ``static uchar[]``
- **Description**: An array of unsigned characters with a size of 3762 elements, initialized with a sequence of hexadecimal values. The array is declared as static, indicating it has internal linkage and retains its value between function calls.
- **Use**: Stores a sequence of bytes, possibly representing binary data or a serialized structure, for use within the file.


---
### restore
- **Type**: ``static uchar[]``
- **Description**: An array of unsigned characters with a size of 2319 elements, initialized with hexadecimal values. The array is declared as static, meaning it has internal linkage and retains its value between function calls.
- **Use**: Stores a sequence of bytes, possibly for data restoration or configuration purposes.
