Makefile for building `fd_voter` components and unit tests with conditional compilation flags.

# Purpose
This Makefile script conditionally includes and builds components based on the presence of certain features. If `FD_HAS_INT128` is defined, it adds the header file `fd_voter.h`. If both `FD_HAS_INT128` and `FD_HAS_HOSTED` are defined, it compiles the binary `fd_voter_ctl` and the unit test `test_voter`, linking them with the libraries `fd_choreo`, `fd_flamenco`, `fd_ballet`, and `fd_util`.
