Reads a JSON file, parses data, and logs a base58-encoded vote account address.

# Purpose
This code is an executable C program that reads a JSON file, processes its contents, and logs a Base58-encoded address. The program begins by initializing the environment with `fd_boot`, which prepares the command-line arguments. It then opens a specific JSON file located at `/home/chali/.firedancer/fd1/vote-1.json` and reads a line from it. The line is expected to contain a sequence of numbers, which the program tokenizes and parses into an array of unsigned characters (`uchar`). The program processes 64 tokens, but only the last 32 are converted into bytes.

After parsing, the program encodes these bytes into a Base58 string using the `fd_base58_encode_32` function from the `fd_base58` library. The resulting Base58-encoded string represents a vote account address, which is logged using `FD_LOG_NOTICE`. The program concludes by calling `fd_halt` to perform any necessary cleanup before exiting. This code is designed to be executed directly and does not define any public APIs or external interfaces.

Reads a JSON file, extracts numeric data, converts it to bytes, and logs a Base58 encoded vote account address.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments.
    - `argv`: An array of command-line argument strings.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Calls `fd_boot` to initialize the environment with command-line arguments.
    - Opens the file `/home/chali/.firedancer/fd1/vote-1.json` for reading and checks if the file is successfully opened using `FD_TEST`.
    - Reads a line from the file into the `line` buffer and checks for successful read using `FD_TEST`, then closes the file.
    - Initializes a `bytes` array to store 32 bytes of data.
    - Uses `strtok` to tokenize the `line` string, iterating over 64 tokens.
    - For tokens with index 32 and above, converts the token to an integer, checks if it is within the valid range for an unsigned char, and stores it in the `bytes` array.
    - Encodes the `bytes` array into a Base58 string and logs the result as a vote account address using `FD_LOG_NOTICE`.
    - Calls `fd_halt` to terminate the program.
- **Output**: Returns 0 to indicate successful execution.
