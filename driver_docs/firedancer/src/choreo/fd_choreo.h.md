Header file for including various modules like fd_choreo_base, fd_epoch, fd_eqvoc, and others.

# Purpose
This code is a C header file that uses include guards to prevent multiple inclusions of the same file, which can cause compilation errors. The header file includes several other header files: `fd_choreo_base.h`, `fd_epoch.h`, `fd_eqvoc.h`, `fd_ghost.h`, `fd_notar.h`, `fd_tower.h`, and `fd_voter.h`. These included files suggest that the header file is part of a larger system, possibly related to choreography or orchestration, involving components like epochs, voting, and notarization. The include guard is defined by `HEADER_fd_src_choreo_fd_choreo_h`, ensuring that the file's contents are only included once in a single compilation unit.
