Makefile for building targets with support for machine-specific configurations and optional features.

# Purpose
This Makefile is used to manage the build process for a software project. It supports parallel builds using the `-j` option and allows for customization based on the target machine through the `MACHINE` environment variable. By default, it builds for the native machine, but users can specify a different machine by setting `MACHINE=my_machine`, which will use the configuration defined in `config/machine/my_machine.mk`. The `EXTRAS` environment variable enables optional build features by including additional configuration files from the `config/extra` directory. The Makefile also provides a mechanism to print help information for available build targets and configurations specific to the selected machine. It is designed to work efficiently on systems with CPU isolation by using non-isolated CPUs for the build process.
