Documentation for the Firedancer Solana validator, highlighting its performance, security, and independence.

# Purpose
The YAML configuration file defines the layout and content for the home page of a VitePress site. It specifies the `layout` as `home` and includes a `hero` section that introduces "Firedancer," a Solana validator client. The `hero` section contains a name, descriptive text, a tagline, and action buttons with links for users to get started or view the project on GitHub. Additionally, the file outlines `features` of the Firedancer client, highlighting its speed, security, and independence. Each feature is described with a title and detailed explanation, emphasizing the client's design and architecture.
