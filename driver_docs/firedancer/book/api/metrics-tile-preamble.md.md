Documentation for performance counters in QUIC tiles, detailing metric labels and examples.

# Purpose
The content describes the structure and purpose of performance counters for QUIC tiles in a system. Each QUIC tile, representing a CPU core assigned to handle QUIC connections, has its own set of performance counters that are not aggregated across tiles. The metrics are reported with two labels: `kind`, which specifies the tile name, and `kind_id`, which indicates the tile index. This allows for the identification of metrics specific to each tile. The example provided shows counters for the total number of connections created and the number of connections aborted, with separate entries for each tile.
