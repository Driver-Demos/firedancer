Documentation of various metrics related to network, transactions, and system performance in the Firedancer codebase.

# Purpose
The content describes a comprehensive set of metrics for monitoring various components of a software system. These metrics are organized into different categories or "tiles," each representing a specific aspect of the system's operation. The metrics are primarily counters and gauges, which track occurrences and states, respectively. For example, the `All Links` section includes metrics related to link consumption and filtering, while the `Net Tile` section covers network packet transmission and reception. Other sections, such as `Quic Tile` and `Bundle Tile`, focus on specific protocols or functionalities, like QUIC connections and bundle processing. Each metric is defined with a name, type, and description, providing detailed insights into the system's performance and behavior. This structured approach allows for effective monitoring and troubleshooting of the system by providing precise data points on various operational aspects.
# Content Summary
The provided content is a comprehensive list of metrics for a software system, organized into various categories or "tiles." Each tile represents a different aspect of the system, and within each tile, there are specific metrics that track various operations and states. Here is a summary of the key functional details for each tile:

1. **All Links**: This section tracks metrics related to link operations, such as the number of times a consumer is rate-limited, fragments consumed, and input overruns during polling and reading.

2. **All Tiles**: This section includes metrics for process and thread IDs, context switches, tile status, heartbeat timestamps, backpressure states, and regime durations.

3. **Net Tile**: This section monitors network-related metrics, including packet counts, bytes transmitted and received, packet drops due to various reasons, and buffer states.

4. **Quic Tile**: This section tracks QUIC protocol metrics, including transaction counts, fragment handling, connection states, packet decryption failures, and frame reception.

5. **Bundle Tile**: This section includes metrics for transactions and bundles received, gRPC errors, heap size, RTT samples, and message delays.

6. **Verify Tile**: This section tracks verification failures for transactions, including parsing, deduplication, and verification errors.

7. **Dedup Tile**: This section monitors deduplication failures and the receipt of gossiped votes.

8. **Resolv Tile**: This section tracks transaction resolution metrics, including stash operations, LUT resolutions, and blockhash expiration.

9. **Pack Tile**: This section includes metrics for transaction scheduling, insertion results, timing states, and cost unit consumption.

10. **Bank Tile**: This section monitors transaction execution results, address lookup table loading, and transaction errors.

11. **Poh Tile**: This section tracks delays related to leader slots and bundle initialization.

12. **Shred Tile**: This section includes metrics for microblock shredding, processing results, and FEC set handling.

13. **Store Tile**: This section tracks the number of transactions inserted while being a leader.

14. **Sign Tile**: This section monitors the duration of message signing.

15. **Metric Tile**: This section includes a single metric for the boot timestamp of the validator.

16. **Replay Tile**: This section tracks metrics related to FEC set linking, reading, publishing, and slot management.

17. **Storei Tile**: This section includes metrics for turbine slot tracking.

18. **Gossip Tile**: This section monitors gossip protocol metrics, including ping tracking, CRDS counts, and message transmission.

19. **Netlnk Tile**: This section tracks netlink events, syncs, updates, and neighbor solicitations.

20. **Sock Tile**: This section includes metrics for socket syscalls, packet counts, and byte transmission.

21. **Repair Tile**: This section tracks repair-related metrics, including packet types, slot completion times, and response latencies.

22. **Send Tile**: This section monitors sending operations, including contact info handling, connection results, and QUIC packet handling.

23. **Snapct Tile**: This section tracks snapshot download retries, bytes read and written, and gossip peer counts.

24. **Snapld Tile**: This section includes a single metric for the state of the tile.

25. **Snapdc Tile**: This section tracks snapshot decompression metrics, including bytes read from compressed and decompressed files.

26. **Snapin Tile**: This section monitors snapshot insertion metrics, including bytes read and accounts inserted.

27. **Ipecho Tile**: This section tracks metrics related to the ipecho service, including connection counts and bytes read and written.

28. **Gossvf Tile**: This section monitors gossip message reception, including outcomes and byte counts.

29. **Bankf Tile**: This section tracks transaction execution results, including success and various error conditions.

30. **Resolf Tile**: This section monitors transaction resolution metrics, including stash operations and LUT resolutions.

31. **Backt Tile**: This section includes metrics for backtest slots.

32. **Exec Tile**: This section tracks program cache metrics, including hits, misses, fills, and invalidations.

Each metric is categorized by type (e.g., counter, gauge, histogram) and includes a description of what it measures. This detailed breakdown allows developers to monitor and analyze the performance and behavior of the system across various components.
