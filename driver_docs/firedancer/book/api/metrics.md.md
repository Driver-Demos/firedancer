Documentation for Firedancer's internal performance counters exposed via a Prometheus HTTP endpoint.

# Purpose
Firedancer uses internal performance counters to help developers and monitoring tools track system performance. These metrics are accessible through a Prometheus HTTP endpoint, which is configured to listen on port 7999 as specified in the `config.toml` file. Users can retrieve metrics by sending a request to `http://localhost:7999/metrics`, which returns data such as process IDs for different components like `net`, `quic`, `verify`, and `dedup`. The metrics follow the Prometheus data model and include three types: `counter`, `gauge`, and `histogram`. It is important to note that these metrics are intended for developer and diagnostic use, and the endpoint or data may change without notice.
