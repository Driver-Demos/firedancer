Documentation for metrics related to single-producer multi-consumer data queues between tiles.

# Purpose
The content describes metrics for monitoring data queues, known as links, between tiles in a system. These links operate as single-producer multi-consumer queues, where each link can have multiple consumers. The metrics are reported using a counter named `link_published_size_bytes`, which tracks the total number of bytes read by each link consumer. Each metric entry is associated with four labels: `kind`, `kind_id`, `link_kind`, and `link_kind_id`. These labels identify the specific consumer and link, with `kind` and `kind_id` indicating the consumer tile's name and index, and `link_kind` and `link_kind_id` specifying the link's name and index.
