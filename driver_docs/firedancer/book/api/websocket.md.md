Documentation for the Firedancer WebSocket API, detailing connection, compression, data streaming, and query functionalities.

# Purpose
The document describes the Firedancer WebSocket API, which provides a mechanism for clients to subscribe to validator information. This API is primarily used to support the Firedancer GUI and allows clients to connect via WebSocket to receive real-time updates on various topics related to the state and performance of a Solana validator. The API is organized into several conceptual categories, including connection setup, message compression, data streaming, and specific topics such as `summary`, `block_engine`, `epoch`, `gossip`, `peers`, and `slot`. Each topic provides detailed information about different aspects of the validator's operation, such as performance metrics, network statistics, peer information, and slot processing details. The API is not stable or versioned, and its use requires caution as it may change or produce incorrect data. The document also includes examples of JSON message formats for different API requests and responses, illustrating how clients can interact with the API to query or receive updates on specific data points.
# Content Summary
The provided document describes the Firedancer WebSocket API, which is an optional HTTP WebSockets API for subscribing to validator information. This API is primarily used to support the Firedancer GUI. The document outlines several key components and functionalities of the API, including connection details, message compression, data streaming, and various topics related to validator operations.

### Key Functional Details:

1. **Connection and Configuration**:
   - To connect to the API, a WebSocket client must be created, typically connecting to `ws://localhost:80/websocket`. The port is specified in the validator's configuration file.
   - The API supports message compression for messages larger than 200 bytes if the client specifies the `compress-zstd` subprotocol during the WebSocket handshake.

2. **Data Streaming and Topics**:
   - The API streams data on various topics to connected clients. These topics include `summary`, `block_engine`, `epoch`, `gossip`, `peers`, and `slot`.
   - Each topic provides specific information, such as validator state, block engine status, epoch details, gossip network statistics, peer information, and slot data.

3. **Message Frequency and Format**:
   - Messages are published with different frequencies, such as `Once`, `Live`, `Request`, and at regular intervals (e.g., every second).
   - All data is encoded in JSON format, with a structured envelope containing fields like `topic`, `key`, and `value`.

4. **Slot and Transaction Details**:
   - The API provides detailed information about slots, including their status (e.g., `incomplete`, `completed`, `rooted`), transaction counts, and performance metrics.
   - It also supports queries for historical slot data and transaction details, allowing clients to request specific information about past slots.

5. **Gossip and Peer Information**:
   - The API includes detailed metrics about the gossip network, such as network traffic, peer connections, and storage statistics.
   - Peer information is authenticated and includes details about validator identity, gossip data, vote accounts, and self-reported information.

6. **Warnings and Stability**:
   - The API is not stable, not versioned, and may change or become unavailable without notice. Users are advised to use it with caution.

This document serves as a comprehensive guide for developers working with the Firedancer WebSocket API, providing essential details for connecting, configuring, and utilizing the API to access validator information.
