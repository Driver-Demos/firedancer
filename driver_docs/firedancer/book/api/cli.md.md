Documentation for the `fdctl` command line interface, detailing subcommands for managing and monitoring Firedancer.

# Purpose
The `fdctl` command line interface is a tool for managing and operating the Firedancer validator. It includes several subcommands, each serving a specific function. The `run` command starts the validator and requires certain system capabilities to function correctly, such as `CAP_NET_RAW` and `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`, to manage network and system resources. The `monitor` command provides real-time performance monitoring of a running validator, also requiring specific capabilities for sandboxing and resource management. The `configure` command prepares the operating system environment for Firedancer by setting kernel parameters, managing huge pages, and configuring network devices. It includes stages like `hugetlbfs`, `sysctl`, and `ethtool-channels`, each with specific system requirements. The `version` and `shred-version` commands output the current version and shred version of the validator, respectively. The `metrics` command outputs validator metrics, while the `set-identity` command changes the identity key of a running validator, requiring careful handling to avoid consensus violations. The `keys` subcommands manage keypairs, allowing users to print public keys or create new keypairs. Finally, the `mem` command provides detailed information about the memory requirements and configuration of the validator, ensuring that Firedancer has the necessary resources preallocated and locked. Each command typically requires a configuration TOML file to specify settings and parameters.
# Content Summary
The provided content describes the `fdctl` Command Line Interface (CLI) for the Firedancer software, detailing its various subcommands and their functionalities. Below is a summary of the key technical details for each subcommand:

1. **`run`**: This command starts the validator and continues running until the validator stops. It requires a configuration TOML file specified with the `--config <path>` argument. The command outputs logs to `stderr` and requires certain capabilities, such as `CAP_NET_RAW` and `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`, to perform operations like binding to raw sockets and initializing XDP.

2. **`monitor`**: This command monitors a locally running validator, providing performance diagnostics. It also requires a configuration TOML file and similar capabilities as the `run` command for sandboxing and resource management.

3. **`configure`**: This command prepares the operating system to run Firedancer by setting up huge pages, kernel parameters, and network device configurations. It includes subcommands like `configure init`, `configure check`, and `configure fini` to initialize, verify, and clean up the system configuration, respectively. Root privileges are required for certain stages.

4. **`version`**: This command outputs the current version of the validator to `stdout`.

5. **`shred-version`**: This command outputs the current shred version of the cluster being joined.

6. **`metrics`**: This command prints the current validator metrics to `stdout`, useful when the metrics server is not enabled or the validator has crashed.

7. **`set-identity`**: This command changes the identity key of a running validator. It requires a keypair file and the same configuration file used to start the validator. The command includes options like `--require-tower` and `--force` for specific scenarios.

8. **`keys`**: This section includes subcommands like `keys pubkey` to print the public key from a key file and `keys new` to create a new keypair. The `keys new` command requires a configuration TOML file to determine the user creating the file.

9. **`mem`**: This command provides information about the memory requirements and tile configuration of the validator. It outputs details about memory allocation and usage, which are preallocated and locked by Firedancer.

Each command is designed to manage different aspects of the Firedancer validator, from initialization and monitoring to configuration and identity management. The use of configuration files and specific system capabilities is a recurring requirement across these commands.
