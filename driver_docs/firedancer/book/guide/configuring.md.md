Guide for configuring Firedancer using a TOML file, including options, logging, layout, and GUI settings.

# Purpose
The configuration file for Firedancer is a TOML file that allows operators to customize the behavior of the Firedancer application. Operators can specify only the options they wish to change, as most options have recommended default values. The file includes sections for configuring network entry points, consensus parameters, RPC settings, logging levels, and system layout. For example, the `[gossip]` section specifies network entry points, while the `[consensus]` section includes parameters like `expected_genesis_hash` and paths to keypair files. The `[layout]` section configures CPU core affinity for different processing tiles, optimizing system throughput. Additionally, the configuration file can enable a GUI for monitoring the validator. Operators can use the `FIREDANCER_CONFIG_TOML` environment variable or the `--config` option to apply the configuration file.
# Content Summary
The provided content describes the configuration process for Firedancer, a software application, using a TOML file. The configuration file allows users to specify options that override the default settings provided by Firedancer. The key sections of the configuration file include:

1. **Overview**: Firedancer uses a TOML file for configuration. Most options have default values, and users only need to specify changes. The `default.toml` file contains the full list of options.

2. **Migration**: When migrating from the Agave validator, command line options must be transferred to the corresponding TOML configuration options.

3. **Example Configuration**: An example TOML file for a testnet validator is provided. It includes sections for user settings, gossip entry points, consensus parameters, RPC settings, and file paths for identity and vote accounts.

4. **Usage**: The configuration file can be used by setting the `FIREDANCER_CONFIG_TOML` environment variable or by using the `--config` option in commands. Consistency in using the same configuration file across commands is crucial to avoid failures.

5. **Logging**: Firedancer maintains two types of logs: a permanent log and an ephemeral log. The log level for stderr can be configured in the TOML file.

6. **Layout**: Firedancer optimizes performance by assigning a dedicated thread to each CPU core. The configuration file allows users to specify the number of tiles and their CPU core affinities. Users can set affinities to "auto" for automatic configuration.

7. **GUI**: Firedancer includes a GUI that can be enabled in the configuration file. By default, it listens on `127.0.0.1:80`, but this can be changed using specific options.

8. **Options**: The document references a list of all available configuration options and their default values, which are detailed in the `default.toml` file. Users only need to override options they wish to change.

This configuration setup allows for flexible and efficient management of Firedancer's operational parameters, ensuring that users can tailor the application to their specific needs while maintaining optimal performance.
