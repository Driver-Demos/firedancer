Troubleshooting steps for building, configuring, and running Frankendancer, with error-specific solutions.

# Purpose
This document provides troubleshooting guidance for operators who encounter errors while building and running the Frankendancer software. It includes sections on building, configuring, and running the software, with specific recommendations and solutions for common issues. The building section advises on retrying builds from scratch, updating repository clones, and addressing specific errors such as missing `cargo` binaries. The configuring section suggests steps to resolve configuration errors, emphasizing the importance of using a consistent and valid `config.toml` file. The running section reiterates the need for consistency in configuration files between different commands. This document is essential for maintaining smooth operation and resolving issues efficiently within the Frankendancer codebase.
# Content Summary
The provided document is a troubleshooting guide for operators working with the Frankendancer software. It offers solutions for common issues encountered during the building, configuring, and running phases of the software.

### Building

- **General Recommendations**: Operators are advised to retry building from scratch by cloning the repository anew and following the instructions in the "Getting Started" guide. It is important to use a supported compiler and execute the `./deps.sh` script. When updating an existing repository, operators should update the Solana submodule after pulling the latest changes.

- **Specific Errors**: A common error involves the missing `cargo` binary from the Rust toolchain. This error is due to a race condition between installing and using the correct Rust toolchain version. The solution is to uninstall and reinstall the specified toolchain version using `rustup`.

### Configuring

- **General Recommendations**: If errors occur during the `fdctl configure init all` command, operators should run `fdctl configure fini all` to clear existing configurations and retry the `init` command. It is crucial to ensure that the `config.toml` file used is consistent across commands and contains valid TOML syntax. Operators should also pay attention to the command output for helpful error resolution suggestions.

### Running

- **General Recommendations**: Consistency in using the `~/config.toml` file across both `configure` and `run` commands is emphasized to avoid errors.

This guide is essential for operators to efficiently troubleshoot and resolve issues in the Frankendancer software, ensuring smooth building, configuring, and running processes.
