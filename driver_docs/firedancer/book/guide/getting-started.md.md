A guide for building, installing, and running the Frankendancer validator, including hardware requirements and configuration instructions.

# Purpose
This document provides a comprehensive guide for building, configuring, and running the Frankendancer validator, which is a hybrid of Firedancer and Agave code. The guide outlines the hardware requirements necessary to operate the validator, specifying both minimum and recommended configurations. It details the prerequisites for building Firedancer from source, including the necessary software tools and dependencies. The document also explains the process of installing dependencies using a script and provides instructions for building the Firedancer software, which includes components from the Agave validator. Configuration instructions are provided, including a sample `config.toml` file that specifies essential settings such as user, gossip entry points, consensus paths, and RPC settings. The guide also covers the initialization and running of the validator, emphasizing the need for specific Linux features and permissions. Additionally, it describes the networking setup using `AF_XDP` for high-performance networking and the associated privileges required.
# Content Summary
The document provides a comprehensive guide for building, installing, and running the Frankendancer validator, which is a hybrid of Firedancer and Agave code. The guide is structured into several sections, each detailing specific aspects of the setup and operation process.

### Key Sections and Details:

1. **Introduction to Frankendancer**:
   - Frankendancer is a validator that combines Firedancer and Agave components, replacing Agave's networking stack and block production for improved performance.
   - A full Firedancer validator is under development and not yet available.

2. **Hardware Requirements**:
   - Minimum and recommended hardware specifications are provided, emphasizing the need for high-performance CPUs, substantial RAM, and SSD storage.
   - The validator requires at least the hardware recommended for the Agave validator.

3. **Installation Prerequisites**:
   - Firedancer must be built from source on a Linux system with a recent kernel (v4.18 or higher).
   - Required tools include GCC (version 8.5 or higher), rustup, clang, git, and make.
   - Firedancer builds the Agave validator as a dependency, necessitating a full Rust toolchain.

4. **Building and Dependencies**:
   - Instructions for cloning the Firedancer repository and installing dependencies using a script are provided.
   - The build process requires significant memory (around 32GiB) and uses the `make` command to compile the necessary binaries.

5. **Releases and Versioning**:
   - Firedancer does not offer pre-built binaries; users must build from source.
   - The versioning system is explained, with major, minor, and patch numbers indicating different aspects of the release.

6. **Configuration and Running**:
   - Essential configuration options for running the validator on Testnet are outlined, including user settings, gossip entry points, consensus paths, and RPC settings.
   - The configuration file (`config.toml`) specifies user permissions and network settings.

7. **Permissions and Initialization**:
   - Details on user permissions required for running Firedancer, emphasizing the need for root access during initialization.
   - The `fdctl configure` command is used to automate system configuration, with a warning about potential permanent changes.

8. **Networking**:
   - Firedancer uses `AF_XDP` for high-performance networking, requiring specific privileges (`CAP_SYS_ADMIN` and `CAP_NET_RAW`).
   - The document notes that standard network monitoring tools may not capture traffic handled by `AF_XDP`.

This guide is essential for developers and operators who need to set up and manage the Frankendancer validator, providing detailed instructions on hardware requirements, installation, configuration, and operation.
