Instructions for setting up and developing the Firedancer book using VitePress and Bun.

# Purpose
The content provides instructions for setting up and developing a documentation site using VitePress. It begins by guiding the user to install `bun`, a JavaScript runtime, and ensures it is available in the system's `PATH`. The user must navigate to the `firedancer/book` directory before executing `bun install` to install dependencies. The command `bun run dev` starts the development server, allowing the user to view the documentation site locally. If the development is on a remote host, the user should run `bun run dev --host` to expose the site endpoint.
