Configuration for the Firedancer documentation site using VitePress with custom plugins and theme settings.

# Purpose
The file is a configuration file for VitePress, a static site generator. It defines the site settings for a project named "Firedancer." The configuration specifies the language as 'en-US', sets the site title and description, and includes metadata for the site's head, such as the favicon and theme color. It also configures the VitePress theme, including navigation and sidebar structure, which organizes the documentation into sections like 'Guide', 'API', and 'Internals'. Additionally, it integrates a plugin for version management and provides links for social media and editing the documentation on GitHub. The configuration ensures that the site is structured and styled according to the specified parameters, facilitating easy navigation and access to the documentation.
