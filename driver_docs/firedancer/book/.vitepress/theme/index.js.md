Imports and exports the default VitePress theme with custom CSS.

# Purpose
The code imports the default theme from `vitepress` and a custom CSS file named `custom.css`. It then exports the `DefaultTheme` as the default export of the module. This code provides narrow functionality by customizing the appearance of a VitePress site through CSS while maintaining the default theme settings. It acts as a configuration file for styling purposes in a VitePress project.
