CSS styles for table metrics, including font sizes, colors, and layout adjustments for dark and light themes.

# Purpose
The CSS styles define the appearance of a table with the class `metrics`. The styles set the font size and padding for table data cells, and specify the width and font properties for the first three columns of the table. The styles also define color and font weight for elements with the classes `metrics-name` and `metrics-enum`, with different color schemes for dark and non-dark themes. The use of CSS variables, such as `var(--vp-font-family-mono)`, allows for consistent styling across the application. These styles ensure that the table is visually organized and adapts to different themes.
