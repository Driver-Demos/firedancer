Describes the Firedancer security program, including bug bounty, third-party audits, and an audit contest.

# Purpose
The document outlines the security measures and programs associated with the Firedancer project. It includes a Bug Bounty Program where security-relevant bugs in Firedancer v0.1 can be reported through the Immunefi platform, potentially earning rewards for valid submissions. The document also details the involvement of third-party firms in conducting independent security audits, with the results made public once issues are resolved. Additionally, it describes an audit contest held on Immunefi, which took place before the mainnet launch of Firedancer v0.1, to further ensure the security of the project.
