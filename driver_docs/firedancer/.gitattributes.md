Configuration for Git to manage diff and linguist settings for specific file patterns.

# Purpose
The `.gitattributes` file specifies attributes for paths in a Git repository. It marks certain files and directories as generated or binary, affecting how Git handles them. The `-diff` attribute indicates that Git should not generate diffs for these files. The `linguist-generated=true` attribute is used to identify files as generated code, which can be useful for language statistics and code review tools. The `binary` attribute tells Git to treat the files as binary, which affects diff and merge behavior.
