# Purpose
This configuration file specifies compiler flags for building a software project. The `CompileFlags` section under `Add` lists preprocessor definitions and feature flags to be included during compilation, such as enabling specific source standards and optimizations. The conditional block under `If` applies additional compiler flags, such as warnings and standards, specifically to files with extensions `.h` or `.c`, ensuring strict code quality and security checks.
