# Purpose
This C header file, generated by a script named `generate_filters.py`, defines a seccomp (secure computing mode) filter policy for a specific execution environment. The file is not intended to be edited manually, as indicated by the comment at the top. It includes several Linux kernel headers related to auditing, capabilities, filtering, and seccomp, which are essential for defining and applying seccomp filters. The primary functionality of this file is to provide a predefined set of BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter) instructions that enforce security policies by restricting the system calls that a process can make, based on the architecture it is running on. The file supports multiple architectures, including i386, x86_64, and aarch64, and it will produce an error if an unsupported architecture is detected.

The core function, [`populate_sock_filter_policy_fd_exec_tile`](#populate_sock_filter_policy_fd_exec_tile), initializes a seccomp filter with a specific set of rules. These rules check the architecture of the running process and allow or deny certain system calls, such as `write` and `fsync`, based on predefined conditions. The filter uses BPF instructions to load and compare syscall numbers and arguments, and it either allows the syscall to proceed or terminates the process if the syscall does not meet the criteria. This file is part of a broader security mechanism, likely used in a larger application to enhance security by limiting the actions that can be performed by processes, thereby reducing the risk of exploitation through unauthorized system calls.

# Global Variables

---
### sock\_filter\_policy\_fd\_exec\_tile\_instr\_cnt
- **Type**: `unsigned int`
- **Description**: The variable `sock_filter_policy_fd_exec_tile_instr_cnt` is a constant unsigned integer set to the value 14. It represents the number of instructions in a socket filter policy used for seccomp (secure computing mode) filtering.
- **Use**: This variable is used to ensure that the output buffer in the `populate_sock_filter_policy_fd_exec_tile` function has enough space to hold the 14 instructions of the seccomp filter.


# Functions

---
### populate\_sock\_filter\_policy\_fd\_exec\_tile<!-- {{#callable:populate_sock_filter_policy_fd_exec_tile}} -->
The function `populate_sock_filter_policy_fd_exec_tile` initializes a seccomp filter to restrict system calls based on architecture and specific syscall numbers, copying the filter to a provided output buffer.
- **Inputs**:
    - `out_cnt`: The number of elements in the output buffer, which must be at least 14.
    - `out`: A pointer to a buffer of `struct sock_filter` where the filter will be copied.
    - `logfile_fd`: The file descriptor to be allowed for certain syscalls, specifically `write` and `fsync`.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if `out_cnt` is at least 14 using `FD_TEST` macro.
    - Define a `struct sock_filter` array `filter` with 14 elements to specify the seccomp filter rules.
    - Load the architecture from `seccomp_data` and compare it with `ARCH_NR`; if not equal, jump to `RET_KILL_PROCESS`.
    - Load the syscall number and check if it is `SYS_write` or `SYS_fsync`; if not, jump to `RET_KILL_PROCESS`.
    - For `SYS_write`, check if the first argument is 2 or `logfile_fd`; if not, jump to `RET_KILL_PROCESS`.
    - For `SYS_fsync`, check if the first argument is `logfile_fd`; if not, jump to `RET_KILL_PROCESS`.
    - If none of the conditions are met, the process is killed (`RET_KILL_PROCESS`).
    - If conditions are met, allow the syscall (`RET_ALLOW`).
    - Copy the `filter` array to the `out` buffer using `fd_memcpy`.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it populates the `out` buffer with the seccomp filter rules.
