# Purpose
This C header file, `fd_batch_tile_seccomp.h`, is a generated file that defines a seccomp (secure computing mode) filter policy using the Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF) syntax. The primary purpose of this file is to establish a security layer that restricts the system calls a process can make, thereby reducing the risk of malicious activities. The file includes several Linux headers related to auditing, capabilities, filtering, and seccomp, indicating its reliance on Linux-specific features. The code defines a static function, [`populate_sock_filter_policy_fd_batch_tile`](#populate_sock_filter_policy_fd_batch_tile), which initializes a BPF filter array with specific rules to allow or deny certain system calls based on the architecture and syscall numbers. The filter checks for compatibility with the runtime architecture and allows or denies syscalls like `write`, `fsync`, `fchmod`, `ftruncate`, `lseek`, `read`, and `readlink` based on predefined conditions.

The file is not intended to be edited manually, as indicated by the comment at the top, and is likely part of a larger system that uses Python scripts to generate such security policies. The seccomp filter is designed to be architecture-specific, with conditional compilation directives ensuring compatibility with supported architectures like i386, x86_64, and aarch64. The filter rules are structured to either allow the syscall to proceed or terminate the process if the syscall does not meet the specified criteria, enhancing the security posture of the application by preventing unauthorized system interactions.

# Global Variables

---
### sock\_filter\_policy\_fd\_batch\_tile\_instr\_cnt
- **Type**: `unsigned int`
- **Description**: The variable `sock_filter_policy_fd_batch_tile_instr_cnt` is a constant unsigned integer set to the value 51. It represents the number of instructions in a specific socket filter policy used for seccomp (secure computing mode) filtering.
- **Use**: This variable is used to ensure that the output buffer for the socket filter policy has enough space to accommodate all 51 instructions.


# Functions

---
### populate\_sock\_filter\_policy\_fd\_batch\_tile<!-- {{#callable:populate_sock_filter_policy_fd_batch_tile}} -->
The function `populate_sock_filter_policy_fd_batch_tile` initializes a seccomp filter with specific rules to allow or kill processes based on syscall checks and file descriptor arguments.
- **Inputs**:
    - `out_cnt`: The number of sock_filter structures that the output array can hold, expected to be at least 51.
    - `out`: A pointer to an array of sock_filter structures where the filter rules will be copied.
    - `logfile_fd`: A file descriptor for a log file, used in syscall checks to determine if certain syscalls should be allowed.
    - `tmp_fd`: A file descriptor for a temporary file, used in syscall checks to determine if certain syscalls should be allowed.
    - `tmp_inc_fd`: A file descriptor for a temporary incremental file, used in syscall checks to determine if certain syscalls should be allowed.
    - `full_snapshot_fd`: A file descriptor for a full snapshot file, used in syscall checks to determine if certain syscalls should be allowed.
    - `incremental_snapshot_fd`: A file descriptor for an incremental snapshot file, used in syscall checks to determine if certain syscalls should be allowed.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function begins by asserting that the output count is at least 51 using FD_TEST.
    - It initializes an array of 51 sock_filter structures with BPF instructions to check the architecture and syscall numbers.
    - The filter checks if the architecture matches the expected ARCH_NR; if not, it jumps to kill the process.
    - For each syscall (write, fsync, fchmod, ftruncate, lseek, read, readlink), it checks the syscall number and jumps to specific labels for further argument checks.
    - For each syscall, it loads the relevant syscall argument into the accumulator and compares it against the provided file descriptors.
    - If a match is found, it jumps to allow the syscall; otherwise, it continues to the next check or kills the process if no matches are found.
    - The function ends by copying the initialized filter array into the output array using fd_memcpy.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it populates the provided output array with the seccomp filter rules.
