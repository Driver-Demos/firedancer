# Purpose
This script is a shell executable designed to configure and launch an instance of the Agave validator, which is likely part of a blockchain or distributed ledger system. It sets up several environment variables, such as the primary IP address, gossip port, and shred version, which are crucial for the validator's network communication and operation. The script also specifies paths to necessary files, such as the ledger directory and keypair JSON files, which are essential for the validator's identity and voting capabilities. Additionally, it includes a command to remove a protobuf log file, indicating a cleanup step before starting the validator. The script is tailored for a specific version of Agave, suggesting it is intended for a narrow use case, possibly for testing or development purposes, rather than broad deployment.
# Global Variables

---
### PRIMARY\_IP
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: The `PRIMARY_IP` variable is a global string variable that holds the IP address '147.75.87.225'. This IP address is used as the gossip host in the Agave validator command.
- **Use**: This variable is used to specify the IP address for the gossip host in the Agave validator command.


---
### GOSSIP\_PORT
- **Type**: `integer`
- **Description**: GOSSIP_PORT is a global variable that holds the port number used for the gossip protocol in the Agave validator setup. It is set to 8001, which is the port through which the validator communicates with other nodes in the network.
- **Use**: This variable is used to specify the port for the gossip protocol when starting the Agave validator.


---
### SHRED\_VERSION
- **Type**: `integer`
- **Description**: `SHRED_VERSION` is a global variable that holds the version number of the shred protocol used by the Agave validator. It is set to the integer value 16013, which likely corresponds to a specific version of the protocol that the validator expects to interact with.
- **Use**: This variable is used to specify the expected shred version when running the Agave validator, ensuring compatibility with the network protocol.


---
### LEDGER
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: The `LEDGER` variable is a global string variable that specifies the path to the ledger directory used by the Agave application. It is set to './ledger-local', indicating a relative path to the directory where ledger data is stored locally.
- **Use**: This variable is used to define the location of the ledger data for the Agave validator process.


---
### VOTE\_ACCT
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: The `VOTE_ACCT` variable is a global string variable that holds the filename of a JSON file, specifically 'fd-vote-keypair.json'. This file is likely used to store the keypair for a voting account in a blockchain or distributed ledger system.
- **Use**: This variable is used to specify the path to the voting account keypair file, which is then utilized by the `solana-keygen pubkey` command to retrieve the public key for the vote account.


---
### IDENTITY
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: The `IDENTITY` variable is a global string variable that holds the filename of the identity keypair JSON file, specifically 'fd-identity-keypair.json'. This file is likely used to authenticate or identify the validator node in the Agave network.
- **Use**: This variable is used to specify the identity keypair file for the Agave validator process.


---
### WEN\_RESTART\_COORDINATOR
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: The `WEN_RESTART_COORDINATOR` is a global variable that holds a string value representing a unique identifier or address, likely used to specify a coordinator or node in a network or distributed system. This identifier is used in the context of restarting a process or service, as indicated by its name and usage in the script.
- **Use**: This variable is used as a parameter in the command to run the `agave-validator`, specifically to set the `--wen-restart-coordinator` option, which likely designates the coordinator for the restart process.


---
### WEN\_RESTART\_PROTOBUF\_LOG
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: The `WEN_RESTART_PROTOBUF_LOG` variable is a string that specifies the file path to the log file used for tracking the progress of a restart operation. It is set to './restart/restart_progress', indicating that the log file is located in the 'restart' directory relative to the current working directory.
- **Use**: This variable is used to define the location of the protobuf log file for the restart process, which is then passed as an argument to the `agave-validator` command.
