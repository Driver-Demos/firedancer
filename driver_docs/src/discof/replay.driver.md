## Folders
- **[generated](replay/generated.driver.md)**: The `generated` folder in the `firedancer` codebase contains a single generated header file, `fd_replay_tile_seccomp.h`, which defines a seccomp filter policy for syscall filtering.

## Files
- **[fd_epoch_forks.c](replay/fd_epoch_forks.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_epoch_forks.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase implements functions for managing epoch forks, including creating, publishing, preparing, and retrieving epoch context for forks within a distributed system.
- **[fd_epoch_forks.h](replay/fd_epoch_forks.h.driver.md)**: The `fd_epoch_forks.h` file defines structures and functions for managing epoch forks in a blockchain context, including initializing fork elements, publishing forks, preparing new epoch forks, and retrieving the correct epoch context.
- **[fd_exec.c](replay/fd_exec.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_exec.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase provides functions for managing and parsing execution slices, transactions, and microblocks within a replay context.
- **[fd_exec.h](replay/fd_exec.h.driver.md)**: The `fd_exec.h` file in the `firedancer` codebase defines structures and functions for managing and generating execution messages related to stake weights, replay execution, and hash banks, as well as providing execution tracking helpers for processing slices, transactions, and microblocks.
- **[fd_replay.c](replay/fd_replay.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_replay.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase appears to handle the replaying of transactions and microblocks, including consensus decisions, transaction execution, and publishing to a Proof of History (PoH) system.
- **[fd_replay.h](replay/fd_replay.h.driver.md)**: The `fd_replay.h` file in the `firedancer` codebase provides APIs and data structures for orchestrating the replay of blocks received from a cluster, including handling forward-error-correction sets and managing replayable slices of blocks.
- **[fd_replay_notif.h](replay/fd_replay_notif.h.driver.md)**: The `fd_replay_notif.h` file defines a data structure for messages passed through the replay notification link, including details such as slot execution information and message type, in the `firedancer` codebase.
- **[fd_replay_tile.c](replay/fd_replay_tile.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_replay_tile.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase implements the replay tile functionality, which involves managing the execution of transactions, handling snapshots, and coordinating with other components like exec and writer tiles, while also managing various states and metrics related to the replay process.
- **[fd_replay_tile.seccomppolicy](replay/fd_replay_tile.seccomppolicy.driver.md)**: The `fd_replay_tile.seccomppolicy` file in the `firedancer` codebase defines security policies for logging and blockstore operations, specifying file descriptor permissions for writing, syncing, reading, and seeking.
- **[Local.mk](replay/Local.mk.driver.md)**: The `Local.mk` file in the `firedancer` codebase specifies the inclusion of headers and objects for the replay functionality, with conditional checks for `INT128`, `SSE`, and `ZSTD` support.
- **[test_epoch_forks.c](replay/test_epoch_forks.c.driver.md)**: The `test_epoch_forks.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase appears to be a test file that initializes and halts the Firedancer environment using `fd_boot` and `fd_halt` functions.
