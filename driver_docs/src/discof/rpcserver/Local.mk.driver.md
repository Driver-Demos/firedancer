# Purpose
This file is a Makefile snippet used for conditional compilation in a software build process. It checks for the presence of `FD_HAS_INT128` and `FD_HAS_SSE` flags, and if both are defined, it adds specific headers and object files to the build, and defines a unit test for `test_rpc_keywords`. A fuzz test for `fuzz_json_lex` is also present but commented out.
