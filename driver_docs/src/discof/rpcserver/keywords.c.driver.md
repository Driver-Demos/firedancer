# Purpose
This C source file is a generated code file that provides functionality for keyword recognition and mapping within a web server context, specifically for JSON and RPC methods. The primary function, [`fd_webserver_json_keyword`](#fd_webserver_json_keyword), takes a keyword and its size as input and uses a series of switch-case statements to match the keyword against a predefined set of keywords. These keywords are associated with various JSON and RPC method identifiers, which are returned as long integer constants. The function uses bitwise operations to efficiently compare the input keyword with the stored keywords, which are encoded as hexadecimal values for quick matching.

Additionally, the file includes a reverse mapping function, [`un_fd_webserver_json_keyword`](#un_fd_webserver_json_keyword), which takes an identifier and returns the corresponding keyword as a string. This function is useful for converting internal identifiers back to human-readable keyword strings. The file is intended to be used as part of a larger system where JSON and RPC method keywords need to be quickly identified and processed, such as in a web server handling JSON-RPC requests. The file is not meant to be edited directly, as it is generated by another program (`genkeywords.cxx`), indicating that it is part of an automated build or code generation process.

# Functions

---
### fd\_webserver\_json\_keyword<!-- {{#callable:fd_webserver_json_keyword}} -->
The `fd_webserver_json_keyword` function maps a given keyword string to a corresponding predefined keyword identifier based on its length and content.
- **Inputs**:
    - `keyw`: A pointer to a constant character array representing the keyword string to be matched.
    - `keyw_sz`: An unsigned long integer representing the size of the keyword string.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function uses a switch statement to handle different cases based on the length of the keyword string (`keyw_sz`).
    - For each case, it checks specific conditions using bitwise operations to match the keyword string against known keywords.
    - If a match is found, the function returns a predefined keyword identifier corresponding to the matched keyword.
    - If no match is found for the given length, the function returns `KEYW_UNKNOWN`.
- **Output**: A long integer representing the identifier of the matched keyword, or `KEYW_UNKNOWN` if no match is found.


---
### un\_fd\_webserver\_json\_keyword<!-- {{#callable:un_fd_webserver_json_keyword}} -->
The function `un_fd_webserver_json_keyword` maps a given keyword identifier to its corresponding JSON keyword string.
- **Inputs**:
    - `id`: A long integer representing the keyword identifier.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function uses a switch statement to match the input `id` against a series of predefined cases, each corresponding to a specific keyword identifier.
    - For each case, the function returns a string literal representing the JSON keyword associated with the matched identifier.
    - If the `id` does not match any of the predefined cases, the function returns the string "???" as a default case.
- **Output**: A constant character pointer to the string representing the JSON keyword corresponding to the input identifier, or "???" if no match is found.
