# Purpose
The provided content appears to be a configuration file that defines a set of keywords and their corresponding identifiers, likely used for a JSON-RPC (Remote Procedure Call) interface within a blockchain or distributed ledger system. This file provides narrow functionality, specifically mapping JSON-RPC method names and parameters to internal constants or keys, which are used to facilitate communication between clients and the server. The file is organized into several conceptual categories, including JSON-RPC methods, WebSocket subscription methods, and various parameters related to blockchain operations such as transactions, blocks, and accounts. The relevance of this file to a codebase lies in its role as a centralized reference for method and parameter identifiers, ensuring consistency and reducing the risk of errors in the implementation of RPC calls and WebSocket subscriptions.
# Content Summary
The provided content appears to be a mapping of JSON-RPC and WebSocket method names to their corresponding keyword identifiers within a software codebase. This file is crucial for developers working with a system that interacts with a blockchain or distributed ledger technology, as it outlines the available methods for querying and interacting with the network.

Key technical details include:

1. **JSON-RPC Methods**: These are standard methods used to interact with the blockchain. They include methods for retrieving account information (`getAccountInfo`), balance (`getBalance`), block details (`getBlock`, `getBlockCommitment`), transaction details (`getTransaction`, `getTransactionCount`), and more. Each method is associated with a specific keyword identifier, such as `KEYW_RPCMETHOD_GETACCOUNTINFO`, which likely serves as a constant or reference within the codebase.

2. **WebSocket Methods**: These methods facilitate real-time updates and subscriptions to various blockchain events. They include methods for subscribing and unsubscribing to account changes (`accountSubscribe`, `accountUnsubscribe`), block updates (`blockSubscribe`, `blockUnsubscribe`), logs (`logsSubscribe`, `logsUnsubscribe`), and more. Each WebSocket method is similarly mapped to a keyword identifier, such as `KEYW_WS_METHOD_ACCOUNTSUBSCRIBE`.

3. **Parameters and Configuration Options**: The file also lists various parameters and configuration options, such as `jsonrpc`, `id`, `method`, `params`, and others like `commitment`, `encoding`, and `filters`. These parameters are essential for constructing requests and handling responses within the JSON-RPC framework.

4. **Transaction and Block Management**: The file includes methods for managing transactions (`sendTransaction`, `simulateTransaction`) and blocks (`getBlock`, `getBlockTime`). These methods are critical for developers who need to interact with the blockchain to send transactions or retrieve block data.

5. **Subscription Management**: The WebSocket methods provide a mechanism for developers to subscribe to and receive updates on specific blockchain events, which is vital for applications that require real-time data.

Overall, this file serves as a comprehensive reference for developers to understand the available methods and their corresponding identifiers, enabling efficient interaction with the blockchain network through both JSON-RPC and WebSocket protocols.
