# Purpose
This C header file is a generated source file that defines a seccomp (secure computing mode) filter policy for a specific application, likely related to an RPC server. The file is not intended to be edited manually, as indicated by the comment at the top. It includes several Linux kernel headers necessary for defining and working with seccomp filters, such as `linux/seccomp.h` and `linux/filter.h`. The primary functionality of this file is to set up a Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF) program that enforces a security policy by allowing or denying specific system calls based on predefined criteria. This is achieved through a series of BPF statements and jumps that check the architecture and syscall numbers, as well as syscall arguments, to determine whether to allow or kill the process making the syscall.

The file defines a function, [`populate_sock_filter_policy_fd_rpcserv_tile`](#populate_sock_filter_policy_fd_rpcserv_tile), which initializes a `sock_filter` array with 47 instructions. These instructions form a BPF program that checks the architecture and various system calls such as `write`, `fsync`, `accept4`, `read`, `sendto`, `close`, `poll`, and `lseek`. The checks are based on syscall numbers and arguments, and the program either allows the syscall or terminates the process if the syscall does not meet the specified criteria. This seccomp filter is designed to enhance security by restricting the syscalls that the application can execute, thereby reducing the attack surface. The file is part of a larger codebase, likely serving as a security component for an RPC server, and is intended to be included in other C source files where this security policy is required.

# Global Variables

---
### sock\_filter\_policy\_fd\_rpcserv\_tile\_instr\_cnt
- **Type**: `unsigned int`
- **Description**: The variable `sock_filter_policy_fd_rpcserv_tile_instr_cnt` is a constant unsigned integer set to the value 47. It represents the number of instructions in a socket filter policy used for seccomp (secure computing mode) filtering.
- **Use**: This variable is used to ensure that the output buffer for the socket filter policy has enough space to accommodate all 47 instructions.


# Functions

---
### populate\_sock\_filter\_policy\_fd\_rpcserv\_tile<!-- {{#callable:populate_sock_filter_policy_fd_rpcserv_tile}} -->
The function `populate_sock_filter_policy_fd_rpcserv_tile` initializes a seccomp filter to restrict system calls based on specific conditions and copies it to the provided output buffer.
- **Inputs**:
    - `out_cnt`: The number of elements in the output buffer, which must be at least 47.
    - `out`: A pointer to an array of `sock_filter` structures where the filter will be copied.
    - `logfile_fd`: The file descriptor for the log file, used in syscall checks.
    - `rpcserv_socket_fd`: The file descriptor for the RPC server socket, used in syscall checks.
    - `blockstore_fd`: The file descriptor for the blockstore, used in syscall checks.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function begins by asserting that `out_cnt` is at least 47 using `FD_TEST`.
    - A static array `filter` of 47 `sock_filter` structures is defined to specify the seccomp filter rules.
    - The filter first checks if the architecture of the script matches the runtime architecture, jumping to `RET_KILL_PROCESS` if not.
    - It then loads the syscall number and checks against a list of allowed syscalls (`write`, `fsync`, `accept4`, `read`, `sendto`, `close`, `poll`, `lseek`).
    - For each allowed syscall, additional checks are performed on syscall arguments to determine if the syscall should be allowed or if the process should be killed.
    - The filter ends with a default action to kill the process if none of the conditions are met.
    - Finally, the filter is copied to the output buffer using `fd_memcpy`.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it populates the `out` buffer with the seccomp filter rules.
