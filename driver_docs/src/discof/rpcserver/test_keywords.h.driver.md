# Purpose
The provided code is a test function named `test_fd_webserver_json_keyword`, designed to validate the behavior of the `fd_webserver_json_keyword` function, which is likely part of a web server or JSON processing library. Its primary purpose is to ensure that this function correctly identifies specific JSON keywords, returning appropriate constants for recognized keywords and `KEYW_UNKNOWN` for unrecognized or malformed inputs. The test cases cover a range of scenarios, including valid keywords, keywords with extra or incorrect characters, and various RPC and WebSocket methods, indicating its relevance to systems processing JSON-RPC or WebSocket requests, possibly in a blockchain or distributed ledger context. This code is part of a larger testing suite, serving as an internal validation tool to ensure the robustness and correctness of the keyword recognition logic, contributing to the overall quality assurance process by verifying the function's behavior under diverse conditions. It is not intended as a public API or library but rather as a development tool to maintain the integrity of the web server's request handling.

### test\_fd\_webserver\_json\_keyword<!-- {{#callable:test_fd_webserver_json_keyword}} -->
The function `test_fd_webserver_json_keyword` tests the `fd_webserver_json_keyword` function by asserting its output against expected keyword constants for various input strings.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function contains a series of `assert` statements that call `fd_webserver_json_keyword` with different string inputs and lengths.
    - Each `assert` checks if the return value of `fd_webserver_json_keyword` matches the expected keyword constant or `KEYW_UNKNOWN`.
    - The test cases include valid keywords, invalid keywords with extra characters, and partial keywords to ensure correct identification.
- **Output**: The function does not return any value; it uses assertions to validate the behavior of `fd_webserver_json_keyword`.
