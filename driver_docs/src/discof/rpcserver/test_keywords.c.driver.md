# Purpose
This C source code file is a simple test driver for a function named `test_fd_webserver_json_keyword`, which is likely defined in the included "test_keywords.h" header file. The program includes standard headers for assertions, size definitions, and input/output operations, indicating that it may perform some checks or output results. The [`main`](#main) function suppresses unused parameter warnings by casting `argc` and `argv` to void, and it calls the test function to presumably validate some aspect of JSON keyword handling in a web server context. Upon successful execution of the test, it prints "test passed!" to the standard output, signaling that the test has completed without errors.

# Functions

---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function serves as the entry point for the program, executing a test function and printing a success message.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The count of command-line arguments passed to the program.
    - `argv`: An array of strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function begins by explicitly ignoring the `argc` and `argv` parameters, indicating they are not used in this function.
    - It calls the `test_fd_webserver_json_keyword()` function, which is assumed to perform some kind of test related to JSON keywords in a web server context.
    - After the test function is executed, it prints 'test passed!' to the standard output.
    - Finally, the function returns 0, indicating successful execution.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer value of 0, which is a standard convention to indicate successful execution of a program.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`test_fd_webserver_json_keyword`](test_keywords.h.driver.md#test_fd_webserver_json_keyword)
