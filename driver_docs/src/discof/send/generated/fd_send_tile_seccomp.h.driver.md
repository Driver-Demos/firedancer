# Purpose
This C header file, `fd_send_tile_seccomp.h`, is a generated file that defines a seccomp (secure computing mode) filter policy for a specific application. The primary purpose of this file is to provide a predefined set of rules that restrict the system calls an application can make, enhancing security by limiting the potential attack surface. The file includes necessary headers for working with seccomp and BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter) and defines architecture-specific constants to ensure compatibility with the runtime environment. The seccomp filter is implemented using a series of BPF instructions that check the architecture and syscall numbers, allowing only specific syscalls (`write` and `fsync`) under certain conditions, while terminating the process if any other syscalls are attempted.

The file is not intended to be edited manually, as indicated by the comment at the top, and is likely part of a larger system where security is a concern. The function [`populate_sock_filter_policy_fd_send_tile`](#populate_sock_filter_policy_fd_send_tile) is the core component, which populates a `sock_filter` array with the BPF instructions that define the seccomp policy. This function ensures that only syscalls with specific arguments are allowed, using conditional jumps to either allow or kill the process based on the syscall and its arguments. The file is designed to be included in other C source files, providing a reusable and consistent security policy across different parts of the application.

# Global Variables

---
### sock\_filter\_policy\_fd\_send\_tile\_instr\_cnt
- **Type**: `unsigned int`
- **Description**: The variable `sock_filter_policy_fd_send_tile_instr_cnt` is a static constant of type `unsigned int` with a value of 14. It represents the number of instructions in a socket filter policy used for seccomp filtering.
- **Use**: This variable is used to ensure that the output buffer in the `populate_sock_filter_policy_fd_send_tile` function has enough space to hold the 14 instructions of the seccomp filter.


# Functions

---
### populate\_sock\_filter\_policy\_fd\_send\_tile<!-- {{#callable:populate_sock_filter_policy_fd_send_tile}} -->
The function `populate_sock_filter_policy_fd_send_tile` initializes a seccomp filter to restrict system calls based on architecture and specific syscall numbers, copying the filter to a provided output buffer.
- **Inputs**:
    - `out_cnt`: The number of elements in the output buffer, which must be at least 14.
    - `out`: A pointer to a buffer of `struct sock_filter` where the filter will be copied.
    - `logfile_fd`: The file descriptor to be allowed for certain syscalls, specifically `write` and `fsync`.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if `out_cnt` is at least 14 using `FD_TEST` macro.
    - Define a `struct sock_filter` array `filter` with 14 elements to specify the seccomp filter rules.
    - Load the architecture from `seccomp_data` and compare it with `ARCH_NR`; if not equal, jump to `RET_KILL_PROCESS`.
    - Load the syscall number and check if it is `SYS_write` or `SYS_fsync`; if not, jump to `RET_KILL_PROCESS`.
    - For `SYS_write`, check if the first argument is 2 or `logfile_fd`; if not, jump to `RET_KILL_PROCESS`.
    - For `SYS_fsync`, check if the first argument is `logfile_fd`; if not, jump to `RET_KILL_PROCESS`.
    - If none of the conditions are met, the process is killed (`RET_KILL_PROCESS`).
    - If conditions are met, allow the syscall (`RET_ALLOW`).
    - Copy the `filter` array to the `out` buffer using `fd_memcpy`.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it modifies the `out` buffer in place.
