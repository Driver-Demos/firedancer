## Files
- **[fd_forest.c](forest/fd_forest.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_forest.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase implements a data structure for managing a forest of elements, including functions for creating, joining, deleting, and manipulating elements within the forest, as well as printing the structure's ancestry, frontier, and orphaned elements.
- **[fd_forest.h](forest/fd_forest.h.driver.md)**: The `fd_forest.h` file in the `firedancer` codebase defines an API for managing and repairing blocks in a distributed system, using a tree structure to track block ancestry and a frontier to identify blocks needing repair.
- **[Local.mk](forest/Local.mk.driver.md)**: The `Local.mk` file in the `firedancer` codebase specifies build instructions for the `fd_forest` and unit tests for `test_forest` when `FD_HAS_INT128` is defined.
- **[test_forest.c](forest/test_forest.c.driver.md)**: The `test_forest.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase contains test functions for verifying the functionality of a forest data structure, including setup, publishing, and handling out-of-order data shreds, as well as printing tree structures.
