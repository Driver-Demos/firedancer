# Purpose
This C header file, generated by a script named `generate_filters.py`, defines a seccomp (secure computing mode) filter policy for a specific application context, likely related to a replay or simulation environment given the naming conventions. The file is not intended to be edited manually, as indicated by the initial comment. It includes several Linux kernel headers related to auditing, capabilities, filtering, and seccomp, which are essential for defining and enforcing security policies at the system call level. The file is structured to be included in other C source files, providing a predefined seccomp filter that restricts the system calls an application can make, enhancing security by minimizing the attack surface.

The core functionality of this file is encapsulated in the [`populate_sock_filter_policy_fd_replay_tile`](#populate_sock_filter_policy_fd_replay_tile) function, which initializes a Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF) program. This program is designed to enforce a security policy by allowing or denying specific system calls based on their numbers and arguments. The filter checks the architecture and specific system calls like `write`, `fsync`, `read`, and `lseek`, allowing them only if they meet certain conditions, such as matching specific file descriptors (`logfile_fd` and `blockstore_fd`). If a system call does not match the allowed criteria, the filter defaults to killing the process, thereby preventing unauthorized operations. This file is a critical component for applications that require strict control over their interactions with the operating system, ensuring that only explicitly permitted actions are executed.

# Global Variables

---
### sock\_filter\_policy\_fd\_replay\_tile\_instr\_cnt
- **Type**: `unsigned int`
- **Description**: The variable `sock_filter_policy_fd_replay_tile_instr_cnt` is a constant unsigned integer set to the value 20. It represents the number of instructions in a socket filter policy used for replaying tile operations in a seccomp (secure computing mode) context.
- **Use**: This variable is used to define the size of the `filter` array in the `populate_sock_filter_policy_fd_replay_tile` function, ensuring that the array has the correct number of instructions for the seccomp filter.


# Functions

---
### populate\_sock\_filter\_policy\_fd\_replay\_tile<!-- {{#callable:populate_sock_filter_policy_fd_replay_tile}} -->
The function `populate_sock_filter_policy_fd_replay_tile` initializes a seccomp filter to restrict system calls based on architecture and specific file descriptors.
- **Inputs**:
    - `out_cnt`: The number of elements in the output filter array, expected to be at least 20.
    - `out`: A pointer to an array of `struct sock_filter` where the filter rules will be copied.
    - `logfile_fd`: The file descriptor for the logfile, used to allow specific syscalls.
    - `blockstore_fd`: The file descriptor for the blockstore, used to allow specific syscalls.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if `out_cnt` is at least 20 using `FD_TEST` macro.
    - Define a static array `filter` of `struct sock_filter` with 20 elements to hold the seccomp rules.
    - Load the architecture from `seccomp_data` and compare it with `ARCH_NR`; if not equal, jump to `RET_KILL_PROCESS`.
    - Load the syscall number and check if it matches `SYS_write`, `SYS_fsync`, `SYS_read`, or `SYS_lseek`; if not, jump to `RET_KILL_PROCESS`.
    - For each allowed syscall, load the first argument and compare it with `logfile_fd` or `blockstore_fd` as appropriate; if it matches, jump to `RET_ALLOW`, otherwise jump to `RET_KILL_PROCESS`.
    - Copy the `filter` array to the `out` array using `fd_memcpy`.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it populates the `out` array with seccomp filter rules.
