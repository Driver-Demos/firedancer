# Purpose
This code is a C header file that defines a data structure and associated constants for handling replay notifications in a system, likely related to blockchain or distributed ledger technology. The file includes necessary dependencies from other modules, specifically `fd_funk.h` and `fd_types.h`, which suggests it relies on external types and functions. The core of the file is the `fd_replay_notif_msg` structure, which is aligned to 64 bytes for performance reasons and contains fields relevant to a replay notification, such as parent, root, slot, and various hashes and counts. The file also defines constants for the message type (`FD_REPLAY_SLOT_TYPE`) and parameters for message handling, such as the maximum transmission unit (`FD_REPLAY_NOTIF_MTU`) and a depth value (`FD_REPLAY_NOTIF_DEPTH`), indicating the size and capacity of the notification system.
# Imports and Dependencies

- `../../flamenco/types/fd_types.h`


# Data Structures

---
### fd\_replay\_notif\_msg
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `slot_exec`: A union member containing a struct with various fields related to slot execution.
    - `type`: An unsigned integer representing the type of the notification message.
- **Description**: The `fd_replay_notif_msg` structure is designed to encapsulate notification messages related to slot execution in a replay system. It is aligned to 64 bytes for performance reasons and contains a union with a single struct member, `slot_exec`, which holds detailed information about a slot, including its parent, root, slot number, height, bank and block hashes, identity, transaction count, shred count, and timestamp. The `type` field is used to specify the type of notification message, allowing for differentiation between various message types within the system.

### fd\_replay\_notif\_msg\_t
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `slot_exec`: A union member containing a struct with various fields related to slot execution.
    - `type`: An unsigned integer representing the type of the replay notification message.
- **Description**: The `fd_replay_notif_msg_t` is a data structure used to pass messages through a replay notification link, aligned to 64 bytes for performance optimization. It contains a union with a single struct member `slot_exec`, which holds detailed information about a slot execution, including identifiers like `parent`, `root`, `slot`, and `height`, cryptographic hashes `bank_hash` and `block_hash`, a public key `identity`, and metrics such as `transaction_count`, `shred_cnt`, and a timestamp `ts`. The `type` field indicates the specific type of message being conveyed.
