# Purpose
This C source code file is a minimal program that initializes and finalizes a framework or library, likely related to the "fd" (possibly "framework daemon" or similar) system. It includes two header files, "fd_epoch_forks.h" and "fd_util.h," which suggests it might be part of a larger system dealing with epoch management or process forking utilities. The [`main`](#main) function calls `fd_boot`, which is presumably responsible for initializing the system or setting up necessary resources, and `fd_halt`, which likely cleans up or shuts down the system gracefully. The program's structure indicates it is designed to ensure proper startup and shutdown sequences, possibly for testing or as a template for more complex applications.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `fd_epoch_forks.h`
- `../../util/fd_util.h`


# Functions

---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function initializes the program environment and then terminates the program.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: An integer representing the number of command-line arguments passed to the program.
    - `argv`: An array of character pointers listing all the arguments passed to the program.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function begins by calling `fd_boot`, passing the addresses of `argc` and `argv` to initialize the program environment.
    - After initialization, the function calls `fd_halt` to perform any necessary cleanup or shutdown procedures.
    - Finally, the function returns 0, indicating successful execution.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer value of 0, indicating successful completion of the program.
