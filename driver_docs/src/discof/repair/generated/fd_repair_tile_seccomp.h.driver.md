# Purpose
This C header file, `fd_repair_tile_seccomp.h`, is a generated file that defines a seccomp (secure computing mode) filter policy for a specific application context, likely related to a repair or maintenance function within a larger system. The file is not intended to be edited manually, as indicated by the comment at the top, and is generated by a script named `generate_filters.py`. The primary purpose of this file is to set up a seccomp filter using Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF) instructions to restrict the system calls that a process can make, enhancing security by limiting the process's capabilities to only those that are explicitly allowed.

The file includes several Linux kernel headers necessary for defining and implementing seccomp filters, such as `<linux/seccomp.h>` and `<linux/filter.h>`. It defines a function, [`populate_sock_filter_policy_fd_repair_tile`](#populate_sock_filter_policy_fd_repair_tile), which initializes a BPF filter array with specific rules. These rules allow or deny system calls based on their number and arguments, such as `SYS_write`, `SYS_lseek`, `SYS_ftruncate`, `SYS_fsync`, and `SYS_read`. The filter checks the architecture to ensure compatibility and uses conditional jumps to either allow the syscall or terminate the process if the syscall is not permitted. This file is part of a broader security mechanism, ensuring that only specific, safe operations are performed by the process, thereby reducing the risk of exploitation through unauthorized system calls.

# Global Variables

---
### sock\_filter\_policy\_fd\_repair\_tile\_instr\_cnt
- **Type**: `unsigned int`
- **Description**: The variable `sock_filter_policy_fd_repair_tile_instr_cnt` is a constant unsigned integer set to the value 27. It represents the number of instructions in a socket filter policy used for seccomp (secure computing mode) filtering.
- **Use**: This variable is used to ensure that the output buffer for the socket filter policy has enough space to accommodate all 27 instructions.


# Functions

---
### populate\_sock\_filter\_policy\_fd\_repair\_tile<!-- {{#callable:populate_sock_filter_policy_fd_repair_tile}} -->
The function `populate_sock_filter_policy_fd_repair_tile` initializes a seccomp filter to restrict system calls based on specific conditions and copies it to the provided output buffer.
- **Inputs**:
    - `out_cnt`: The number of elements in the output buffer, which must be at least 27.
    - `out`: A pointer to an array of `struct sock_filter` where the filter will be copied.
    - `logfile_fd`: The file descriptor for the logfile, used in syscall checks.
    - `good_peer_cache_file_fd`: The file descriptor for the good peer cache file, used in syscall checks.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if `out_cnt` is at least 27, ensuring the output buffer is large enough.
    - Define a seccomp filter array with 27 instructions to restrict system calls based on architecture and syscall numbers.
    - Load the architecture from `seccomp_data` and compare it to the expected architecture; jump to kill process if they don't match.
    - Load the syscall number and check against allowed syscalls (`write`, `lseek`, `ftruncate`, `fsync`, `read`).
    - For each allowed syscall, further check the first argument against specific file descriptors (`logfile_fd`, `good_peer_cache_file_fd`) to determine if the syscall should be allowed or the process should be killed.
    - Copy the defined filter array to the output buffer using `fd_memcpy`.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it modifies the `out` buffer in place with the seccomp filter.
