# Purpose
The file `fd_resolv_tile.c` appears to be a C source file, likely part of a larger project related to DNS resolution or network communication, given the directory path `resolv`. The prefix `fd_` suggests it might be dealing with file descriptors, which are commonly used in network programming to manage connections or data streams. The term `tile` in the filename could indicate a modular or component-based approach, possibly handling a specific aspect or feature of the DNS resolution process. Without the actual content, it's challenging to provide more specific details, but this file likely contains functions or logic to manage or resolve network addresses or hostnames, potentially interfacing with other components in the `discoh` project.
