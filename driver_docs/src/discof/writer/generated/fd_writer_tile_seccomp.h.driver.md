# Purpose
This C header file, generated by a script named `generate_filters.py`, defines a seccomp (secure computing mode) filter policy for a specific application context, likely related to a component named "fd_writer_tile". The file is not intended to be edited manually, as indicated by the initial comment. It includes several Linux kernel headers related to auditing, capabilities, filtering, and seccomp, which are essential for defining and enforcing security policies at the system call level. The file is structured to be included in other C source files, providing a predefined seccomp filter that restricts the system calls an application can make, enhancing security by minimizing the attack surface.

The core functionality of this file is encapsulated in the [`populate_sock_filter_policy_fd_writer_tile`](#populate_sock_filter_policy_fd_writer_tile) function, which initializes a Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF) program. This program is designed to enforce a security policy by allowing only specific system calls (`SYS_write` and `SYS_fsync`) and terminating the process if any other system call is attempted. The filter checks the architecture to ensure compatibility and uses conditional jumps to either allow or kill the process based on the system call and its arguments. The use of seccomp and BPF in this context is a powerful method to sandbox applications, preventing them from executing potentially harmful operations. The file is tailored for specific architectures, as indicated by the conditional compilation directives, ensuring that the filter is only applied on supported systems.

# Global Variables

---
### sock\_filter\_policy\_fd\_writer\_tile\_instr\_cnt
- **Type**: `unsigned int`
- **Description**: The variable `sock_filter_policy_fd_writer_tile_instr_cnt` is a constant unsigned integer that holds the value 14. This value represents the number of instructions in a socket filter policy used for seccomp (secure computing mode) filtering.
- **Use**: This variable is used to ensure that the output buffer for the socket filter policy has enough space to accommodate all 14 instructions.


# Functions

---
### populate\_sock\_filter\_policy\_fd\_writer\_tile<!-- {{#callable:populate_sock_filter_policy_fd_writer_tile}} -->
The function `populate_sock_filter_policy_fd_writer_tile` initializes a seccomp filter to restrict system calls based on architecture and specific syscall numbers, copying the filter to a provided output buffer.
- **Inputs**:
    - `out_cnt`: The number of elements in the output buffer, which must be at least 14.
    - `out`: A pointer to an array of `struct sock_filter` where the filter will be copied.
    - `logfile_fd`: The file descriptor to be allowed for certain syscalls, specifically `write` and `fsync`.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if `out_cnt` is at least 14 using `FD_TEST` macro.
    - Define a `struct sock_filter` array `filter` with 14 elements to specify the seccomp rules.
    - Load the architecture from `seccomp_data` and compare it with `ARCH_NR`; if not equal, jump to `RET_KILL_PROCESS`.
    - Load the syscall number and check if it is `SYS_write`; if so, jump to `check_write`.
    - Check if the syscall number is `SYS_fsync`; if so, jump to `check_fsync`.
    - If none of the syscalls match, jump to `RET_KILL_PROCESS`.
    - In `check_write`, load the first syscall argument and check if it is 2; if so, allow the syscall, otherwise jump to `lbl_1`.
    - In `lbl_1`, load the first syscall argument again and check if it matches `logfile_fd`; if so, allow the syscall, otherwise jump to `RET_KILL_PROCESS`.
    - In `check_fsync`, load the first syscall argument and check if it matches `logfile_fd`; if so, allow the syscall, otherwise jump to `RET_KILL_PROCESS`.
    - Define `RET_KILL_PROCESS` to terminate the process if reached.
    - Define `RET_ALLOW` to allow the syscall if reached.
    - Copy the `filter` array to the `out` buffer using `fd_memcpy`.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value, but it populates the `out` buffer with a seccomp filter.
