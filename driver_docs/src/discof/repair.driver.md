## Folders
- **[generated](repair/generated.driver.md)**: The `generated` folder in the `firedancer` codebase contains a single generated header file, `fd_repair_tile_seccomp.h`, which defines a seccomp filter policy for managing system call permissions.

## Files
- **[fd_fec_chainer.c](repair/fd_fec_chainer.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_fec_chainer.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase implements functions for managing a Forward Error Correction (FEC) chainer, including creating, joining, leaving, deleting, initializing, finalizing, querying, and inserting elements into the FEC chainer structure.
- **[fd_fec_chainer.h](repair/fd_fec_chainer.h.driver.md)**: The `fd_fec_chainer.h` file in the `firedancer` codebase defines an API for managing and ordering Forward Error Correction (FEC) sets received asynchronously over a network, including handling forks, detecting protocol violations like equivocation, and ensuring in-order delivery to applications.
- **[fd_fec_repair.c](repair/fd_fec_repair.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_fec_repair.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase implements functions for managing and checking the completion of Forward Error Correction (FEC) repair processes, including creating, joining, leaving, and deleting FEC repair structures.
- **[fd_fec_repair.h](repair/fd_fec_repair.h.driver.md)**: The `fd_fec_repair.h` file in the `firedancer` codebase provides APIs and data structures for managing the repair of forward-error-correction (FEC) sets, including tracking and orchestrating the repair process for missing shreds within a cluster.
- **[fd_repair_tile.c](repair/fd_repair_tile.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_repair_tile.c` file implements the repair protocol for a Firedancer node, handling tasks such as packet sending, receiving, and processing, as well as managing repair requests and responses.
- **[fd_repair_tile.seccomppolicy](repair/fd_repair_tile.seccomppolicy.driver.md)**: The `fd_repair_tile.seccomppolicy` file in the `firedancer` codebase defines security policies for file operations related to logging and managing a cache of good repair peers, including rules for writing, seeking, truncating, syncing, and reading specific file descriptors.
- **[Local.mk](repair/Local.mk.driver.md)**: The `Local.mk` file in the `firedancer` codebase specifies the build configuration for the `discof` repair module, including object file additions and unit test setups, conditional on the presence of `FD_HAS_INT128` and `FD_HAS_SSE`.
- **[test_fec_chainer.c](repair/test_fec_chainer.c.driver.md)**: The `test_fec_chainer.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase contains test functions for verifying the functionality of the FEC chainer, including tests for FEC ordering and single FEC slot processing.
- **[test_fec_repair.c](repair/test_fec_repair.c.driver.md)**: The `test_fec_repair.c` file contains test functions for verifying the functionality of FEC (Forward Error Correction) repair and insertion processes within the Firedancer codebase.
