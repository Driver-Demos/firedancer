# Purpose
This snippet is from a Makefile, a build automation tool used to compile and link programs. It conditionally adds object files `fd_eqvoc_tile` and `fd_discof` to the build process if the `FD_HAS_SSE` flag is defined, indicating that the build should include support for SSE (Streaming SIMD Extensions) instructions.
