# Purpose
This C header file, `fd_eqvoc_tile_seccomp.h`, is a generated file that defines a seccomp (secure computing mode) filter policy for a specific application. The file is not intended to be edited manually, as indicated by the comment at the top. It includes several system and Linux-specific headers, such as `<linux/seccomp.h>` and `<linux/filter.h>`, which are necessary for defining and implementing seccomp filters. The primary functionality of this file is to provide a predefined set of BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter) instructions that enforce a security policy by restricting the system calls that a process can make. This is achieved through a static function, [`populate_sock_filter_policy_fd_eqvoc_tile`](#populate_sock_filter_policy_fd_eqvoc_tile), which populates a `sock_filter` array with instructions to allow or deny specific system calls based on the architecture and syscall number.

The file is structured to support multiple architectures, including i386, x86_64, and aarch64, by defining the appropriate `ARCH_NR` constant. The seccomp filter policy is implemented using a series of BPF statements and jumps that check the architecture and syscall numbers, allowing only specific syscalls like `SYS_write` and `SYS_fsync` under certain conditions. If the conditions are not met, the process is terminated using `SECCOMP_RET_KILL_PROCESS`. This file is part of a broader security mechanism, likely used in a larger application to enhance security by limiting the actions that can be performed by processes, thus reducing the risk of exploitation through unauthorized system calls.

# Global Variables

---
### sock\_filter\_policy\_fd\_eqvoc\_tile\_instr\_cnt
- **Type**: `unsigned int`
- **Description**: The variable `sock_filter_policy_fd_eqvoc_tile_instr_cnt` is a constant unsigned integer set to the value 14. It represents the number of instructions in a specific socket filter policy used for seccomp (secure computing mode) filtering.
- **Use**: This variable is used to ensure that the output buffer for the socket filter policy has enough space to accommodate all 14 instructions.


# Functions

---
### populate\_sock\_filter\_policy\_fd\_eqvoc\_tile<!-- {{#callable:populate_sock_filter_policy_fd_eqvoc_tile}} -->
The function `populate_sock_filter_policy_fd_eqvoc_tile` initializes a seccomp filter to restrict system calls based on architecture and specific syscall numbers, copying the filter to the provided output buffer.
- **Inputs**:
    - `out_cnt`: The number of elements in the output buffer, which must be at least 14.
    - `out`: A pointer to a buffer of `struct sock_filter` where the filter will be copied.
    - `logfile_fd`: The file descriptor to be allowed for certain syscalls, specifically `write` and `fsync`.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function begins by asserting that `out_cnt` is at least 14 using `FD_TEST` to ensure the output buffer is large enough.
    - A static array `filter` of 14 `struct sock_filter` elements is defined to specify the seccomp filter rules.
    - The filter first checks if the architecture of the running process matches the expected architecture (`ARCH_NR`); if not, it jumps to `RET_KILL_PROCESS`.
    - It then loads the syscall number and checks if it is `SYS_write` or `SYS_fsync`, jumping to specific labels for further checks or to `RET_KILL_PROCESS` if unmatched.
    - For `SYS_write`, it checks if the first argument is 2 (standard error) or matches `logfile_fd`, allowing the syscall if true, otherwise jumping to `RET_KILL_PROCESS`.
    - For `SYS_fsync`, it checks if the first argument matches `logfile_fd`, allowing the syscall if true, otherwise jumping to `RET_KILL_PROCESS`.
    - The filter ends with `RET_KILL_PROCESS` as the default action and `RET_ALLOW` for allowed syscalls.
    - Finally, the function copies the constructed filter to the `out` buffer using `fd_memcpy`.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it populates the `out` buffer with the seccomp filter rules.
