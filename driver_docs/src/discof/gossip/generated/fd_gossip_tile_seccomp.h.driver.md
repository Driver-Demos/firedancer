# Purpose
This C header file, `fd_gossip_tile_seccomp.h`, is a generated file that defines a seccomp (secure computing mode) filter policy for a specific application or component, likely related to a gossip protocol given the naming convention. The file is not intended to be edited manually, as indicated by the comment at the top. It includes several system and Linux-specific headers, such as those for seccomp, BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter), and syscall definitions, which are essential for setting up and managing the seccomp filters. The primary functionality of this file is to define a static function, [`populate_sock_filter_policy_fd_gossip_tile`](#populate_sock_filter_policy_fd_gossip_tile), which initializes a BPF filter array with specific rules to restrict the system calls that a process can make, enhancing security by limiting the attack surface.

The filter policy is architecture-specific, with conditional compilation directives to support different architectures like i386, x86_64, and aarch64. The filter rules are defined using BPF statements and jumps, which check the architecture and syscall numbers, allowing only specific syscalls like `write` and `fsync` under certain conditions. If the conditions are not met, the process is terminated using `SECCOMP_RET_KILL_PROCESS`. This file is part of a broader security mechanism, likely used in a larger application to enforce strict syscall policies, ensuring that only necessary and safe operations are permitted, thereby preventing unauthorized or potentially harmful actions.

# Global Variables

---
### sock\_filter\_policy\_fd\_gossip\_tile\_instr\_cnt
- **Type**: `unsigned int`
- **Description**: The variable `sock_filter_policy_fd_gossip_tile_instr_cnt` is a static constant of type `unsigned int` with a value of 14. It represents the number of instructions in a socket filter policy used for seccomp filtering.
- **Use**: This variable is used to ensure that the output buffer in the `populate_sock_filter_policy_fd_gossip_tile` function has enough space to hold the 14 filter instructions.


# Functions

---
### populate\_sock\_filter\_policy\_fd\_gossip\_tile<!-- {{#callable:populate_sock_filter_policy_fd_gossip_tile}} -->
The function `populate_sock_filter_policy_fd_gossip_tile` initializes a seccomp filter to restrict system calls based on architecture and specific syscall numbers, allowing only certain operations on specified file descriptors.
- **Inputs**:
    - `out_cnt`: The number of elements in the output filter array, which must be at least 14.
    - `out`: A pointer to an array of `struct sock_filter` where the filter rules will be copied.
    - `logfile_fd`: The file descriptor that is allowed for certain syscalls like `write` and `fsync`.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if `out_cnt` is at least 14, ensuring the output array can hold the filter rules.
    - Initialize a `struct sock_filter` array with 14 filter instructions.
    - The first instruction checks if the architecture of the running process matches the expected architecture; if not, it jumps to kill the process.
    - Load the syscall number and check if it is `SYS_write` or `SYS_fsync`; if not, jump to kill the process.
    - For `SYS_write`, check if the first argument is 2 (standard error) or matches `logfile_fd`; if not, jump to kill the process.
    - For `SYS_fsync`, check if the first argument matches `logfile_fd`; if not, jump to kill the process.
    - If any checks fail, the process is killed; otherwise, the syscall is allowed.
    - Copy the initialized filter array to the output array using `fd_memcpy`.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it populates the `out` array with seccomp filter rules.
