# Purpose
The provided content is a documentation guide for testing the "wen-restart" feature locally within a software environment involving two components: Firedancer and Agave. It outlines the necessary configuration and steps to ensure that both components can be restarted correctly after being terminated. The document specifies the required files and directories, such as identity and vote account keys, ledger directories, and specific configuration files like the funk file and tower checkpoint file. It also provides instructions for running scripts (`restart_fd.sh` and `restart_agave.sh`) to initiate the wen-restart mode for both Firedancer and Agave, emphasizing the importance of updating script variables and ensuring compatibility with specific software versions. The expectation is that both components will produce consistent snapshot files and logs, indicating successful synchronization and restart.
