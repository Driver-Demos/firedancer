## Folders
- **[generated](shred/generated.driver.md)**: The `generated` folder in the `firedancer` codebase contains a single generated header file, `fd_shred_tile_seccomp.h`, which defines a seccomp filter policy for managing system call permissions.

## Files
- **[fd_fec_resolver.c](shred/fd_fec_resolver.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_fec_resolver.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase implements a forward error correction (FEC) resolver that manages FEC sets, processes shreds, and handles Merkle tree and Reed-Solomon error correction operations.
- **[fd_fec_resolver.h](shred/fd_fec_resolver.h.driver.md)**: The `fd_fec_resolver.h` file in the `firedancer` codebase defines methods for building and validating Forward Error Correction (FEC) sets from received shreds, managing memory efficiently to handle different lifetime requirements for in-progress and completed FEC sets.
- **[fd_shred_dest.c](shred/fd_shred_dest.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_shred_dest.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase implements functions for managing and computing shred destinations, including handling staked and unstaked validators, using cryptographic operations and random sampling techniques.
- **[fd_shred_dest.h](shred/fd_shred_dest.h.driver.md)**: The `fd_shred_dest.h` file in the `firedancer` codebase defines methods and structures for determining the destination of shreds based on stake weights, implementing the Turbine tree logic for both leader and non-leader nodes.
- **[fd_shred_tile.c](shred/fd_shred_tile.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_shred_tile.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase implements a shred tile that processes shreds from both microblocks and network sources, managing flow control and memory segmentation to handle shreds and FEC sets for transmission to the blockstore and network.
- **[fd_shred_tile.seccomppolicy](shred/fd_shred_tile.seccomppolicy.driver.md)**: The `fd_shred_tile.seccomppolicy` file defines security policies for logging in the Firedancer codebase, specifying conditions for writing to and syncing log files and STDERR.
- **[fd_shredder.c](shred/fd_shredder.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_shredder.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase implements functions for managing and processing data shreds, including initialization, joining, leaving, deleting, and generating forward error correction (FEC) sets with Merkle proofs and signatures.
- **[fd_shredder.h](shred/fd_shredder.h.driver.md)**: The `fd_shredder.h` file in the `firedancer` codebase defines the interface and data structures for a shredder object that processes entry batches into data and parity shreds, including functions for initializing, processing, and finalizing shred batches.
- **[fd_stake_ci.c](shred/fd_stake_ci.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_stake_ci.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase implements functions for managing stake and shred destination information for validators, including initialization, updates, and identity management.
- **[fd_stake_ci.h](shred/fd_stake_ci.h.driver.md)**: The `fd_stake_ci.h` file in the `firedancer` codebase manages leader schedules and shred destinations across epoch boundaries, handling complexities related to stake delegation changes and providing functions for initializing, finalizing, and querying stake contact information.
- **[Local.mk](shred/Local.mk.driver.md)**: The `Local.mk` file in the `firedancer` codebase specifies the build and test configurations for various components related to shredding and error correction, conditional on the presence of certain features like `FD_HAS_INT128` and `FD_HAS_SSE`.
- **[test_fec_resolver.c](shred/test_fec_resolver.c.driver.md)**: The `test_fec_resolver.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase contains a series of tests for the FEC (Forward Error Correction) resolver functionality, including tests for batch processing, interleaved shreds, rolloff, new formats, shred version handling, rejection criteria, Merkle root verification, forced completion, and chained Merkle shreds.
- **[test_shred_dest.c](shred/test_shred_dest.c.driver.md)**: The `test_shred_dest.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase contains a series of tests for the `fd_shred_dest` functionality, including tests for conformance, varying stake and radix, batching, contact changes, indeterminate cases, and performance.
- **[test_shredder.c](shred/test_shredder.c.driver.md)**: The `test_shredder.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase contains a suite of tests for the `fd_shredder` functionality, including performance tests, batch processing, and validation of data and parity shreds.
- **[test_stake_ci.c](shred/test_stake_ci.c.driver.md)**: The `test_stake_ci.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase contains a series of tests for the `fd_stake_ci` module, focusing on stake message generation, destination checking, and various scenarios involving staked and unstaked nodes.
