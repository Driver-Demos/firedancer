# Purpose
This C header file, `fd_disco.h`, is part of a larger project and serves as an interface for defining and including various components related to network communication and data handling. It includes several other headers, such as `fd_stem.h`, `fd_metrics.h`, and `fd_pcap_replay.h`, which suggests it integrates functionalities for metrics collection, packet capture, and possibly other network-related operations. The file defines a packed structure, `fd_shred_dest_wire`, which is used to represent a network destination with fields for a public key, an IPv4 address, and a UDP port, indicating its role in network data transmission or reception. The use of `__attribute__((packed))` ensures that the structure is tightly packed, which is crucial for network communication where data alignment and size are critical. Overall, this header file is likely part of a network or communication module within a larger system, focusing on efficient data exchange and processing.
# Imports and Dependencies

- `../flamenco/types/fd_types_custom.h`


# Data Structures

---
### fd\_shred\_dest\_wire
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `pubkey`: An array of one fd_pubkey_t element representing the public key.
    - `ip4_addr`: An unsigned integer representing the IPv4 address in network byte order.
    - `udp_port`: An unsigned short integer representing the UDP port number.
- **Description**: The `fd_shred_dest_wire` structure is a packed data structure used to represent a network destination for shreds, consisting of a public key, an IPv4 address, and a UDP port. The structure is packed to ensure there is no padding between its members, which is crucial for network communication where data alignment and size must be consistent. The `ip4_addr` is stored in network byte order, indicating that it is ready for transmission over a network without further conversion.

### fd\_shred\_dest\_wire\_t
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `pubkey`: An array of one fd_pubkey_t, representing a public key.
    - `ip4_addr`: A 32-bit unsigned integer representing an IPv4 address in network byte order.
    - `udp_port`: A 16-bit unsigned short representing a UDP port number.
- **Description**: The `fd_shred_dest_wire_t` structure is a packed data structure used to represent a network destination for shreds, which includes a public key, an IPv4 address, and a UDP port. The structure is designed to be compact and is used in network communications, with the IPv4 address stored in network byte order to facilitate transmission over networks.
