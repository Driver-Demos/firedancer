# Purpose
This C header file, generated by a script named `generate_filters.py`, defines a seccomp (secure computing mode) filter policy for a deduplication tile in a software system. The file is not intended to be edited manually, as indicated by the comment at the top. It includes several Linux kernel headers related to auditing, capabilities, filtering, and seccomp, which are essential for defining and enforcing security policies at the system call level. The file is structured to be included in other C source files, providing a predefined set of seccomp rules that restrict the system calls a process can make, enhancing security by minimizing the attack surface.

The core functionality of this file is encapsulated in the [`populate_sock_filter_policy_fd_dedup_tile`](#populate_sock_filter_policy_fd_dedup_tile) function, which initializes a Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF) program. This program is designed to enforce a security policy by allowing or killing processes based on their system call behavior. The filter checks the architecture of the running process and allows only specific system calls (`write` and `fsync`) under certain conditions, such as matching file descriptors. If the conditions are not met, the process is terminated. This approach is crucial for applications that require strict control over their interactions with the operating system, ensuring that only safe and expected operations are performed.

# Global Variables

---
### sock\_filter\_policy\_fd\_dedup\_tile\_instr\_cnt
- **Type**: `unsigned int`
- **Description**: The variable `sock_filter_policy_fd_dedup_tile_instr_cnt` is a static constant of type `unsigned int` with a value of 14. It represents the number of instructions in a socket filter policy used for seccomp (secure computing mode) filtering.
- **Use**: This variable is used to ensure that the output buffer in the `populate_sock_filter_policy_fd_dedup_tile` function has enough space to hold the 14 instructions of the seccomp filter.


# Functions

---
### populate\_sock\_filter\_policy\_fd\_dedup\_tile<!-- {{#callable:populate_sock_filter_policy_fd_dedup_tile}} -->
The function `populate_sock_filter_policy_fd_dedup_tile` initializes a seccomp filter to restrict system calls based on architecture and specific syscall numbers, allowing only certain operations on specified file descriptors.
- **Inputs**:
    - `out_cnt`: The number of elements in the output filter array, which must be at least 14.
    - `out`: A pointer to an array of `struct sock_filter` where the filter rules will be copied.
    - `logfile_fd`: The file descriptor that is allowed for certain syscalls like `write` and `fsync`.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if `out_cnt` is at least 14 using `FD_TEST` macro.
    - Define a `struct sock_filter` array `filter` with 14 elements to hold the seccomp rules.
    - Load the architecture from `seccomp_data` and compare it with `ARCH_NR`; if not equal, jump to `RET_KILL_PROCESS`.
    - Load the syscall number and check if it is `SYS_write`; if so, jump to `check_write`.
    - Check if the syscall number is `SYS_fsync`; if so, jump to `check_fsync`.
    - If none of the syscalls match, jump to `RET_KILL_PROCESS`.
    - In `check_write`, load the first syscall argument and check if it is 2; if so, jump to `RET_ALLOW`, otherwise continue to `lbl_1`.
    - In `lbl_1`, load the first syscall argument again and check if it matches `logfile_fd`; if so, jump to `RET_ALLOW`, otherwise jump to `RET_KILL_PROCESS`.
    - In `check_fsync`, load the first syscall argument and check if it matches `logfile_fd`; if so, jump to `RET_ALLOW`, otherwise jump to `RET_KILL_PROCESS`.
    - Define `RET_KILL_PROCESS` to terminate the process if reached.
    - Define `RET_ALLOW` to allow the syscall if reached.
    - Copy the `filter` array to the `out` array using `fd_memcpy`.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it populates the `out` array with seccomp filter rules.
