# Purpose
This snippet is a conditional directive from a Makefile, used in build automation. It checks if the `FD_HAS_SSE` flag is defined, and if so, it adds object files `fd_dedup_tile` and `fd_disco` to the build process. The commented line suggests a unit test target for `test_dedup` that is not currently active, indicating it may be used for testing purposes when uncommented.
