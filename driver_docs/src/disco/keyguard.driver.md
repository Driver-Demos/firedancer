## Files
- **[fd_keyguard.h](keyguard/fd_keyguard.h.driver.md)**: The `fd_keyguard.h` file in the `firedancer` codebase defines constants, roles, payload types, and functions for creating digital signatures on behalf of validator components, including payload matching and authorization checks.
- **[fd_keyguard_authorize.c](keyguard/fd_keyguard_authorize.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_keyguard_authorize.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase implements functions for authorizing various types of payloads based on roles and signature types, including vote transactions, gossip messages, and bundle crank transactions.
- **[fd_keyguard_client.c](keyguard/fd_keyguard_client.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_keyguard_client.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase implements functions for creating a new keyguard client and signing data using shared memory and metadata caches.
- **[fd_keyguard_client.h](keyguard/fd_keyguard_client.h.driver.md)**: The `fd_keyguard_client.h` file defines a blocking client interface for interacting with a remote signing server using shared memory for secure communication in the `firedancer` codebase.
- **[fd_keyguard_match.c](keyguard/fd_keyguard_match.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_keyguard_match.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase implements logic to fingerprint and verify the authenticity of various signing requests to prevent "fake signing" attacks, ensuring that the keyguard only processes authorized requests.
- **[fd_keyload.c](keyguard/fd_keyload.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_keyload.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase provides functionality for securely loading, parsing, and managing validator identity keys from a file, including memory protection and error handling.
- **[fd_keyload.h](keyguard/fd_keyload.h.driver.md)**: The `fd_keyload.h` file in the `firedancer` codebase provides functions for reading, loading, unloading, and allocating protected memory pages for JSON-encoded keypairs, ensuring secure handling and storage of cryptographic keys.
- **[fd_keyswitch.c](keyguard/fd_keyswitch.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_keyswitch.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase provides functions for creating, joining, leaving, and deleting a `fd_keyswitch_t` structure, ensuring proper memory alignment and integrity through magic number checks.
- **[fd_keyswitch.h](keyguard/fd_keyswitch.h.driver.md)**: The `fd_keyswitch.h` file in the `firedancer` codebase provides APIs for managing the state and parameters of a keyswitch, including functions for creating, joining, leaving, deleting, and querying the state of a keyswitch.
- **[Local.mk](keyguard/Local.mk.driver.md)**: The `Local.mk` file in the `firedancer` codebase specifies the inclusion of headers and object files for the keyguard component, conditional on the presence of hosted and Linux environments, and includes a unit test for `test_keyload`.
- **[test_keyload.c](keyguard/test_keyload.c.driver.md)**: The `test_keyload.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase tests the functionality of protected memory pages allocation and access, including handling segmentation faults and verifying memory content after forking processes.
