# Purpose
This C header file, `sock_seccomp.h`, is a generated file that defines a seccomp (secure computing mode) filter policy for a socket-based application. The primary purpose of this file is to enhance the security of the application by restricting the set of system calls that the application can make, thereby reducing the potential attack surface. The file includes necessary headers for seccomp and BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter) operations and defines architecture-specific constants to ensure compatibility with different CPU architectures such as i386, x86_64, and aarch64. The core functionality is encapsulated in the [`populate_sock_filter_policy_sock`](#populate_sock_filter_policy_sock) function, which initializes a BPF program that enforces the seccomp policy.

The BPF program defined in this file consists of a series of instructions that check the architecture and syscall numbers against a predefined set of allowed syscalls, such as `poll`, `recvmmsg`, `sendmmsg`, `write`, and `fsync`. Each syscall is further validated based on specific arguments to ensure they meet the security criteria. If a syscall does not match the allowed criteria, the program will terminate the process using `SECCOMP_RET_KILL_PROCESS`. Otherwise, it allows the syscall to proceed with `SECCOMP_RET_ALLOW`. This file is intended to be included in other C source files where the seccomp policy needs to be applied, and it does not define any public APIs or external interfaces beyond the internal function for populating the filter.

# Global Variables

---
### sock\_filter\_policy\_sock\_instr\_cnt
- **Type**: `unsigned int`
- **Description**: The `sock_filter_policy_sock_instr_cnt` is a static constant unsigned integer that holds the value 35. This value represents the number of instructions in a socket filter policy used for seccomp (secure computing mode) filtering.
- **Use**: This variable is used to ensure that the output buffer in the `populate_sock_filter_policy_sock` function has enough space to hold all 35 instructions of the socket filter policy.


# Functions

---
### populate\_sock\_filter\_policy\_sock<!-- {{#callable:populate_sock_filter_policy_sock}} -->
The function `populate_sock_filter_policy_sock` initializes a seccomp BPF filter to enforce a security policy on socket operations by copying a predefined filter array into the provided output buffer.
- **Inputs**:
    - `out_cnt`: The number of elements in the output buffer, which must be at least 35.
    - `out`: A pointer to the output buffer where the seccomp BPF filter will be copied.
    - `logfile_fd`: The file descriptor for the log file, used in syscall checks.
    - `tx_fd`: The file descriptor for the transmission socket, used in syscall checks.
    - `rx_fd0`: The first file descriptor for the reception socket, used in syscall checks.
    - `rx_fd1`: The second file descriptor for the reception socket, used in syscall checks.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function begins by asserting that `out_cnt` is at least 35 to ensure the output buffer is large enough.
    - A static array `filter` of 35 `sock_filter` structures is defined, representing the seccomp BPF filter program.
    - The filter program first checks if the architecture of the running process matches the expected architecture, jumping to a kill process action if not.
    - It then loads the syscall number and checks against a list of allowed syscalls (`poll`, `recvmmsg`, `sendmmsg`, `write`, `fsync`).
    - For each allowed syscall, additional checks are performed on syscall arguments to determine if the syscall should be allowed or if the process should be killed.
    - If none of the syscalls match, the process is killed by default.
    - The filter array is copied into the provided output buffer using `fd_memcpy`.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it populates the provided `out` buffer with the seccomp BPF filter.
