# Purpose
This C header file, `xdp_seccomp.h`, is a generated file that defines a seccomp (secure computing mode) filter policy for use with eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter) and XDP (Express Data Path) in a Linux environment. The file is not intended to be edited manually, as indicated by the comment at the top. It includes several Linux kernel headers related to auditing, capabilities, filtering, and seccomp, which are essential for defining and enforcing security policies at the syscall level. The file is structured to be included in other C source files, providing a predefined seccomp filter that restricts the set of system calls a process can make, thereby enhancing security by minimizing the attack surface.

The core functionality of this file is encapsulated in the [`populate_sock_filter_policy_xdp`](#populate_sock_filter_policy_xdp) function, which initializes a `sock_filter` array with 45 instructions. These instructions form a BPF program that enforces a security policy by allowing or denying specific system calls based on their arguments. The policy checks the architecture of the executing environment and allows certain syscalls like `write`, `fsync`, `sendto`, `recvmsg`, and `getsockopt` under specific conditions, while defaulting to killing the process if the conditions are not met. This approach is typical in environments where security is paramount, such as in network packet processing with XDP, where minimizing the risk of malicious system calls is crucial.

# Global Variables

---
### sock\_filter\_policy\_xdp\_instr\_cnt
- **Type**: `unsigned int`
- **Description**: The variable `sock_filter_policy_xdp_instr_cnt` is a constant unsigned integer set to the value 45. It represents the number of instructions in a socket filter policy for XDP (eXpress Data Path).
- **Use**: This variable is used to ensure that the output count in the `populate_sock_filter_policy_xdp` function is at least 45, matching the number of instructions in the filter array.


# Functions

---
### populate\_sock\_filter\_policy\_xdp<!-- {{#callable:populate_sock_filter_policy_xdp}} -->
The function `populate_sock_filter_policy_xdp` initializes a seccomp BPF filter to enforce security policies on specific system calls for a given architecture.
- **Inputs**:
    - `out_cnt`: The number of elements in the output filter array, which must be at least 45.
    - `out`: A pointer to an array of `sock_filter` structures where the filter will be copied.
    - `logfile_fd`: The file descriptor for the log file, used in syscall checks.
    - `xsk_fd`: The file descriptor for the XDP socket, used in syscall checks.
    - `lo_xsk_fd`: The file descriptor for the loopback XDP socket, used in syscall checks.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function begins by asserting that `out_cnt` is at least 45 using `FD_TEST`.
    - A static array `filter` of 45 `sock_filter` structures is defined to hold the BPF instructions.
    - The filter checks if the architecture of the script matches the runtime architecture, jumping to `RET_KILL_PROCESS` if not.
    - It loads the syscall number and checks against allowed syscalls like `write`, `fsync`, `sendto`, `recvmsg`, and `getsockopt`.
    - For each allowed syscall, it further checks specific arguments to determine if the syscall should be allowed or the process should be killed.
    - The filter ends with instructions to either kill the process or allow the syscall, depending on the checks.
    - Finally, the function copies the `filter` array into the `out` array using `fd_memcpy`.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it populates the `out` array with the BPF filter instructions.
