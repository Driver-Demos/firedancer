# Purpose
This C source code file is designed to test the functionality of a circular queue (circq) implementation, likely provided by the `fd_circq` library. The file includes several test functions ([`test_simple1`](#test_simple1), [`test_simple2`](#test_simple2), [`test_simple3`](#test_simple3), and [`test_bounds`](#test_bounds)) that each exercise different aspects of the circular queue's behavior. These tests cover basic operations such as pushing and popping elements, handling edge cases, and ensuring the queue's capacity constraints are respected. The tests utilize a random number generator (`fd_rng`) to introduce variability in the operations, particularly in [`test_simple1`](#test_simple1) and [`test_simple3`](#test_simple3), which simulate more complex usage patterns.

The file serves as an executable test suite, as indicated by the presence of a [`main`](#main) function that sequentially calls each test function and logs the results. The [`main`](#main) function initializes the environment with `fd_boot` and concludes with `fd_halt`, suggesting that these functions are part of a larger framework or library that manages the lifecycle of the application. The use of `FD_TEST` and `FD_LOG_NOTICE` macros indicates a structured approach to testing and logging, ensuring that any failures in the circular queue operations are captured and reported. This file is not intended to be a reusable library or API but rather a standalone test application to verify the correctness and robustness of the circular queue implementation.

# Functions

### test\_simple1<!-- {{#callable:test_simple1}} -->
The function `test_simple1` tests the functionality of a circular queue by pushing a large number of randomly sized messages into it.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize a buffer `buf` with a size of 128 + 4096 bytes.
    - Create and join a circular queue `circq` using the buffer and a size of 128 bytes.
    - Check if the circular queue `circq` is successfully created using `FD_TEST`.
    - Initialize a random number generator `rng`.
    - Iterate 8192 * 8192 times, each time generating a random message size and pushing it to the back of the circular queue `circq`.
    - Check if each message is successfully pushed into the queue using `FD_TEST`.
- **Output**: The function does not return any value; it performs tests and assertions on the circular queue operations.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`fd_circq_join`](fd_circq.c.driver.md#fd_circq_join)
    - [`fd_circq_new`](fd_circq.c.driver.md#fd_circq_new)

### test\_simple2<!-- {{#callable:test_simple2}} -->
The function `test_simple2` tests the basic operations of a circular queue by pushing and popping messages and verifying their integrity.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize a buffer and create a circular queue using [`fd_circq_new`](fd_circq.c.driver.md#fd_circq_new) and [`fd_circq_join`](fd_circq.c.driver.md#fd_circq_join).
    - Push a message of size 8 with specific content ('X' and 'A') to the back of the queue using [`fd_circq_push_back`](fd_circq.c.driver.md#fd_circq_push_back).
    - Pop the message from the front of the queue using [`fd_circq_pop_front`](fd_circq.c.driver.md#fd_circq_pop_front) and verify its content using `FD_TEST`.
    - Attempt to pop additional messages from the empty queue and verify that they return `NULL`.
    - Push two messages to the queue, verify the queue count, and check the content of each message after popping them.
    - Push two more messages with different sizes and verify the content of the second message after popping.
- **Output**: The function does not return any value; it performs tests and assertions to verify the correct behavior of the circular queue operations.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`fd_circq_join`](fd_circq.c.driver.md#fd_circq_join)
    - [`fd_circq_new`](fd_circq.c.driver.md#fd_circq_new)

### test\_simple3<!-- {{#callable:test_simple3}} -->
The function `test_simple3` tests the functionality of a circular queue by performing a series of random push and pop operations.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize a buffer `buf` of size 1056 bytes and create a circular queue `circq` using this buffer with a capacity of 128.
    - Check if the circular queue `circq` is successfully created using `FD_TEST`.
    - Initialize a random number generator `rng` with a seed of 6.
    - Iterate 8192 times, and in each iteration, randomly decide whether to pop an element from the front of the queue with a 50% probability.
    - Push a new element to the back of the queue with a random size between 1 and 256 and a random value between 1 and 25.
- **Output**: The function does not return any value; it performs operations on the circular queue to test its behavior.
