# Purpose
This file is a Makefile script used for building and testing components of a software project. It adds header files and object files to the build process, specifically `fd_circq.h` and `fd_circq`, `fd_disco`. It also defines and executes a unit test named `test_circq`, which depends on several components: `fd_disco`, `fd_flamenco`, `fd_tango`, and `fd_util`.
