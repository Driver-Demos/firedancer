# Purpose
The provided content appears to be a Makefile, which is used to automate the build process of a software project. This specific section of the Makefile is conditional, executing only if certain features or capabilities, such as `FD_HAS_INT128`, `FD_HAS_SSE`, and `FD_HAS_HOSTED`, are available. It uses the `add-objs` function to add object files to the build process, indicating that these files are necessary for compiling certain components like `fd_shred_dest`, `fd_shredder`, and `fd_fec_resolver`. Additionally, it defines and runs unit tests for various components, ensuring that they function correctly. The use of conditional statements and function calls helps manage dependencies and test execution based on the system's capabilities, optimizing the build process for different environments.
