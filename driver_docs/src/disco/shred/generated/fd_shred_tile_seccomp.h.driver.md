# Purpose
This C header file, `fd_shred_tile_seccomp.h`, is a generated file that defines a seccomp (secure computing mode) filter policy for a specific application. The primary purpose of this file is to set up a BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter) program that restricts the system calls available to a process, enhancing security by allowing only a predefined set of system calls. The file includes necessary headers for seccomp and BPF operations and defines architecture-specific constants to ensure compatibility with the runtime environment. The seccomp filter is implemented as a static function, [`populate_sock_filter_policy_fd_shred_tile`](#populate_sock_filter_policy_fd_shred_tile), which populates a `sock_filter` array with instructions to enforce the policy.

The filter policy defined in this file is relatively narrow, focusing on allowing only specific system calls (`SYS_write` and `SYS_fsync`) under certain conditions, while all other calls result in the termination of the process (`SECCOMP_RET_KILL_PROCESS`). The filter checks the architecture of the running process to ensure it matches the expected architecture, and it uses conditional jumps to determine whether to allow or kill the process based on the syscall number and its arguments. This file is intended to be included in other C source files, providing a mechanism to apply a security policy that limits the operations a process can perform, thereby reducing the risk of exploitation through unauthorized system calls.

# Global Variables

---
### sock\_filter\_policy\_fd\_shred\_tile\_instr\_cnt
- **Type**: `unsigned int`
- **Description**: The variable `sock_filter_policy_fd_shred_tile_instr_cnt` is a static constant of type `unsigned int` with a value of 14. It represents the number of instructions in a specific socket filter policy used for seccomp (secure computing mode) filtering.
- **Use**: This variable is used to ensure that the output buffer in the `populate_sock_filter_policy_fd_shred_tile` function has enough space to hold the 14 instructions of the seccomp filter.


# Functions

---
### populate\_sock\_filter\_policy\_fd\_shred\_tile<!-- {{#callable:populate_sock_filter_policy_fd_shred_tile}} -->
The function `populate_sock_filter_policy_fd_shred_tile` initializes a seccomp filter to restrict system calls based on architecture and specific syscall numbers, copying the filter to the provided output buffer.
- **Inputs**:
    - `out_cnt`: The number of elements in the output buffer, which must be at least 14.
    - `out`: A pointer to a buffer of `struct sock_filter` where the filter will be copied.
    - `logfile_fd`: The file descriptor to be allowed for certain syscalls, specifically `write` and `fsync`.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if `out_cnt` is at least 14 using `FD_TEST` macro.
    - Define a `struct sock_filter` array `filter` with 14 elements to specify the seccomp filter rules.
    - Load the architecture from `seccomp_data` and compare it with `ARCH_NR`; if not equal, jump to `RET_KILL_PROCESS`.
    - Load the syscall number and check if it is `SYS_write` or `SYS_fsync`; if not, jump to `RET_KILL_PROCESS`.
    - For `SYS_write`, check if the first argument is 2 or `logfile_fd`; if not, jump to `RET_KILL_PROCESS`.
    - For `SYS_fsync`, check if the first argument is `logfile_fd`; if not, jump to `RET_KILL_PROCESS`.
    - If any check fails, the process is killed (`RET_KILL_PROCESS`); otherwise, allow the syscall (`RET_ALLOW`).
    - Copy the `filter` array to the `out` buffer using `fd_memcpy`.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it populates the `out` buffer with the seccomp filter rules.
