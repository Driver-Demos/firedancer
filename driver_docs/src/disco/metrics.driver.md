## Folders
- **[generate](metrics/generate.driver.md)**: The `generate` folder in the `firedancer` codebase contains scripts for handling metrics, including defining metric types, generating C code for metrics definitions, and creating documentation for these metrics.
- **[generated](metrics/generate.driver.mdd)**: The `generated` folder in the `firedancer` codebase contains a comprehensive collection of generated source and header files that define various metrics and seccomp filter policies for monitoring and enforcing security constraints across different components and operations, including network, transaction, and protocol activities.

## Files
- **[fd_metric_tile.c](metrics/fd_metric_tile.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_metric_tile.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase implements a Prometheus metrics endpoint using an HTTP server, with configurations for handling requests and managing server resources.
- **[fd_metric_tile.seccomppolicy](metrics/fd_metric_tile.seccomppolicy.driver.md)**: The `fd_metric_tile.seccomppolicy` file in the `firedancer` codebase defines security policies for logging and serving HTTP pages, specifying rules for file descriptor operations such as writing, reading, sending, and closing connections.
- **[fd_metric_tile_arm64.seccomppolicy](metrics/fd_metric_tile_arm64.seccomppolicy.driver.md)**: The `fd_metric_tile_arm64.seccomppolicy` file in the `firedancer` codebase defines security policies for ARM64 architecture, detailing file descriptor operations for logging and serving HTTP metrics, while noting the absence of the 'poll' syscall for ARM64.
- **[fd_metrics.c](metrics/fd_metrics.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_metrics.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase includes the `fd_metrics.h` header and declares thread-local pointers for metrics data.
- **[fd_metrics.h](metrics/fd_metrics.h.driver.md)**: The `fd_metrics.h` file in the `firedancer` codebase defines the layout and management of metrics in shared memory, providing macros and functions for efficiently reading, writing, and updating these metrics for both producers and consumers.
- **[fd_metrics_base.h](metrics/fd_metrics_base.h.driver.md)**: The `fd_metrics_base.h` file in the `firedancer` codebase defines macros and structures for handling different types of metrics, including gauges, counters, and histograms, along with their associated metadata and conversion types.
- **[fd_prometheus.c](metrics/fd_prometheus.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_prometheus.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase implements functions for rendering Prometheus metrics from a topology structure and serving them over HTTP.
- **[fd_prometheus.h](metrics/fd_prometheus.h.driver.md)**: The `fd_prometheus.h` file in the `firedancer` codebase provides functions to format and render metrics in the Prometheus text-based exposition format for a given topology and individual tiles into an HTTP server's outgoing ring buffer.
- **[gen_metrics.py](metrics/gen_metrics.py.driver.md)**: The `gen_metrics.py` file in the `firedancer` codebase reads and processes metrics from an XML file, then generates code and documentation based on those metrics.
- **[Local.mk](metrics/Local.mk.driver.md)**: The `Local.mk` file in the `firedancer` codebase specifies the headers and object files for the `disco/metrics` module, with conditional inclusion of additional objects if SSE support is enabled.
- **[Makefile](metrics/Makefile.driver.md)**: The `Makefile` in the `firedancer/src/disco/metrics` directory defines a `metrics` target that runs a Python script named `gen_metrics.py` using Python 3.
- **[metrics.xml](metrics/metrics.xml.driver.md)**: The `metrics.xml` file in the `firedancer` codebase defines a comprehensive set of metrics that can be collected and reported by Firedancer, organized into categories and ensuring backward compatibility by deprecating rather than altering existing metric names.
