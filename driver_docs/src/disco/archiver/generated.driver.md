- **[archiver_feeder_seccomp.h](generated/archiver_feeder_seccomp.h.driver.md)**: The `archiver_feeder_seccomp.h` file is a generated header file that defines a seccomp filter policy for the `firedancer` project, specifying rules to allow or kill processes based on system call checks.
- **[archiver_playback_seccomp.h](generated/archiver_playback_seccomp.h.driver.md)**: The `archiver_playback_seccomp.h` file in the `firedancer` codebase defines a seccomp filter policy for the archiver playback, allowing specific syscalls and killing the process for others based on architecture and syscall arguments.
- **[archiver_writer_seccomp.h](generated/archiver_writer_seccomp.h.driver.md)**: The `archiver_writer_seccomp.h` file in the `firedancer` codebase is a generated header file that defines a seccomp filter policy for an archiver writer, specifying allowed and disallowed system calls based on the runtime architecture.
