# Purpose
This C header file, generated by a script named `generate_filters.py`, defines a seccomp (secure computing mode) filter policy for a specific application context, likely related to an archiver writer. The file is not intended to be edited manually, as indicated by the initial comment. It includes several Linux kernel headers necessary for defining seccomp filters, such as `linux/seccomp.h` and `linux/filter.h`, which are used to create a BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter) program. This program is designed to restrict the system calls that a process can make, enhancing security by allowing only specific, predefined system calls.

The file defines a function, [`populate_sock_filter_policy_archiver_writer`](#populate_sock_filter_policy_archiver_writer), which initializes a BPF filter array with specific rules. These rules check the architecture of the running process and allow only certain system calls, such as `write` and `fsync`, under specific conditions. The function uses macros and constants to define the behavior of the filter, such as `ARCH_NR` for architecture-specific checks and `SECCOMP_RET_KILL_PROCESS` to terminate the process if an unauthorized system call is attempted. This header file is part of a broader security mechanism, likely used in a larger application to ensure that only safe operations are performed, thereby reducing the risk of exploitation through system calls.

# Global Variables

---
### sock\_filter\_policy\_archiver\_writer\_instr\_cnt
- **Type**: `unsigned int`
- **Description**: The variable `sock_filter_policy_archiver_writer_instr_cnt` is a constant unsigned integer that holds the value 16. It represents the number of instructions in a socket filter policy used for seccomp (secure computing mode) filtering.
- **Use**: This variable is used to define the size of the `filter` array in the `populate_sock_filter_policy_archiver_writer` function, ensuring that the correct number of instructions are processed.


# Functions

---
### populate\_sock\_filter\_policy\_archiver\_writer<!-- {{#callable:populate_sock_filter_policy_archiver_writer}} -->
The function `populate_sock_filter_policy_archiver_writer` initializes a BPF filter array to enforce seccomp rules for syscall filtering based on architecture and specific file descriptors.
- **Inputs**:
    - `out_cnt`: The number of elements in the output filter array, which must be at least 16.
    - `out`: A pointer to an array of `sock_filter` structures where the filter rules will be copied.
    - `logfile_fd`: The file descriptor for the log file, used in syscall filtering.
    - `archive_fd`: The file descriptor for the archive file, used in syscall filtering.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if `out_cnt` is at least 16 using `FD_TEST` macro.
    - Define a `sock_filter` array with 16 elements to specify BPF instructions for syscall filtering.
    - Load the architecture from `seccomp_data` and compare it with `ARCH_NR`; if they don't match, jump to `RET_KILL_PROCESS`.
    - Load the syscall number and check if it matches `SYS_write` or `SYS_fsync`; if not, jump to `RET_KILL_PROCESS`.
    - For `SYS_write`, check if the first argument matches `2`, `archive_fd`, or `logfile_fd`; if none match, jump to `RET_KILL_PROCESS`.
    - For `SYS_fsync`, check if the first argument matches `logfile_fd`; if not, jump to `RET_KILL_PROCESS`.
    - Define `RET_KILL_PROCESS` to terminate the process if no conditions are met.
    - Define `RET_ALLOW` to allow the syscall if conditions are met.
    - Copy the filter array to the output using `fd_memcpy`.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it populates the `out` array with BPF filter rules.
