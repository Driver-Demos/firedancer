# Purpose
This C header file is a generated file that defines a seccomp (secure computing mode) filter policy for a specific application component, likely related to an "archiver feeder" based on its naming. The file is not intended to be edited manually, as indicated by the comment at the top. It includes several system and Linux-specific headers, such as `<linux/seccomp.h>` and `<linux/filter.h>`, which are necessary for defining and implementing seccomp filters. The primary functionality of this file is to set up a Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF) program that restricts the system calls available to a process, enhancing security by allowing only specific, predefined system calls.

The file defines a function, [`populate_sock_filter_policy_archiver_feeder`](#populate_sock_filter_policy_archiver_feeder), which initializes a BPF filter array with 14 instructions. These instructions enforce a policy that checks the architecture of the running process and allows only certain system calls, specifically `write` and `fsync`, under certain conditions. The filter uses conditional jumps to either allow the system call or terminate the process if the call is not permitted. This seccomp filter is architecture-specific, with support for i386, x86_64, and aarch64 architectures, and it uses macros to define the appropriate architecture number. The file is part of a broader security mechanism, likely used in a larger application to ensure that only safe and necessary system calls are executed, thereby reducing the risk of exploitation.

# Global Variables

---
### sock\_filter\_policy\_archiver\_feeder\_instr\_cnt
- **Type**: `unsigned int`
- **Description**: The `sock_filter_policy_archiver_feeder_instr_cnt` is a static constant unsigned integer that represents the number of instructions in a socket filter policy for the archiver feeder. It is set to 14, indicating that the filter policy consists of 14 instructions.
- **Use**: This variable is used to ensure that the output count (`out_cnt`) in the `populate_sock_filter_policy_archiver_feeder` function is sufficient to hold all 14 instructions of the filter policy.


# Functions

---
### populate\_sock\_filter\_policy\_archiver\_feeder<!-- {{#callable:populate_sock_filter_policy_archiver_feeder}} -->
The function `populate_sock_filter_policy_archiver_feeder` initializes a seccomp filter to restrict system calls based on architecture and specific syscall numbers, copying the filter to the provided output buffer.
- **Inputs**:
    - `out_cnt`: The number of elements in the output buffer, which must be at least 14.
    - `out`: A pointer to a buffer of `struct sock_filter` where the filter will be copied.
    - `logfile_fd`: The file descriptor to be checked against syscall arguments for write and fsync operations.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if `out_cnt` is at least 14 using `FD_TEST` macro.
    - Define a `struct sock_filter` array `filter` with 14 elements to specify the seccomp filter rules.
    - Load the architecture from `seccomp_data` and compare it with `ARCH_NR`; if not equal, jump to `RET_KILL_PROCESS`.
    - Load the syscall number and check if it is `SYS_write` or `SYS_fsync`; if not, jump to `RET_KILL_PROCESS`.
    - For `SYS_write`, check if the first argument is 2 or `logfile_fd`; if not, jump to `RET_KILL_PROCESS`.
    - For `SYS_fsync`, check if the first argument is `logfile_fd`; if not, jump to `RET_KILL_PROCESS`.
    - If none of the conditions are met, the process is killed (`RET_KILL_PROCESS`).
    - If conditions are met, allow the syscall (`RET_ALLOW`).
    - Copy the `filter` array to the `out` buffer using `fd_memcpy`.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it populates the `out` buffer with the seccomp filter rules.
