# Purpose
This C header file is a generated file that defines a seccomp (secure computing mode) filter policy for a specific application context, likely related to an archiving or playback functionality. The file is not intended to be edited manually, as indicated by the comment at the top, and is generated by a script named `generate_filters.py`. The primary purpose of this file is to set up a seccomp filter using the Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF) syntax to restrict the system calls that a process can make, enhancing security by limiting the process's capabilities to only those necessary for its operation.

The file includes several Linux headers related to auditing, capabilities, filtering, and seccomp, which are essential for defining and applying the seccomp filter. It defines a function, [`populate_sock_filter_policy_archiver_playback`](#populate_sock_filter_policy_archiver_playback), which initializes a BPF filter array with specific rules. These rules allow or deny system calls based on the architecture and specific syscall numbers, such as `SYS_write`, `SYS_read`, and `SYS_fsync`. The filter checks the architecture to ensure compatibility and then evaluates syscall numbers and arguments to determine whether to allow or kill the process. This file is part of a broader security mechanism, likely used in a larger application to ensure that only safe and necessary operations are performed, reducing the risk of exploitation through unauthorized system calls.

# Global Variables

---
### sock\_filter\_policy\_archiver\_playback\_instr\_cnt
- **Type**: `unsigned int`
- **Description**: The variable `sock_filter_policy_archiver_playback_instr_cnt` is a static constant of type `unsigned int` with a value of 17. It represents the number of instructions in a socket filter policy used for archiver playback in a seccomp filter.
- **Use**: This variable is used to ensure that the output count (`out_cnt`) in the `populate_sock_filter_policy_archiver_playback` function is sufficient to hold the 17 instructions of the seccomp filter.


# Functions

---
### populate\_sock\_filter\_policy\_archiver\_playback<!-- {{#callable:populate_sock_filter_policy_archiver_playback}} -->
The function `populate_sock_filter_policy_archiver_playback` initializes a seccomp BPF filter to enforce syscall restrictions based on architecture and specific file descriptors for logging and archiving.
- **Inputs**:
    - `out_cnt`: The number of elements in the output filter array, expected to be at least 17.
    - `out`: A pointer to an array of `struct sock_filter` where the filter instructions will be copied.
    - `logfile_fd`: The file descriptor for the log file, used to allow specific syscalls.
    - `archive_fd`: The file descriptor for the archive file, used to allow specific syscalls.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if `out_cnt` is at least 17, ensuring the output array can hold the filter instructions.
    - Initialize a `struct sock_filter` array with 17 BPF instructions to enforce syscall restrictions.
    - The first instruction checks if the architecture matches the expected architecture (`ARCH_NR`); if not, it jumps to kill the process.
    - Load the syscall number and check if it matches `SYS_write`, `SYS_read`, or `SYS_fsync`, jumping to respective checks if matched.
    - For `SYS_write`, check if the syscall argument 0 matches `2` or `logfile_fd`, allowing the syscall if matched, otherwise jumping to kill the process.
    - For `SYS_read`, check if the syscall argument 0 matches `archive_fd`, allowing the syscall if matched, otherwise jumping to kill the process.
    - For `SYS_fsync`, check if the syscall argument 0 matches `logfile_fd`, allowing the syscall if matched, otherwise jumping to kill the process.
    - If none of the conditions are met, the process is killed by default.
    - Copy the initialized filter array to the output array using `fd_memcpy`.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value but populates the `out` array with seccomp BPF filter instructions.
