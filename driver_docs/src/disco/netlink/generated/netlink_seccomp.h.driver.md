# Purpose
This C header file, `netlink_seccomp.h`, is a generated file that defines a seccomp (secure computing mode) filter policy for a program. The primary purpose of this file is to provide a predefined set of rules that restrict the system calls a process can make, enhancing security by limiting the attack surface. The file includes several Linux kernel headers related to auditing, capabilities, filtering, and seccomp, indicating its reliance on Linux-specific features for process control and security. The file is not intended to be edited manually, as it is automatically generated by a script named `generate_filters.py`.

The core functionality of this file is encapsulated in the [`populate_sock_filter_policy_netlink`](#populate_sock_filter_policy_netlink) function, which initializes a `sock_filter` array with 46 instructions. These instructions form a Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF) program that enforces the seccomp policy. The policy checks the architecture of the process and allows or denies specific system calls based on predefined conditions. For example, it allows system calls like `write`, `fsync`, `sendto`, and `recvfrom` under certain conditions, while any other system calls result in the process being killed. This file is part of a broader security framework, likely used in applications that require strict control over the system calls they can execute, such as network services or sandboxed environments.

# Global Variables

---
### sock\_filter\_policy\_netlink\_instr\_cnt
- **Type**: `unsigned int`
- **Description**: The variable `sock_filter_policy_netlink_instr_cnt` is a constant unsigned integer that holds the value 46. It represents the number of instructions in a socket filter policy for netlink communication.
- **Use**: This variable is used to ensure that the output buffer in the `populate_sock_filter_policy_netlink` function has enough space to hold all 46 instructions of the filter policy.


# Functions

---
### populate\_sock\_filter\_policy\_netlink<!-- {{#callable:populate_sock_filter_policy_netlink}} -->
The function `populate_sock_filter_policy_netlink` initializes a seccomp BPF filter to enforce a security policy on network-related system calls.
- **Inputs**:
    - `out_cnt`: The number of elements in the output filter array, which must be at least 46.
    - `out`: A pointer to an array of `struct sock_filter` where the filter instructions will be copied.
    - `logfile_fd`: A file descriptor for the log file, used in syscall checks.
    - `nl_mon_fd`: A file descriptor for netlink monitoring, used in syscall checks.
    - `nl_req_fd`: A file descriptor for netlink requests, used in syscall checks.
    - `arp_probe_fd`: A file descriptor for ARP probing, used in syscall checks.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if `out_cnt` is at least 46, otherwise the function will not proceed.
    - Define a static array `filter` of 46 `struct sock_filter` elements to hold the BPF instructions.
    - Load the architecture from `seccomp_data` and compare it with the expected architecture; if they don't match, jump to `RET_KILL_PROCESS`.
    - Load the syscall number and check if it matches `SYS_write`, `SYS_fsync`, `SYS_sendto`, or `SYS_recvfrom`; if none match, jump to `RET_KILL_PROCESS`.
    - For `SYS_write`, check if the first argument is 2 or matches `logfile_fd`; if not, jump to `RET_KILL_PROCESS`.
    - For `SYS_fsync`, check if the first argument matches `logfile_fd`; if not, jump to `RET_KILL_PROCESS`.
    - For `SYS_sendto`, check if the first argument matches `nl_req_fd` and subsequent arguments are zero; if not, check if it matches `arp_probe_fd` and subsequent arguments are zero, otherwise jump to `RET_KILL_PROCESS`.
    - For `SYS_recvfrom`, check if the first argument matches `nl_mon_fd` or `nl_req_fd` and subsequent arguments are zero; if not, jump to `RET_KILL_PROCESS`.
    - Copy the `filter` array to the `out` array using `fd_memcpy`.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it populates the `out` array with the BPF filter instructions.
