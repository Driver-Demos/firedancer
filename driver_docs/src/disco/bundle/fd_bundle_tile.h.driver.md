# Purpose
This code is a C header file that defines the interface for a "bundle client tile" within a larger software system, likely related to network communication. It specifies the use of HTTP/2 over TLS connections, utilizing TCP sockets and OpenSSL for secure communication, and integrates with Firedancer's libraries for HTTP/2 and gRPC logic. The header file includes a reference to another header, `fd_topo.h`, and declares a structure `fd_bundle_tile` and a typedef `fd_bundle_tile_t` for it, along with an external declaration of `fd_tile_bundle`, which is presumably a function or variable related to the tile's operation. The file is designed for environments where busy polling is acceptable, indicating a focus on performance over power efficiency.

### fd\_bundle\_tile\_t
- **Type**: `typedef struct fd_bundle_tile fd_bundle_tile_t;`
- **Description**: The `fd_bundle_tile_t` is a typedef for a forward-declared structure `fd_bundle_tile`, which is part of a system that requires HTTP/2 over TLS connections, utilizing TCP sockets and OpenSSL for secure communication. It is associated with Firedancer's HTTP/2 and gRPC logic, and is designed for environments where busy polling is acceptable, as it does not include power-saving features. The actual structure definition is not provided in the given code, indicating that it is likely defined elsewhere in the codebase.
