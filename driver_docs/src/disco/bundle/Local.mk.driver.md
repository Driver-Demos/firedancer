# Purpose
The provided content is a Makefile script used in a software build system to manage the compilation and testing of various components within a project. It uses conditional directives such as `ifdef` to check for specific build configurations or features, like `FD_HAS_INT128` and `FD_HAS_HOSTED`, which determine whether certain headers and object files should be included in the build process. The script employs macros like `add-hdrs` and `add-objs` to add header files and object files to the build, respectively, and `make-unit-test` and `run-unit-test` to define and execute unit tests for different modules, ensuring that the components such as `fd_bundle_crank` and `fd_bundle_client` are correctly compiled and tested under the specified conditions. This approach allows for a flexible and modular build process, adapting to different environments and feature sets.
