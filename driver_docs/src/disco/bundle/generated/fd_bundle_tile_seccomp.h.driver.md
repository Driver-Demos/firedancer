# Purpose
This C header file, `fd_bundle_tile_seccomp.h`, is a generated file that defines a seccomp (secure computing mode) filter policy using the Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF) syntax. The primary purpose of this file is to provide a predefined set of rules that restrict the system calls a process can make, enhancing security by limiting the attack surface. The file includes various Linux headers necessary for defining seccomp filters and uses conditional compilation to ensure compatibility with different architectures, such as i386, x86_64, and aarch64. The seccomp filter is implemented as a static function, [`populate_sock_filter_policy_fd_bundle_tile`](#populate_sock_filter_policy_fd_bundle_tile), which populates an array of `sock_filter` structures with 91 instructions. These instructions define which system calls are allowed or denied based on specific conditions, such as syscall numbers and arguments.

The filter policy is designed to allow or deny system calls based on their syscall numbers and arguments, with specific checks for common network and file operations like `read`, `write`, `recvmsg`, `sendmsg`, and `socket`. The policy uses a combination of direct allowances and conditional checks to determine whether a syscall should be permitted or result in the termination of the process (`RET_KILL_PROCESS`). This approach provides a fine-grained control mechanism over the execution environment of a process, making it suitable for applications that require strict security measures. The file is intended to be included in other C source files where this seccomp policy needs to be applied, and it does not define any public APIs or external interfaces beyond the static function for populating the filter.

# Global Variables

---
### sock\_filter\_policy\_fd\_bundle\_tile\_instr\_cnt
- **Type**: `unsigned int`
- **Description**: The variable `sock_filter_policy_fd_bundle_tile_instr_cnt` is a static constant of type `unsigned int` with a value of 91. It represents the number of instructions in a socket filter policy used for seccomp (secure computing mode) filtering.
- **Use**: This variable is used to ensure that the output buffer for the socket filter policy has enough space to accommodate all 91 instructions.


# Functions

---
### populate\_sock\_filter\_policy\_fd\_bundle\_tile<!-- {{#callable:populate_sock_filter_policy_fd_bundle_tile}} -->
The function `populate_sock_filter_policy_fd_bundle_tile` initializes a seccomp filter with specific rules for system call handling and copies it to the provided output buffer.
- **Inputs**:
    - `out_cnt`: The number of elements in the output buffer, which must be at least 91.
    - `out`: A pointer to an array of `struct sock_filter` where the filter rules will be copied.
    - `logfile_fd`: A file descriptor for a log file, used in specific filter rules.
    - `keylog_fd`: A file descriptor for a keylog, used in specific filter rules.
    - `etc_hosts_fd`: A file descriptor for the /etc/hosts file, used in specific filter rules.
    - `etc_resolv_conf`: A file descriptor for the /etc/resolv.conf file, used in specific filter rules.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if `out_cnt` is at least 91, ensuring the output buffer is large enough.
    - Define a `struct sock_filter` array with 91 elements, each representing a BPF instruction for seccomp filtering.
    - The filter begins by checking if the architecture of the script matches the runtime architecture, jumping to a kill process instruction if not.
    - Load the syscall number and compare it against a list of allowed syscalls, jumping to specific labels or allowing the syscall based on conditions.
    - For certain syscalls like `recvmsg`, `writev`, `sendmsg`, `sendto`, `fsync`, `socket`, `shutdown`, `fcntl`, `bind`, `setsockopt`, and `lseek`, additional checks on syscall arguments are performed to determine if they should be allowed or if the process should be killed.
    - If none of the syscalls match, the process is killed by default.
    - Copy the defined filter array into the output buffer using `fd_memcpy`.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it populates the provided `out` buffer with the seccomp filter rules.
