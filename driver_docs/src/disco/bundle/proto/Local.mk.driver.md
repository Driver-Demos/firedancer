# Purpose
The file content is a Makefile snippet that uses a macro to add object files to a build target. It calls the `add-objs` function to include the object files `auth.pb`, `block_engine.pb`, `bundle.pb`, `packet.pb`, `shared.pb`, and `timestamp.pb` into the `fd_disco` target, facilitating the build process in a software project.
