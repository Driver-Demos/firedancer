# Purpose
This file defines a Protocol Buffers schema using version 3 syntax. It specifies a package named "shared" and includes definitions for three messages: `Header`, which contains a timestamp field; `Heartbeat`, which includes a count field; and `Socket`, which comprises an IP address and a port number. The file also imports "timestamp.proto" to utilize Google's `Timestamp` type.
