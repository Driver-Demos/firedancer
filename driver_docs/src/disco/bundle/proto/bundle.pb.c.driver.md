# Purpose
This code is an automatically generated C header file for use with the nanopb library, which is a small code-size Protocol Buffers implementation in C. The file includes the header "bundle.pb.h" and contains preprocessor directives to ensure compatibility with a specific version of the nanopb generator, indicated by the `PB_PROTO_HEADER_VERSION` check. The `PB_BIND` macros are used to bind Protocol Buffer message types, `bundle_Bundle` and `bundle_BundleUuid`, to their respective C structures, facilitating serialization and deserialization operations. This file is part of a larger system that uses Protocol Buffers for data interchange, ensuring that the generated code is synchronized with the Protocol Buffers definitions.
