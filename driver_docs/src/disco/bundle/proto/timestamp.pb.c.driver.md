# Purpose
This code is a C header file that contains automatically generated constant definitions for use with the nanopb library, specifically for handling Protocol Buffers (protobuf) messages. It includes a check to ensure compatibility with the nanopb version used to generate the file, requiring regeneration if the version does not match. The `PB_BIND` macro is used to bind the `google_protobuf_Timestamp` message type, facilitating its serialization and deserialization. This file is part of a system that uses Protocol Buffers for efficient data interchange, particularly for timestamp data.
