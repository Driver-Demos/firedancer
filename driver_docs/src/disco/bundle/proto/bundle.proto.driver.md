# Purpose
This code is a Protocol Buffers (protobuf) definition file, which is used to define the structure of data for serialization and deserialization across different systems. It provides a narrow functionality focused on defining data structures, specifically for a "Bundle" and a "BundleUuid" message. The file imports two other protobuf files, "packet.proto" and "shared.proto," indicating that it relies on definitions from these files, such as the "Header" from "shared.proto" and "Packet" from "packet.proto." The "Bundle" message includes a header and a list of packets, while the "BundleUuid" message associates a bundle with a unique identifier. This file is intended to be used as part of a larger system where these data structures are serialized for communication between services or components.
# Imports and Dependencies

- `shared.proto`


# Data Structures

---
### Bundle
- **Type**: `message`
- **Members**:
    - `header`: A shared.Header object that contains metadata for the bundle.
    - `packets`: A repeated field of packet.Packet objects representing the collection of packets in the bundle.
- **Description**: The `Bundle` message is a protocol buffer message that encapsulates a collection of packets along with a header. It is designed to group multiple `packet.Packet` objects, which are defined in an imported `packet.proto` file, under a single `shared.Header`, which is defined in an imported `shared.proto` file. This structure is useful for transmitting or processing multiple packets as a single unit, with the header providing necessary metadata for the entire bundle.


---
### BundleUuid
- **Type**: `message`
- **Members**:
    - `bundle`: A field of type `bundle.Bundle` that represents a collection of packets with a shared header.
    - `uuid`: A field of type `bytes` that stores a universally unique identifier for the bundle.
- **Description**: The `BundleUuid` message is a data structure that encapsulates a `Bundle` and associates it with a unique identifier. The `bundle` field contains a `Bundle` object, which includes a header and a list of packets, while the `uuid` field provides a unique identifier in the form of a byte array. This structure is useful for uniquely identifying and managing collections of packets within a system.
