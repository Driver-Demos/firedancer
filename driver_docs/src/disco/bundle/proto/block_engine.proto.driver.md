# Purpose
This code is a Protocol Buffers (proto) file, which defines the structure of messages and services for a block engine system, specifically for communication between validators and block engines. It provides a narrow functionality focused on defining the data exchange format and RPC (Remote Procedure Call) services for subscribing to packet and bundle streams, as well as retrieving block builder fee information. The file imports other proto files, indicating dependencies on shared message structures defined elsewhere, and it defines several message types and a service named `BlockEngineValidator`. This service allows validators to subscribe to streams of packets and bundles and to query fee information, facilitating efficient and structured communication in a blockchain or distributed ledger context.
