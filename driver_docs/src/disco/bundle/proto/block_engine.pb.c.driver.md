# Purpose
This C source code file is an automatically generated set of constant definitions for use with the nanopb library, specifically version 0.4.9.1. It includes bindings for several protocol buffer message types related to a "block engine," such as `SubscribePacketsRequest`, `SubscribePacketsResponse`, `SubscribeBundlesRequest`, `SubscribeBundlesResponse`, `BlockBuilderFeeInfoRequest`, and `BlockBuilderFeeInfoResponse`. The file ensures compatibility with a specific version of the nanopb protocol header, indicated by a preprocessor directive that triggers an error if the version does not match. The `PB_BIND` macro is used to associate each protocol buffer message type with its corresponding C structure, facilitating serialization and deserialization operations.
