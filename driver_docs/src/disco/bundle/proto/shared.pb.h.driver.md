# Purpose
This C header file, `shared_pb.h`, is an automatically generated file by the nanopb library, specifically version 0.4.9.1. It defines data structures and associated metadata for Protocol Buffers (protobuf) messages, which are used for serializing structured data. The file provides a narrow functionality focused on defining and managing protobuf message structures, specifically `shared_Header`, `shared_Heartbeat`, and `shared_Socket`. These structures are designed to be used in applications that require efficient data serialization and deserialization, such as network communication or data storage systems. The file includes necessary initializers, field tags, and encoding specifications for these message structures, ensuring they can be correctly serialized and deserialized using nanopb.

The header file is intended to be included in other C source files that need to work with these specific protobuf messages. It defines public APIs for initializing and handling these messages, making it a crucial component for any application that relies on these data structures. The file also includes compatibility definitions for older versions of nanopb, ensuring that existing codebases can transition smoothly to newer versions. The inclusion of `extern "C"` blocks indicates that the file is compatible with C++ compilers, allowing for interoperability in mixed-language projects. Overall, this file serves as a bridge between the application logic and the nanopb library, facilitating the use of protobufs in C applications.

# Data Structures

---
### shared\_Header
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `has_ts`: A boolean indicating whether the timestamp field is present.
    - `ts`: A google_protobuf_Timestamp structure representing a timestamp.
- **Description**: The `shared_Header` structure is a part of a protocol buffer message definition, used to encapsulate a timestamp. It contains a boolean field `has_ts` to indicate the presence of a timestamp, and a `ts` field which is a `google_protobuf_Timestamp` structure. This structure is typically used in communication protocols to include optional timestamp information in messages.


---
### shared\_Heartbeat
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `count`: A 64-bit unsigned integer representing the heartbeat count.
- **Description**: The `shared_Heartbeat` structure is a simple data structure that contains a single member, `count`, which is a 64-bit unsigned integer. This structure is likely used to represent a heartbeat signal or counter in a system, where the `count` field keeps track of the number of heartbeats or events that have occurred. It is part of a larger set of structures used in a protocol buffer context, as indicated by its inclusion in a nanopb-generated header file.


---
### shared\_Socket
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `ip`: A string representing the IP address of the socket.
    - `port`: An integer representing the port number of the socket.
- **Description**: The `shared_Socket` structure is designed to encapsulate the network address information for a socket, consisting of an IP address and a port number. The IP address is stored as a byte array of fixed size, while the port is a 64-bit integer, allowing for a wide range of port numbers. This structure is part of a larger system generated by nanopb, a protocol buffer implementation, and is used for network communication purposes.
