# Purpose
This C source code file is an automatically generated configuration file for the nanopb library, specifically version 0.4.9.1. It includes the header file "shared.pb.h" and contains preprocessor directives to ensure compatibility with the correct version of the nanopb protocol buffer header. The file uses the `PB_BIND` macro to bind protocol buffer message types (`shared_Header`, `shared_Heartbeat`, and `shared_Socket`) to their respective C structures, facilitating serialization and deserialization of these messages. This file is part of a system that uses protocol buffers for efficient data interchange, and it ensures that the generated code is synchronized with the protocol definitions.
