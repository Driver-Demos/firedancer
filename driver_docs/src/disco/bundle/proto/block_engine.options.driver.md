# Purpose
The file content specifies a configuration constraint for the `pubkey` attribute within the `BlockBuilderFeeInfoResponse` class of the `block_engine` module. It enforces a maximum length of 44 characters for the `pubkey` field, ensuring that any public key associated with this response does not exceed the defined character limit.
