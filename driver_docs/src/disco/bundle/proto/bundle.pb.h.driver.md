# Purpose
This file is a C header file generated by the nanopb library, specifically version 0.4.9.1, which is used for encoding and decoding Protocol Buffers (protobufs) in C. It defines data structures and associated metadata for two protobuf messages: `bundle_Bundle` and `bundle_BundleUuid`. These structures include fields for a header, packets, and a UUID, with initialization macros provided for default and zeroed states. The file also includes field tags and encoding specifications necessary for manual encoding/decoding processes, ensuring compatibility with nanopb's encoding mechanisms. Additionally, it contains conditional compilation directives to ensure compatibility with the correct version of the nanopb generator, and it provides backward compatibility with older nanopb versions.

# Data Structures

---
### bundle\_Bundle
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `has_header`: A boolean indicating if the header is present.
    - `header`: A shared_Header structure representing the header of the bundle.
    - `packets`: A pb_callback_t type used for handling repeated packet messages.
- **Description**: The `bundle_Bundle` structure is a part of a nanopb-generated protocol buffer implementation, designed to encapsulate a collection of packets with an optional header. It includes a boolean `has_header` to indicate the presence of a header, a `shared_Header` structure to store the header information if present, and a `pb_callback_t` for managing a list of packet messages, allowing for efficient handling of potentially large or variable-sized data sets.

### bundle\_BundleUuid
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `has_bundle`: A boolean indicating if the 'bundle' field is present.
    - `bundle`: An instance of 'bundle_Bundle' representing a collection of data packets.
    - `uuid`: A 128-byte array serving as a unique identifier for the bundle.
- **Description**: The 'bundle_BundleUuid' structure is designed to encapsulate a bundle of data packets along with a unique identifier. It includes a boolean flag 'has_bundle' to indicate the presence of the 'bundle' field, which itself is a complex structure containing a header and a callback for packets. The 'uuid' field is a fixed-size byte array used to uniquely identify the bundle, ensuring that each instance of 'bundle_BundleUuid' can be distinctly recognized.
