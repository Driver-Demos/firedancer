# Purpose
This code is an automatically generated C source file that defines constant bindings for Protocol Buffers (protobuf) messages using the nanopb library, specifically version 0.4.9.1. It includes the header file "packet.pb.h" and checks for compatibility with the expected protobuf header version, ensuring that the file is regenerated if the version does not match. The `PB_BIND` macro is used to bind C structures to their corresponding protobuf message definitions, such as `packet_PacketBatch`, `packet_Packet`, `packet_Meta`, and `packet_PacketFlags`, with some bindings using an automatic field count and others specifying a field count of 2. This file is part of a system that serializes and deserializes data structures for communication or storage, leveraging nanopb's lightweight protobuf implementation for embedded systems.
