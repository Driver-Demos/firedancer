# Purpose
This C header file, `auth.pb.h`, is an automatically generated file using the nanopb library, which is a small code-size Protocol Buffers implementation in C. The file defines data structures and constants for handling authentication-related messages in a protocol buffer format. It includes definitions for several message types, such as `auth_GenerateAuthChallengeRequest`, `auth_GenerateAuthChallengeResponse`, `auth_GenerateAuthTokensRequest`, `auth_GenerateAuthTokensResponse`, `auth_RefreshAccessTokenRequest`, and `auth_RefreshAccessTokenResponse`. These structures are used to facilitate the generation and management of authentication tokens, including challenges and responses, as well as access and refresh tokens. The file also defines an enumeration, `auth_Role`, which specifies different roles such as RELAYER, SEARCHER, VALIDATOR, and SHREDSTREAM_SUBSCRIBER, indicating the roles for which tokens can be generated.

The header file is intended to be included in other C source files that require these protocol buffer definitions for authentication purposes. It provides a narrow functionality focused on authentication token management, with specific structures and fields for encoding and decoding messages related to authentication processes. The file includes initializer macros for the defined structures, ensuring that they can be easily instantiated with default or zero values. Additionally, it specifies field tags and encoding specifications for manual encoding and decoding, which are essential for the nanopb library's operation. The file also includes compatibility definitions for older versions of nanopb, ensuring that it can be used with legacy code. Overall, this header file serves as a crucial component in a system that requires secure and efficient handling of authentication tokens using protocol buffers.

# Data Structures

---
### auth\_Role
- **Type**: `enum`
- **Members**:
    - `auth_Role_RELAYER`: Represents a role with the value 0, typically used for relaying operations.
    - `auth_Role_SEARCHER`: Represents a role with the value 1, typically used for searching operations.
    - `auth_Role_VALIDATOR`: Represents a role with the value 2, typically used for validation operations.
    - `auth_Role_SHREDSTREAM_SUBSCRIBER`: Represents a role with the value 3, typically used for subscribing to shred streams.
- **Description**: The `auth_Role` is an enumeration that defines a set of roles within an authentication system, each associated with a specific integer value. These roles include RELAYER, SEARCHER, VALIDATOR, and SHREDSTREAM_SUBSCRIBER, which are used to categorize different types of operations or permissions within the system. This enum is likely used to specify the role a client is attempting to generate tokens for, as seen in the context of the `auth_GenerateAuthChallengeRequest` structure.


---
### auth\_GenerateAuthChallengeRequest
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `role`: Specifies the role for which the client is attempting to generate tokens.
    - `pubkey`: Holds the client's 32-byte public key.
- **Description**: The `auth_GenerateAuthChallengeRequest` structure is used to encapsulate the necessary information for generating an authentication challenge. It includes the role that the client is attempting to authenticate for, represented by the `auth_Role` enum, and the client's public key, which is a 32-byte array. This structure is part of a larger authentication protocol, likely used in a system where different roles require different authentication tokens.


---
### auth\_GenerateAuthChallengeResponse
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `challenge`: A byte array representing the authentication challenge string.
- **Description**: The `auth_GenerateAuthChallengeResponse` structure is used to encapsulate the response for an authentication challenge request. It contains a single member, `challenge`, which is a byte array that holds the challenge string. This structure is part of a larger authentication protocol, where the challenge is used to verify the identity of a client attempting to authenticate.


---
### auth\_GenerateAuthTokensRequest
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `challenge`: The pre-signed challenge represented as a byte array.
    - `client_pubkey`: The 32-byte public key corresponding to the signing keypair.
    - `signed_challenge`: The 64-byte signature of the challenge signed by the client's private key.
- **Description**: The `auth_GenerateAuthTokensRequest` structure is used to encapsulate the necessary data for generating authentication tokens. It includes a pre-signed challenge, the client's public key, and a signed challenge. The signed challenge is a signature created by the client's private key, which must correspond to the public key provided. This structure is part of an authentication process where the client proves possession of the private key by signing a challenge token.


---
### auth\_Token
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `value`: A string representing the token value.
    - `has_expires_at_utc`: A boolean indicating if the expiration time is set.
    - `expires_at_utc`: A timestamp indicating when the token will expire.
- **Description**: The `auth_Token` structure is used to represent an authentication token, including its value and expiration details. It contains a token value as a string, a boolean flag to indicate if the expiration time is set, and a timestamp for the expiration time. This structure is essential for managing authentication tokens, ensuring they are valid and have a defined lifespan.


---
### auth\_GenerateAuthTokensResponse
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `has_access_token`: Indicates if the access token is present.
    - `access_token`: Holds the access token which grants access to resources.
    - `has_refresh_token`: Indicates if the refresh token is present.
    - `refresh_token`: Holds the refresh token used to obtain a new access token.
- **Description**: The `auth_GenerateAuthTokensResponse` structure is used to encapsulate the response from an authentication token generation process. It contains two main tokens: an `access_token` which provides access to resources, and a `refresh_token` which is used to refresh the `access_token` when it expires. The presence of these tokens is indicated by the `has_access_token` and `has_refresh_token` boolean fields, respectively. This structure is crucial for managing authentication sessions, allowing clients to maintain access without re-authenticating frequently.


---
### auth\_RefreshAccessTokenRequest
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `refresh_token`: A non-expired refresh token obtained from the GenerateAuthTokens method, represented as a string.
- **Description**: The `auth_RefreshAccessTokenRequest` structure is used to request a new access token by providing a valid, non-expired refresh token. This structure contains a single member, `refresh_token`, which is a string that holds the refresh token obtained from a previous authentication process. The refresh token is essential for obtaining a new access token without requiring the user to re-authenticate.


---
### auth\_RefreshAccessTokenResponse
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `has_access_token`: Indicates whether the access_token is present.
    - `access_token`: Holds the fresh access token of type auth_Token.
- **Description**: The `auth_RefreshAccessTokenResponse` structure is used to encapsulate the response received when a refresh token is used to obtain a new access token. It contains a boolean flag `has_access_token` to indicate the presence of a new access token, and an `access_token` field of type `auth_Token` which holds the actual token data. This structure is part of an authentication system that manages token-based access control.
