# Purpose
This C source code file is an automatically generated set of constant definitions for use with the nanopb library, which is a small code-size Protocol Buffers implementation in C. The file is specifically tailored to handle protocol buffer messages related to authentication processes, as indicated by the inclusion of various `auth_*` structures. These structures include requests and responses for generating authentication challenges and tokens, as well as refreshing access tokens. The file is not intended to be executed directly but rather to be included in other C programs that require these protocol buffer definitions for handling authentication-related data.

The code uses the `PB_BIND` macro to bind C structures to their corresponding protocol buffer message types, facilitating serialization and deserialization of these messages. Each `PB_BIND` invocation associates a C structure with a protocol buffer message, specifying the message type and its encoding options. The file includes a version check to ensure compatibility with the nanopb generator version, which is crucial for maintaining consistency and preventing runtime errors due to version mismatches. This file serves as a crucial component in a larger system that relies on protocol buffers for communication, particularly in scenarios involving authentication workflows.
