# Purpose
The provided content is a Makefile, which is used to automate the build process for generating C source and header files from Protocol Buffer (.proto) definitions using the Nanopb generator. The `NANOPB_GEN` variable specifies the script `nanopb_generator.py` as the tool for this task. The `PROTOS` variable lists the base names of the .proto files that need to be processed. The `generate` target, marked as `.PHONY` to indicate it is not a file, uses these base names to create corresponding `.pb.h` and `.pb.c` files by invoking the Nanopb generator with specific options. Additionally, a `sed` command is used to modify the generated header files to include a custom header path. The `clean` target, also marked as `.PHONY`, is responsible for removing the generated files, ensuring a clean state for subsequent builds.
