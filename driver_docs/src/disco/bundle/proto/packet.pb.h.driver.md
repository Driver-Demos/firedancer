# Purpose
This C header file, generated by the nanopb library, defines data structures and associated metadata for handling packets in a protocol buffer format. The file is intended to be included in other C source files to facilitate the serialization and deserialization of packet data using the nanopb library, which is a small code-size Protocol Buffers implementation in C. The file includes definitions for several key structures: `packet_PacketBatch`, `packet_PacketFlags`, `packet_Meta`, and `packet_Packet`. These structures encapsulate various attributes of network packets, such as data payload, metadata like size and address, and flags indicating packet status or origin.

The header file also provides initializer macros for these structures, ensuring they can be easily instantiated with default or zero values. Additionally, it defines field tags and encoding specifications necessary for nanopb's encoding and decoding processes. The file includes compatibility definitions for older versions of nanopb, ensuring that it can be used with legacy code. This header is a crucial component for applications that require efficient and compact serialization of packet data, particularly in environments where resources are constrained, such as embedded systems.

# Data Structures

---
### packet\_PacketBatch
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `packets`: A callback field for handling repeated packet messages.
- **Description**: The `packet_PacketBatch` structure is designed to manage a batch of packet messages using a callback mechanism. It contains a single member, `packets`, which is a callback type (`pb_callback_t`) that facilitates the handling of repeated packet messages, allowing for dynamic processing of packet data within the batch. This structure is part of a larger system for managing network packets, likely in a protocol buffer context, as indicated by its use of nanopb, a small code-size Protocol Buffers implementation in C.


---
### packet\_PacketFlags
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `discard`: Indicates whether the packet should be discarded.
    - `forwarded`: Indicates whether the packet has been forwarded.
    - `repair`: Indicates whether the packet is marked for repair.
    - `simple_vote_tx`: Indicates whether the packet is a simple vote transaction.
    - `tracer_packet`: Indicates whether the packet is a tracer packet.
    - `from_staked_node`: Indicates whether the packet originated from a staked node.
- **Description**: The `packet_PacketFlags` structure is a collection of boolean flags used to describe various states or attributes of a network packet. Each flag represents a specific condition or characteristic, such as whether the packet should be discarded, has been forwarded, requires repair, is a simple vote transaction, is a tracer packet, or originated from a staked node. This structure is likely used in network communication protocols to manage and process packets based on their attributes.


---
### packet\_Meta
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `size`: Represents the size of the packet in bytes.
    - `addr`: Stores the address as a string with a maximum length of 256 characters.
    - `port`: Holds the port number associated with the packet.
    - `has_flags`: Indicates whether the packet has associated flags.
    - `flags`: Contains the flags related to the packet, defined by the packet_PacketFlags structure.
    - `sender_stake`: Represents the stake of the sender in the network.
- **Description**: The `packet_Meta` structure is designed to encapsulate metadata information about a network packet. It includes fields for the packet's size, address, and port, as well as a boolean to indicate the presence of flags. The `flags` field is a nested structure that provides additional details about the packet's status and origin. Additionally, the `sender_stake` field is used to store the sender's stake, which may be relevant in network protocols that consider the sender's stake for processing or prioritization.


---
### packet\_Packet
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `data`: A byte array of size 2048 used to store packet data.
    - `has_meta`: A boolean indicating if metadata is present.
    - `meta`: A structure containing metadata about the packet, including size, address, port, flags, and sender stake.
- **Description**: The `packet_Packet` structure is designed to encapsulate a packet's data and its associated metadata. It includes a large byte array for the packet's data, a boolean flag to indicate the presence of metadata, and a `packet_Meta` structure that holds detailed metadata information such as the packet's size, address, port, flags, and sender stake. This structure is part of a larger system generated by nanopb, a protocol buffer implementation, and is used for efficient serialization and deserialization of packet data.
