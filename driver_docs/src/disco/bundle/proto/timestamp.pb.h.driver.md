# Purpose
This file is a C header file automatically generated by the nanopb library, specifically version 0.4.9.1, for handling Protocol Buffers (protobuf) messages. It defines the structure and associated metadata for a `google_protobuf_Timestamp` message, which includes two fields: `seconds` (an `int64_t`) and `nanos` (an `int32_t`). The file includes macros for initializing the structure with default or zero values, field tags for manual encoding/decoding, and specifications for encoding the fields using nanopb. It also ensures compatibility with older versions of nanopb and provides a maximum encoded size for the message. The header is wrapped in an include guard to prevent multiple inclusions and supports C++ linkage.

### google\_protobuf\_Timestamp
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `seconds`: Represents the number of seconds since the Unix epoch.
    - `nanos`: Represents the fractional seconds component, in nanoseconds, of the timestamp.
- **Description**: The `google_protobuf_Timestamp` structure is used to represent a point in time as a combination of seconds and nanoseconds since the Unix epoch. It is part of the Protocol Buffers (protobuf) library, which is a language-neutral, platform-neutral extensible mechanism for serializing structured data. This structure is typically used in applications that require precise time representation and manipulation, such as logging, event tracking, or time-stamping data.
