# Purpose
This C header file is an automatically generated component of a larger system that utilizes the nanopb library, a small code-size Protocol Buffers implementation in C. The file defines several data structures and associated metadata for handling protocol buffer messages related to a "block engine" system. Specifically, it includes definitions for request and response messages for subscribing to packets and bundles, as well as for retrieving block builder fee information. These structures are used to serialize and deserialize data in a format that can be easily transmitted over a network or stored, adhering to the Protocol Buffers specification.

The file includes several key components: type definitions for the message structures, initializer macros for setting default values, and field encoding specifications that guide the nanopb library in encoding and decoding these messages. It also includes conditional compilation checks to ensure compatibility with the correct version of the nanopb generator. The header file is intended to be included in other C source files, providing a public API for interacting with the block engine's protocol buffer messages. This file is part of a broader system that likely involves network communication or data processing tasks where efficient serialization is crucial.

# Data Structures

---
### block\_engine\_SubscribePacketsRequest
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `dummy_field`: A placeholder character field, likely used for alignment or future expansion.
- **Description**: The `block_engine_SubscribePacketsRequest` is a simple data structure defined as a C struct with a single member, `dummy_field`, which is a character type. This struct appears to be a placeholder or a minimal representation for a request to subscribe to packets in a block engine context, possibly intended for future expansion or to maintain a consistent API structure.


---
### block\_engine\_SubscribePacketsResponse
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `has_header`: A boolean indicating if the 'header' field is present.
    - `header`: A 'shared_Header' structure representing the header information.
    - `has_batch`: A boolean indicating if the 'batch' field is present.
    - `batch`: A 'packet_PacketBatch' structure representing a batch of packets.
- **Description**: The 'block_engine_SubscribePacketsResponse' structure is used to encapsulate the response for a packet subscription request in a block engine system. It contains optional fields for a header and a batch of packets, each accompanied by a boolean flag indicating their presence. This structure is part of a protocol buffer definition, likely used for communication between components in a distributed system.


---
### block\_engine\_SubscribeBundlesRequest
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `dummy_field`: A placeholder character field, likely used for alignment or future expansion.
- **Description**: The `block_engine_SubscribeBundlesRequest` is a simple data structure defined as a C struct with a single member, `dummy_field`, which is a character type. This struct appears to be a placeholder or a minimal representation for a request to subscribe to bundles, possibly intended for future expansion or to maintain a consistent API structure. Its current implementation does not hold any meaningful data or functionality.


---
### block\_engine\_SubscribeBundlesResponse
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `bundles`: A callback field for handling repeated message data related to bundles.
- **Description**: The `block_engine_SubscribeBundlesResponse` structure is part of a protocol buffer implementation using nanopb, designed to handle responses for bundle subscription requests. It contains a single member, `bundles`, which is a callback type field used to manage repeated message data, specifically for handling multiple bundle UUIDs. This structure is likely used in scenarios where a client subscribes to receive updates or notifications about bundles, and the response needs to efficiently handle potentially large sets of bundle data.


---
### block\_engine\_BlockBuilderFeeInfoRequest
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `dummy_field`: A placeholder character field, likely used for alignment or future expansion.
- **Description**: The `block_engine_BlockBuilderFeeInfoRequest` is a simple data structure defined as a struct with a single character field named `dummy_field`. This field serves as a placeholder, potentially for alignment purposes or to allow for future expansion of the struct without breaking binary compatibility. The struct is part of a larger set of message definitions generated by the nanopb library, which is used for encoding and decoding Protocol Buffers in C.


---
### block\_engine\_BlockBuilderFeeInfoResponse
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `pubkey`: A character array of size 45 that stores the public key.
    - `commission`: A 64-bit unsigned integer representing the commission percentage (0-100).
- **Description**: The `block_engine_BlockBuilderFeeInfoResponse` structure is used to encapsulate information about a block builder's fee, specifically including the public key of the block builder and the commission rate they charge. This structure is part of a larger protocol buffer system, likely used in a blockchain or distributed ledger context, where it is important to track and manage fees associated with block building activities.
