# Purpose
This C source code file is a collection of preprocessor directives using `#define` to establish constants related to a "keyguard tile," which appears to be a component of a larger system. The file defines several constants, including sizes and offsets for different "crank" bundles, as well as byte sequences for various operations like initialization and change events. The absence of an include guard is intentional, as the file solely contains `#define` statements, which are used to minimize the attack surface of the keyguard tile by limiting the scope to necessary constants. This approach suggests a focus on security and efficiency within the system's design.
