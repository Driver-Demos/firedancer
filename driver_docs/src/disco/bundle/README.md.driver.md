# Purpose
The provided content is a documentation file outlining the features and development status of two versions of a software component referred to as the "bundle tile." The document serves as a checklist comparing the features of the existing "Bundle tile 1.0" with the planned features for "Bundle tile 2.0." It lists the capabilities supported by the older version, such as packet and bundle delivery, gRPC connections, and basic metrics, while also highlighting features that were not implemented, like seccomp sandboxing and connection time out. For the new version, it specifies the intended enhancements, including various performance metrics and SSL key logging, indicating these are yet to be developed. Additionally, there is a section for features that are still under consideration, such as power-saving mechanisms.
