# Purpose
This Python script is a narrowly focused utility designed to process and transform data from an XML file named 'metrics.xml'. It imports specific functions and classes from other modules, indicating that it is part of a larger codebase. The script's main function reads and parses the XML file to extract metrics, applies a layout operation on the parsed data, and then generates code and documentation based on these metrics using the `write_codegen` and `write_docs` functions. The script is intended to be executed as a standalone program, as indicated by the `if __name__ == '__main__':` block, which ensures that the `main()` function is called when the script is run directly.

# Functions

---
### main<!-- {{#callable:firedancer/src/disco/metrics/gen_metrics.main}} -->
The `main` function orchestrates the reading, parsing, and processing of metrics from an XML file, and then generates code and documentation based on these metrics.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - Read the contents of 'metrics.xml' file into a string.
    - Parse the string content to create a 'metrics' object using 'parse_metrics'.
    - Call the 'layout' method on the 'metrics' object to prepare it for further processing.
    - Pass the 'metrics' object to 'write_codegen' to generate code based on the metrics.
    - Pass the 'metrics' object to 'write_docs' to generate documentation based on the metrics.
- **Output**: The function does not return any value; it performs file reading, parsing, and calls other functions to generate code and documentation as side effects.
