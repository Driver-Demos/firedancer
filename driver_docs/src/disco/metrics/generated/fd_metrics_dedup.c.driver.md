# Purpose
This C source code file is an auto-generated configuration file that defines a collection of metrics for a deduplication process. It includes a header file, `fd_metrics_dedup.h`, which likely contains necessary declarations and definitions for handling these metrics. The file defines an array, `FD_METRICS_DEDUP`, of type `fd_metrics_meta_t`, which is initialized with specific metrics using the `DECLARE_METRIC` macro. Each metric is associated with a descriptive name and a type, `COUNTER`, indicating that these metrics are intended to count occurrences of specific events, such as transaction bundle peer failures, deduplication failures, and gossiped votes received. The comment at the top of the file indicates that it is generated by a script (`gen_metrics.py`) and should not be manually edited, suggesting that it is part of a larger automated system for tracking and managing deduplication metrics.

### FD\_METRICS\_DEDUP
- **Type**: `const fd_metrics_meta_t[]`
- **Description**: FD_METRICS_DEDUP is a constant array of type fd_metrics_meta_t, which is used to store metadata for various deduplication metrics. Each element in the array is initialized using the DECLARE_METRIC macro, which likely sets up a metric with a specific name and type, in this case, COUNTER. The array is sized by the FD_METRICS_DEDUP_TOTAL constant, indicating the total number of metrics it can hold.
- **Use**: This variable is used to define and store metadata for deduplication-related metrics, which can be used for monitoring and analysis purposes.
