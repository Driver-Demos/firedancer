# Purpose
This C header file is a generated configuration file that defines a set of metrics related to delays in a Proof of History (PoH) system, likely used in a blockchain or distributed ledger context. The file includes definitions for histograms that measure various delay intervals, such as the delay between becoming a leader in a slot and receiving the bank or the first microblock, as well as the delay in completing a slot and initializing a bundle. Each metric is characterized by an offset, name, type, description, conversion factor, and minimum and maximum values, which are used to configure and interpret the histogram data. The file also declares an external array of metadata, `FD_METRICS_POH`, which presumably holds the details of these metrics for use in other parts of the system. The inclusion of base and enum headers suggests that this file is part of a larger metrics framework.
# Imports and Dependencies

- `../fd_metrics_base.h`
- `fd_metrics_enums.h`


# Global Variables

### FD\_METRICS\_POH
- **Type**: `fd_metrics_meta_t array`
- **Description**: `FD_METRICS_POH` is a global constant array of type `fd_metrics_meta_t` with a size defined by `FD_METRICS_POH_TOTAL`, which is 4. This array is used to store metadata for various metrics related to Proof of History (PoH) delays, such as leader delay, microblock delay, slot completion delay, and bundle initialization delay.
- **Use**: This variable is used to hold metadata for different PoH delay metrics, facilitating the tracking and analysis of these delays in the system.
