# Purpose
This C header file is auto-generated, as indicated by the comment at the top, and is not intended for manual editing. It defines constants and metadata related to a specific metric, "store_transactions_inserted," which is likely used for performance monitoring or logging within a larger system. The file includes references to other header files, suggesting it is part of a broader metrics framework. The constants defined here specify the offset, name, type, description, and conversion method for the metric, which is a counter type, indicating it tracks the number of transactions inserted while a system component was a leader. Additionally, it declares an external array, `FD_METRICS_STORE`, which is presumably used to store or access metric metadata, with its size defined by `FD_METRICS_STORE_TOTAL`.

### FD\_METRICS\_STORE
- **Type**: `fd_metrics_meta_t array`
- **Description**: `FD_METRICS_STORE` is a global constant array of type `fd_metrics_meta_t` with a size defined by `FD_METRICS_STORE_TOTAL`. It is used to store metadata for metrics, specifically for tracking metrics related to transactions inserted while being a leader in the shreds.
- **Use**: This variable is used to hold metadata for metrics, allowing the system to track and manage metrics efficiently.
