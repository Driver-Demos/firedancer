# Purpose
This C source code file is a generated file that defines a comprehensive set of metrics related to QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections) protocol operations. The file is not intended to be manually edited, as indicated by the comment at the top, and is likely part of a larger system that monitors and analyzes network performance or application behavior using the QUIC protocol. The file includes an array of `fd_metrics_meta_t` structures, each initialized with various metrics that track different aspects of QUIC operations, such as transaction overrun, packet reception and transmission, connection states, handshake events, and frame processing outcomes.

The metrics are categorized into counters, gauges, and histograms, providing both quantitative and qualitative insights into the QUIC protocol's performance. The use of macros like `DECLARE_METRIC`, `DECLARE_METRIC_ENUM`, and `DECLARE_METRIC_HISTOGRAM_SECONDS` suggests a structured approach to defining these metrics, likely facilitating easy integration with a monitoring framework. The file serves as a crucial component for performance monitoring, enabling developers and system administrators to track and analyze the behavior of QUIC connections, identify potential issues, and optimize network performance. The metrics cover a wide range of events and states, making this file a key part of a broader telemetry or analytics system.

### FD\_METRICS\_QUIC
- **Type**: `const fd_metrics_meta_t[]`
- **Description**: `FD_METRICS_QUIC` is a global constant array of type `fd_metrics_meta_t` that holds various metrics related to QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections) protocol operations. Each element in the array represents a specific metric, such as transaction counts, connection states, packet statistics, and error occurrences, which are categorized as counters, gauges, or histograms. The metrics are used to monitor and analyze the performance and reliability of QUIC connections.
- **Use**: This variable is used to store and provide access to a comprehensive set of metrics for monitoring QUIC protocol activities.
