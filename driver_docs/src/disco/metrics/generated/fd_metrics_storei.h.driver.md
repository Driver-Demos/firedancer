# Purpose
This C header file is auto-generated by a script named `gen_metrics.py` and is not intended for manual editing. It defines a set of constants and an external array related to metrics, specifically focusing on gauge metrics for turbine slots. The file includes two gauge metrics: `storei_first_turbine_slot` and `storei_current_turbine_slot`, each with associated offset, name, type, description, and conversion type. These metrics are likely used for monitoring or logging purposes within a larger system, as indicated by the inclusion of base and enum headers (`fd_metrics_base.h` and `fd_metrics_enums.h`). The file also declares an external array `FD_METRICS_STOREI`, which holds metadata for these metrics, suggesting its role in a broader metrics collection or analysis framework.
# Imports and Dependencies

### FD\_METRICS\_STOREI
- **Type**: `array of `fd_metrics_meta_t``
- **Description**: `FD_METRICS_STOREI` is a global constant array of `fd_metrics_meta_t` structures, with a size defined by `FD_METRICS_STOREI_TOTAL`, which is 2. This array is used to store metadata for metrics related to turbine slots, specifically the first and current turbine slots.
- **Use**: This variable is used to hold metadata for metrics, facilitating the tracking and management of turbine slot metrics.
