# Purpose
This C source file is a generated code file that defines a comprehensive set of metrics related to a gossip protocol, likely used in a distributed system or network. The file includes an array of `fd_metrics_meta_t` structures, each representing a specific metric. These metrics are categorized into various types such as gauges and counters, and they cover a wide range of activities and states within the gossip protocol. The metrics include information about message types, peer interactions, and error conditions, providing detailed insights into the operation and performance of the gossip protocol.

The file is not intended to be manually edited, as indicated by the comment at the top, and is likely generated by a script (`gen_metrics.py`). This suggests that the metrics are part of a larger system where automated tools are used to ensure consistency and accuracy in metric definitions. The file is designed to be included in other parts of the system, as indicated by the inclusion of the header file `fd_metrics_gossip.h`. The metrics defined here serve as a public API for monitoring and analyzing the behavior of the gossip protocol, allowing developers and system administrators to track performance, diagnose issues, and optimize the network's operation.
# Imports and Dependencies

- `fd_metrics_gossip.h`


# Global Variables

### FD\_METRICS\_GOSSIP
- **Type**: `const fd_metrics_meta_t[]`
- **Description**: `FD_METRICS_GOSSIP` is a global constant array of type `fd_metrics_meta_t` that holds metadata for various gossip-related metrics. Each element in the array is defined using macros like `DECLARE_METRIC` and `DECLARE_METRIC_ENUM`, which specify the metric's name, type (e.g., GAUGE or COUNTER), and additional parameters such as categories or reasons. This array is used to track and categorize different metrics related to gossip protocol operations, such as message types, peer interactions, and error conditions.
- **Use**: This variable is used to define and store metadata for a comprehensive set of metrics related to the gossip protocol, facilitating monitoring and analysis of gossip activities.
