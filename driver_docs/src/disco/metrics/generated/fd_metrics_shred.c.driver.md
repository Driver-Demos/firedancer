# Purpose
This C source file is a generated code file, as indicated by the comment at the top, which states it is produced by a script named `gen_metrics.py`. The file is not intended for manual editing. It defines an array of `fd_metrics_meta_t` structures named `FD_METRICS_SHRED`, which is used to store metadata for various metrics related to a process referred to as "shredding." The metrics include counters and histograms for different events and states, such as the number of microblocks abandoned, invalid block IDs, and the duration of shredding operations. Additionally, it tracks the results of processing shreds, with possible outcomes like "BAD_SLOT," "PARSE_FAILED," "REJECTED," "IGNORED," "OKAY," and "COMPLETES."

The file is likely part of a larger system that monitors and records performance or operational metrics, possibly for debugging, performance analysis, or system health monitoring. The metrics are categorized using macros like `DECLARE_METRIC`, `DECLARE_METRIC_HISTOGRAM_NONE`, and `DECLARE_METRIC_ENUM`, which suggest a structured approach to defining and handling these metrics. The file does not define public APIs or external interfaces directly but rather provides a structured data set that can be used by other parts of the system to access and manipulate these metrics. The inclusion of a header file, `fd_metrics_shred.h`, suggests that this file is part of a modular system where the metrics are defined in a separate header for use across different components.

### FD\_METRICS\_SHRED
- **Type**: `const fd_metrics_meta_t[]`
- **Description**: FD_METRICS_SHRED is a global constant array of type fd_metrics_meta_t, which holds metadata for various metrics related to the shredding process. Each element in the array is initialized using macros that define different types of metrics, such as histograms, counters, and enumerations, capturing various aspects of the shredding process like duration, processing results, and failure counts. This array is used to track and report on the performance and outcomes of the shredding operations.
- **Use**: This variable is used to store and manage metadata for a set of predefined metrics related to the shredding process, facilitating performance monitoring and analysis.
