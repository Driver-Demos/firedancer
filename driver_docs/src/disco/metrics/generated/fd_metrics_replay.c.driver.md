# Purpose
This C header file is automatically generated by a script named `gen_metrics.py` and is not intended for manual editing. It includes the header `fd_metrics_replay.h` and defines a constant array `FD_METRICS_REPLAY` of type `fd_metrics_meta_t`. This array contains metric declarations using the `DECLARE_METRIC` macro, specifically for `REPLAY_SLOT` and `REPLAY_LAST_VOTED_SLOT`, both categorized as `GAUGE` metrics. The file is likely part of a larger system for tracking or monitoring replay metrics, where these metrics are used to measure or report specific aspects of the system's performance or state.
