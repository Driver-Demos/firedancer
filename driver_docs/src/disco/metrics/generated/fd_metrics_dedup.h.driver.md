# Purpose
This C header file is auto-generated by a script named `gen_metrics.py` and is not intended for manual editing. It defines a set of constants and metadata related to metrics counters used in a deduplication process, likely within a larger system that tracks transaction processing. Each metric is associated with a unique offset, a descriptive name, a type (indicating it is a counter), a description explaining its purpose, and a converter type, which in this case is set to none. The file also declares an external array `FD_METRICS_DEDUP` that presumably holds metadata for these metrics, indicating that this file is part of a larger framework for monitoring and analyzing transaction deduplication performance.

### FD\_METRICS\_DEDUP
- **Type**: `array of `fd_metrics_meta_t``
- **Description**: `FD_METRICS_DEDUP` is a global constant array of `fd_metrics_meta_t` structures, which holds metadata for deduplication-related metrics. The array is defined with a size of `FD_METRICS_DEDUP_TOTAL`, which is 3, indicating it contains three metric metadata entries.
- **Use**: This variable is used to store and provide access to metadata for deduplication metrics, such as transaction deduplication failures and gossiped votes received.
