# Purpose
This C source code file is an auto-generated configuration file that defines a collection of metrics for a system, likely related to network or data processing operations. It includes an array of `fd_metrics_meta_t` structures, each initialized with specific metrics using macros like `DECLARE_METRIC` and `DECLARE_METRIC_ENUM`. These metrics are categorized as either counters or gauges, indicating whether they are used to count occurrences of events (e.g., transactions, packets, errors) or to measure quantities at a point in time (e.g., heap size, connected status). The file is not meant to be manually edited, as it is generated by a script (`gen_metrics.py`), ensuring consistency and correctness in the metrics definitions.

### FD\_METRICS\_BUNDLE
- **Type**: `array of `fd_metrics_meta_t``
- **Description**: `FD_METRICS_BUNDLE` is a global constant array of type `fd_metrics_meta_t` that holds metadata for various metrics related to bundle operations. Each element in the array is initialized using macros like `DECLARE_METRIC` and `DECLARE_METRIC_ENUM`, which define different types of metrics such as counters and gauges. The metrics include transaction and packet reception, error types, heap size, and connection status, among others.
- **Use**: This variable is used to store and manage metadata for different metrics in the system, facilitating monitoring and analysis of bundle operations.
