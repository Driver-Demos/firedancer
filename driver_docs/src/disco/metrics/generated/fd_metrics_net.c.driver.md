# Purpose
This C source code file is an auto-generated configuration file that defines a collection of network-related metrics using a predefined structure `fd_metrics_meta_t`. The file includes a header, `fd_metrics_net.h`, and initializes an array `FD_METRICS_NET` with various metrics, each declared using the `DECLARE_METRIC` macro. These metrics are categorized as either `COUNTER` or `GAUGE`, indicating whether they represent cumulative counts or instantaneous values, respectively. The metrics cover a range of network activities, such as packet reception and transmission counts, byte totals, and various failure and idle/busy states, which are likely used for monitoring and performance analysis of network operations. The file is not intended to be manually edited, as it is generated by a script named `gen_metrics.py`.

### FD\_METRICS\_NET
- **Type**: `const fd_metrics_meta_t[]`
- **Description**: `FD_METRICS_NET` is a global constant array of type `fd_metrics_meta_t` that holds network-related metrics. Each element in the array is initialized using the `DECLARE_METRIC` macro, which specifies the metric name and its type, either `COUNTER` or `GAUGE`. This array is used to track various network statistics such as packet counts, byte totals, and error counts.
- **Use**: This variable is used to store and provide access to a collection of network metrics for monitoring and analysis purposes.
