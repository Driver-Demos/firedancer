# Purpose
This C header file is auto-generated by a script named `gen_metrics.py` and is not intended for manual editing. It defines a series of constants related to transaction verification metrics, specifically counters for different types of transaction failures during the verification process. Each metric is associated with an offset, a name, a type, a description, and a converter type, which are used to track and describe various failure scenarios such as peer failure, parse failure, deduplication failure, and verification failure. The file also declares an external array `FD_METRICS_VERIFY` that presumably holds metadata for these metrics, with a total of four defined metrics. This setup is likely part of a larger system for monitoring and analyzing transaction processing performance.

### FD\_METRICS\_VERIFY
- **Type**: `fd_metrics_meta_t array`
- **Description**: `FD_METRICS_VERIFY` is a global constant array of type `fd_metrics_meta_t` with a size defined by `FD_METRICS_VERIFY_TOTAL`, which is 4. This array is used to store metadata for various verification metrics, such as transaction bundle peer failure, parse failure, deduplication failure, and verification failure.
- **Use**: This variable is used to hold metadata for different verification metrics, facilitating the tracking and analysis of transaction verification failures.
