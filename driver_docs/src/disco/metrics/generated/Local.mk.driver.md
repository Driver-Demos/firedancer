# Purpose
The provided code is a snippet from a Makefile, which is used to automate the build process in software development. It utilizes the `call` function to dynamically add header files (`*.h`) and object files derived from C source files (`*.c`) located in the directory specified by `MKPATH`. The object files are associated with the target `fd_disco`.
