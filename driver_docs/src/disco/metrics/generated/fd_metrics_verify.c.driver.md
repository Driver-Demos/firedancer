# Purpose
This C source code file is an auto-generated configuration file that defines a collection of metrics for a verification process. It includes a header file, `fd_metrics_verify.h`, which likely contains necessary declarations and definitions related to the metrics. The file defines an array, `FD_METRICS_VERIFY`, of type `fd_metrics_meta_t`, which is initialized with several metrics using the `DECLARE_METRIC` macro. Each metric is associated with a specific verification failure type, such as transaction bundle peer failure or transaction parse failure, and is categorized as a `COUNTER`, indicating that these metrics are likely used to count occurrences of specific verification failures. The file is not intended to be manually edited, as it is generated by a script named `gen_metrics.py`.

### FD\_METRICS\_VERIFY
- **Type**: `const fd_metrics_meta_t[]`
- **Description**: FD_METRICS_VERIFY is a constant array of type fd_metrics_meta_t, which is used to store metadata for various verification metrics. Each element in the array is initialized using the DECLARE_METRIC macro, which likely sets up a metric with a specific name and type, such as COUNTER. The array size is determined by the FD_METRICS_VERIFY_TOTAL constant.
- **Use**: This variable is used to define and initialize a set of metrics related to transaction verification processes.
