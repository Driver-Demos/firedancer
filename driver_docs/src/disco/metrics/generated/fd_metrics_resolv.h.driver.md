# Purpose
This C header file is automatically generated by a script named `gen_metrics.py` and is not intended for manual editing. It defines a series of constants and macros related to metrics counters, which are used to track various transaction-related events in a system. Each metric is associated with a unique offset, name, type, description, and conversion type, providing a structured way to monitor specific occurrences such as transactions dropped due to unavailable banks, operations on transaction stashes, and address lookup table resolutions. The file includes references to other header files, `fd_metrics_base.h` and `fd_metrics_enums.h`, suggesting that it relies on predefined types and enumerations for its functionality. Additionally, it declares an external array `FD_METRICS_RESOLV` that presumably holds metadata for these metrics, facilitating their integration into a larger metrics collection or monitoring framework.

### FD\_METRICS\_RESOLV
- **Type**: `fd_metrics_meta_t array`
- **Description**: `FD_METRICS_RESOLV` is a global constant array of type `fd_metrics_meta_t` with a size defined by `FD_METRICS_RESOLV_TOTAL`, which is 13. This array is used to store metadata for various resolution-related metrics, such as transaction drops due to unavailable banks, operations on transaction stashes, and address lookup table resolutions.
- **Use**: This variable is used to hold metadata for different resolution metrics, facilitating the tracking and analysis of various transaction resolution events.
