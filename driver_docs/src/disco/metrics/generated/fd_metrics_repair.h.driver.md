# Purpose
This C header file is a generated configuration file that defines a series of metrics counters related to packet handling in a network repair context. It includes definitions for various packet types and their associated metadata, such as offsets, names, types, descriptions, and conversion methods. The file is structured to facilitate tracking and categorizing different packet events, such as received client and server packets, corrupt packets, and sent packet types. Each metric is defined with a unique offset and descriptive name, which aids in monitoring network performance and diagnosing issues related to packet transmission and reception. The file is not intended for manual editing, as it is automatically generated by a script (`gen_metrics.py`), ensuring consistency and accuracy in the metrics definitions.

### FD\_METRICS\_REPAIR
- **Type**: `fd_metrics_meta_t array`
- **Description**: `FD_METRICS_REPAIR` is a global constant array of type `fd_metrics_meta_t` with a size defined by `FD_METRICS_REPAIR_TOTAL`, which is 15. This array is used to store metadata for various repair-related metrics, such as the number of client and server packets received, corrupt packets, and packet types.
- **Use**: This variable is used to hold metadata for repair metrics, facilitating the tracking and analysis of network repair operations.
