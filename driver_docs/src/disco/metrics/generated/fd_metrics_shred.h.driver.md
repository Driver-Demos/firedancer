# Purpose
This C source file is a generated code file that defines a set of metrics related to a system that processes data in a "shred" format, likely within a distributed or networked environment. The file includes definitions for various metrics, such as histograms and counters, which are used to monitor and analyze the performance and behavior of the system. Each metric is defined with specific attributes, including an offset, name, type, description, and conversion type, which are used to track different aspects of the shredding process, such as the number of contact infos in a cluster, the number of microblocks abandoned, and the duration of processing shreds.

The file is structured to provide a comprehensive set of metrics that can be used for performance monitoring and debugging. It includes both histogram and counter types, indicating that it tracks both frequency distributions and cumulative counts of events. The metrics cover a range of activities, from the processing of microblocks and shreds to the handling of FEC (Forward Error Correction) sets. The file is intended to be included in a larger codebase, as indicated by the inclusion of other header files and the declaration of an external array of metric metadata. This setup suggests that the file is part of a broader system for monitoring and managing the shredding process, providing detailed insights into the system's operation and potential areas for optimization.
# Imports and Dependencies

- `../fd_metrics_base.h`
- `fd_metrics_enums.h`


# Global Variables

### FD\_METRICS\_SHRED
- **Type**: `array of `fd_metrics_meta_t``
- **Description**: `FD_METRICS_SHRED` is a global constant array of `fd_metrics_meta_t` structures, which holds metadata for various metrics related to the shredding process in a system. Each element in the array represents a specific metric, such as counters and histograms, detailing aspects like the number of microblocks abandoned, invalid block IDs, and the duration of shredding operations.
- **Use**: This variable is used to store and provide access to metadata for different shredding-related metrics, facilitating monitoring and analysis of the shredding process.
