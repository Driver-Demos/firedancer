# Purpose
This C source code file is an auto-generated configuration file that defines a collection of metrics related to a "repair" process, likely in a network or communication system. The file includes an array of `fd_metrics_meta_t` structures, each initialized with specific metrics using macros like `DECLARE_METRIC` and `DECLARE_METRIC_ENUM`. These metrics are categorized as counters and are used to track various events, such as received and sent packets, packet types, and error conditions like corrupted messages or invalid signatures. The file is not meant to be manually edited, as indicated by the comment at the top, and is likely part of a larger system that uses these metrics for monitoring or debugging purposes.

### FD\_METRICS\_REPAIR
- **Type**: `const fd_metrics_meta_t[]`
- **Description**: `FD_METRICS_REPAIR` is a global constant array of type `fd_metrics_meta_t` that holds various metrics related to repair operations. Each element in the array represents a specific metric, such as the number of client packets received, server packets received, corrupted packets, and different types of packets sent and received. The array is initialized with a series of macro calls that define these metrics as counters or enumerations.
- **Use**: This variable is used to store and manage metrics for monitoring and analyzing repair operations in the system.
