# Purpose
This C source file is a generated code file that defines a comprehensive set of metrics for monitoring and analyzing the performance of a transaction scheduling and processing system, likely within a blockchain or distributed ledger context. The file includes a series of macros that define various metrics, such as histograms, counters, and gauges, each associated with specific aspects of transaction handling, such as scheduling, insertion, and completion of microblocks, as well as transaction counts and durations. These metrics are crucial for understanding the efficiency and effectiveness of the transaction processing pipeline, providing insights into transaction throughput, latency, and resource utilization.

The file is structured to provide a detailed and organized collection of metrics, each with a unique identifier, name, type, description, and conversion factor. The metrics cover a wide range of activities, including transaction insertion, scheduling, and completion, as well as resource usage like compute units and transaction pool sizes. This file is intended to be included in a larger codebase, as indicated by the inclusion of header files such as `fd_metrics_base.h` and `fd_metrics_enums.h`. The metrics defined here are likely used by other components of the system to log and report performance data, enabling developers and operators to monitor system health and optimize performance. The presence of an external declaration for `FD_METRICS_PACK` suggests that these metrics are part of a public API or interface used by other parts of the system to access and utilize the defined metrics.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `../fd_metrics_base.h`
- `fd_metrics_enums.h`


# Global Variables

### FD\_METRICS\_PACK
- **Type**: `array of `fd_metrics_meta_t``
- **Description**: `FD_METRICS_PACK` is a global constant array of `fd_metrics_meta_t` structures, which holds metadata for various metrics related to transaction processing and microblock scheduling in a system. The array is defined with a size of `FD_METRICS_PACK_TOTAL`, which is 70, indicating it contains 70 different metric metadata entries.
- **Use**: This variable is used to store and provide access to metadata for different metrics, facilitating the monitoring and analysis of transaction processing performance.
