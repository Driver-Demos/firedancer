# Purpose
This C header file is automatically generated by a script named `gen_metrics.py` and is not intended for manual editing. It defines a series of constants and macros related to network socket metrics, specifically focusing on system call counts and data transmission statistics. The file includes definitions for various metrics such as the number of `sendmmsg` and `recvmmsg` system calls, packets received and sent, packets that failed to send, and total bytes transmitted and received. Each metric is associated with an offset, a name, a type, a description, and a conversion type, which are likely used for tracking and reporting purposes in a larger system. The file also declares an external array `FD_METRICS_SOCK` that presumably holds metadata for these metrics, facilitating their integration into a broader metrics collection framework.

### FD\_METRICS\_SOCK
- **Type**: `fd_metrics_meta_t array`
- **Description**: `FD_METRICS_SOCK` is a global constant array of type `fd_metrics_meta_t` with a size defined by `FD_METRICS_SOCK_TOTAL`. This array is used to store metadata for various socket-related metrics, such as the number of packets sent or received, and the total bytes transmitted or received.
- **Use**: This variable is used to hold metadata for socket metrics, facilitating the tracking and analysis of socket operations.
