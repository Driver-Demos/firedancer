# Purpose
This C header file is auto-generated by a script named `gen_metrics.py` and is not intended for manual editing. It defines a series of constants related to metrics counters, which are used to track various events in a system, such as transactions sent to a leader and instances where leader information is not found or is non-routable. Each metric is associated with an offset, a name, a type, a description, and a converter type, which are likely used for logging or monitoring purposes. The file includes references to other header files, `fd_metrics_base.h` and `fd_metrics_enums.h`, suggesting it is part of a larger metrics framework. Additionally, it declares an external array `FD_METRICS_SEND` that presumably holds metadata for these metrics, indicating its role in facilitating structured access to these metrics within the application.

### FD\_METRICS\_SEND
- **Type**: `fd_metrics_meta_t array`
- **Description**: `FD_METRICS_SEND` is a global constant array of type `fd_metrics_meta_t` with a size defined by `FD_METRICS_SEND_TOTAL`. It is used to store metadata for various metrics related to sending transactions and leader interactions, such as counts of transactions sent to a leader and instances where leader information is not found or nonroutable.
- **Use**: This variable is used to hold metadata for different send-related metrics, facilitating the tracking and analysis of transaction sending operations.
