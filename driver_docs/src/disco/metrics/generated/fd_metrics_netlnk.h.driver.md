# Purpose
This C header file is auto-generated by a script named `gen_metrics.py` and is not intended for manual editing. It defines a series of constants and macros related to network link metrics, specifically for tracking various network events and states using counters and gauges. The file includes definitions for metrics such as the number of netlink drop events, full link and route table syncs, live updates processed, and network interface and route counts. Each metric is associated with an offset, name, type, description, and a converter type, which is set to none in this case. Additionally, the file declares an external array `FD_METRICS_NETLNK` that presumably holds metadata for these metrics, facilitating their use in monitoring and diagnostics within a larger system.

### FD\_METRICS\_NETLNK
- **Type**: `fd_metrics_meta_t array`
- **Description**: `FD_METRICS_NETLNK` is a global constant array of type `fd_metrics_meta_t` that holds metadata for various network link metrics. It is defined with a size of `FD_METRICS_NETLNK_TOTAL`, which is 13, indicating it contains 13 different metric entries. Each entry in the array corresponds to a specific network link metric, such as drop events, full syncs, updates, interface counts, and neighbor probe statistics.
- **Use**: This variable is used to store and provide access to metadata for network link metrics, facilitating the monitoring and analysis of network performance.
