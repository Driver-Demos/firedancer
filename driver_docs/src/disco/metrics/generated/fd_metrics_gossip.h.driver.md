# Purpose
This C source file is a generated code file that defines a comprehensive set of metrics related to a gossip protocol, likely used in a distributed system for monitoring and diagnostics. The file includes a series of preprocessor macros that define various metrics, such as gauges and counters, which are used to track different aspects of the gossip protocol's operation. These metrics include timestamps, message counts, error counts, and other operational statistics. Each metric is associated with a name, type, description, and an offset, which suggests that these metrics are stored in a structured format, possibly in an array or a similar data structure.

The file is not intended to be edited manually, as indicated by the comment at the top, and it relies on external header files (`fd_metrics_base.h` and `fd_metrics_enums.h`) for additional definitions and enumerations. The metrics cover a wide range of functionalities, including message sending and receiving, error handling, and peer management, providing a detailed view of the gossip protocol's performance and behavior. This file is likely part of a larger system where these metrics are collected and analyzed to ensure the reliability and efficiency of the gossip protocol. The presence of an external array `FD_METRICS_GOSSIP` suggests that these metrics are intended to be accessed programmatically, possibly for integration with monitoring tools or dashboards.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `../fd_metrics_base.h`
- `fd_metrics_enums.h`


# Global Variables

### FD\_METRICS\_GOSSIP
- **Type**: `fd_metrics_meta_t[]`
- **Description**: `FD_METRICS_GOSSIP` is a global constant array of `fd_metrics_meta_t` structures, which holds metadata for various gossip-related metrics. The array is indexed by predefined offsets and contains information such as metric names, types, descriptions, and conversion methods. This array is used to track and manage metrics related to gossip protocol operations, such as message counts, errors, and peer interactions.
- **Use**: This variable is used to store and provide access to metadata for gossip metrics, facilitating the monitoring and analysis of gossip protocol performance and behavior.
