# Purpose
This C header file is automatically generated by a script named `gen_metrics.py` and is not intended for manual editing. It defines a set of constants and an external array related to metrics, specifically focusing on replay slots in a system. The file includes two header files, `fd_metrics_base.h` and `fd_metrics_enums.h`, which likely provide foundational types and enumerations for metrics handling. The constants defined in this file specify offsets, names, types, descriptions, and converters for two gauge metrics: `replay_slot` and `replay_last_voted_slot`. These metrics are likely used to track and report specific performance or state information within a larger application, with the `FD_METRICS_REPLAY` array serving as a collection of metadata for these metrics.

### FD\_METRICS\_REPLAY
- **Type**: `fd_metrics_meta_t array`
- **Description**: `FD_METRICS_REPLAY` is a global constant array of type `fd_metrics_meta_t` with a size defined by `FD_METRICS_REPLAY_TOTAL`, which is 2. This array is used to store metadata for replay metrics, specifically for 'replay_slot' and 'replay_last_voted_slot', each associated with a gauge type metric.
- **Use**: This variable is used to hold metadata for replay-related metrics, facilitating the tracking and management of these metrics in the system.
