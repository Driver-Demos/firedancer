# Purpose
This C source code file is a generated file that defines a series of metrics counters related to banking transactions. The file is not intended to be manually edited, as indicated by the comment at the top. It includes definitions for various transaction-related metrics, such as failures in transaction sanitization, execution, and precompile verification, as well as metrics for slot acquisition and transaction results. Each metric is defined with a unique offset, name, type, description, and converter type, which are used to track and categorize different outcomes and states of banking transactions within a system.

The file serves as a part of a larger metrics collection framework, likely used for monitoring and analyzing the performance and reliability of banking transactions in a software system. It includes a comprehensive set of counters that cover a wide range of transaction states, from successful executions to various failure modes. The metrics are defined using macros, which provide a structured and consistent way to manage these counters. The file also declares an external array, `FD_METRICS_BANK`, which presumably holds metadata for these metrics, facilitating their use in other parts of the system. This file is likely included in a larger application to provide detailed insights into transaction processing, aiding in debugging, performance tuning, and ensuring system reliability.

### FD\_METRICS\_BANK
- **Type**: `fd_metrics_meta_t array`
- **Description**: `FD_METRICS_BANK` is a global constant array of type `fd_metrics_meta_t` with a size defined by `FD_METRICS_BANK_TOTAL`. This array is used to store metadata for various bank-related metrics, such as transaction failures, slot acquisitions, and transaction results.
- **Use**: This variable is used to hold metadata for different bank metrics, facilitating the tracking and analysis of various transaction and processing outcomes.
