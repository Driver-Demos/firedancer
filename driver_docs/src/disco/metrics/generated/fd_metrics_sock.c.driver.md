# Purpose
This C source code file is an auto-generated configuration file that defines an array of metrics related to socket operations, specifically for monitoring and tracking various socket system call activities and their outcomes. The file includes a header, "fd_metrics_sock.h," and declares a constant array `FD_METRICS_SOCK` of type `fd_metrics_meta_t`, which is presumably a structure or typedef defined elsewhere. Each entry in the array is initialized using macros like `DECLARE_METRIC_ENUM` and `DECLARE_METRIC`, which likely expand to define specific metrics such as counters for different socket errors and packet counts. The purpose of this file is to provide a structured way to collect and categorize metrics for socket operations, facilitating performance monitoring and error tracking in networked applications.

### FD\_METRICS\_SOCK
- **Type**: `const fd_metrics_meta_t[]`
- **Description**: FD_METRICS_SOCK is a global constant array of type fd_metrics_meta_t, which holds metadata for various socket-related metrics. Each element in the array is initialized using macros like DECLARE_METRIC_ENUM and DECLARE_METRIC, which define different types of socket system call metrics and their associated error states or counters. This array is used to track and categorize socket operations and their outcomes, such as send and receive system calls, packet counts, and byte totals.
- **Use**: This variable is used to store and organize metadata for monitoring and analyzing socket operations and their performance metrics.
