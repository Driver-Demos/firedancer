# Purpose
This C source code file is an auto-generated configuration file that defines a collection of metrics for a system, likely related to network or transaction resolution processes. It includes an array of `fd_metrics_meta_t` structures, each initialized with specific metrics using macros like `DECLARE_METRIC` and `DECLARE_METRIC_ENUM`. These metrics are categorized as counters and are used to track various events or states, such as transaction operations and lookup table resolutions, with specific outcomes like "SUCCESS" or "ACCOUNT_NOT_FOUND". The file is not meant to be manually edited, as indicated by the comment, and is likely part of a larger system for monitoring or logging performance and operational statistics.

### FD\_METRICS\_RESOLV
- **Type**: `const fd_metrics_meta_t[]`
- **Description**: `FD_METRICS_RESOLV` is a global constant array of type `fd_metrics_meta_t` that holds metric definitions related to resolution operations. Each element in the array is defined using macros like `DECLARE_METRIC` and `DECLARE_METRIC_ENUM`, which specify different types of resolution metrics and their associated counters. The array is indexed by `FD_METRICS_RESOLV_TOTAL`, which determines its size.
- **Use**: This variable is used to store and manage various resolution metrics, allowing the system to track and report on different resolution-related events and their outcomes.
