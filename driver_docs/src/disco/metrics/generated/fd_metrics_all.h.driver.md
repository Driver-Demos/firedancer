# Purpose
This C source file is a generated code file that defines a comprehensive set of metrics for monitoring and analyzing the performance and behavior of a system, likely related to network operations and data processing. The file includes a series of metric definitions, each characterized by a name, type, description, and conversion method. These metrics are organized into categories such as "LINK OUT," "LINK IN," and "TILE," indicating their relevance to different aspects of the system's operation. The metrics cover a wide range of performance indicators, including counts of events like context switches, data consumption, and overrun incidents, as well as gauges for monitoring statuses such as process and thread IDs, tile status, and backpressure conditions.

The file imports several other header files, suggesting that it is part of a larger system where these metrics are used to provide insights into various components, such as networking, socket operations, and data verification. The metrics are defined using macros, which facilitate easy updates and maintenance of the metric definitions. Additionally, the file declares external arrays and constants that likely serve as interfaces for other parts of the system to access and utilize these metrics. This structured approach to defining and organizing metrics indicates that the file is intended to be integrated into a broader monitoring framework, providing a standardized way to track and report on system performance and health.

# Global Variables

---
### FD\_METRICS\_ALL
- **Type**: `fd_metrics_meta_t[]`
- **Description**: `FD_METRICS_ALL` is a global constant array of `fd_metrics_meta_t` structures, which holds metadata for various metrics used throughout the system. The array is defined with a size of `FD_METRICS_ALL_TOTAL`, which is 16, indicating it contains 16 different metric metadata entries. This array is likely used to provide a centralized collection of metric definitions that can be accessed globally within the application.
- **Use**: This variable is used to store and provide access to metadata for all defined metrics in the system, facilitating metric tracking and management.


---
### FD\_METRICS\_ALL\_LINK\_IN
- **Type**: `const fd_metrics_meta_t[]`
- **Description**: `FD_METRICS_ALL_LINK_IN` is a global constant array of `fd_metrics_meta_t` structures, which holds metadata for various link input metrics. It is defined with a size of `FD_METRICS_ALL_LINK_IN_TOTAL`, which is 8, indicating it contains metadata for 8 different metrics related to link input operations.
- **Use**: This variable is used to store and provide access to metadata for link input metrics, facilitating the tracking and analysis of link input performance.


---
### FD\_METRICS\_ALL\_LINK\_OUT
- **Type**: `fd_metrics_meta_t[]`
- **Description**: `FD_METRICS_ALL_LINK_OUT` is an external constant array of `fd_metrics_meta_t` structures, which is used to store metadata for link-out metrics. The array is defined with a size of `FD_METRICS_ALL_LINK_OUT_TOTAL`, which is set to 1, indicating it holds metadata for a single link-out metric.
- **Use**: This variable is used to provide metadata for link-out metrics, facilitating the tracking and management of metrics related to outgoing links.


---
### FD\_METRICS\_TILE\_KIND\_NAMES
- **Type**: `const char *`
- **Description**: `FD_METRICS_TILE_KIND_NAMES` is an external constant array of strings, where each string represents the name of a specific tile kind in the metrics system. The array size is defined by `FD_METRICS_TILE_KIND_CNT`, which is 18.
- **Use**: This variable is used to store and provide access to the names of different tile kinds for metrics identification and reporting purposes.


---
### FD\_METRICS\_TILE\_KIND\_SIZES
- **Type**: `array of unsigned long integers (`ulong`)`
- **Description**: `FD_METRICS_TILE_KIND_SIZES` is a global constant array that holds the sizes of different tile kinds. The array is indexed by tile kind identifiers, and each element represents the size of a specific tile kind in terms of some unit, likely bytes.
- **Use**: This variable is used to store and provide access to the size information of various tile kinds, which can be used for memory allocation or management purposes.


---
### FD\_METRICS\_TILE\_KIND\_METRICS
- **Type**: `const fd_metrics_meta_t *[FD_METRICS_TILE_KIND_CNT]`
- **Description**: `FD_METRICS_TILE_KIND_METRICS` is an array of pointers to `fd_metrics_meta_t` structures, with a size defined by `FD_METRICS_TILE_KIND_CNT`. Each element in the array corresponds to a different kind of tile metric, providing metadata for that specific metric type.
- **Use**: This variable is used to store and access metadata for different types of tile metrics, allowing for organized and efficient retrieval of metric information.
