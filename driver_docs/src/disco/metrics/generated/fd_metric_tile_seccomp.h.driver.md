# Purpose
This C header file, generated by a script named `generate_filters.py`, defines a seccomp (secure computing mode) filter policy for a specific application. The primary purpose of this file is to provide a predefined set of rules that restrict the system calls an application can make, enhancing security by limiting the application's ability to perform potentially harmful operations. The file includes necessary headers for working with seccomp and BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter), and it defines a function [`populate_sock_filter_policy_fd_metric_tile`](#populate_sock_filter_policy_fd_metric_tile) that initializes a `sock_filter` array with 45 instructions. These instructions form a BPF program that enforces the seccomp policy by allowing or denying specific system calls based on the architecture and syscall arguments.

The seccomp filter is designed to allow only a specific set of system calls (`write`, `fsync`, `accept4`, `read`, `sendto`, `close`, and `poll`) under certain conditions, while any other system calls result in the process being killed (`SECCOMP_RET_KILL_PROCESS`). The filter checks the architecture to ensure compatibility and uses conditional jumps to verify syscall numbers and arguments, such as file descriptors for logging and metrics. This file is not intended to be edited manually, as indicated by the comment at the top, and it is likely part of a larger system where security and controlled access to system resources are critical.

# Global Variables

---
### sock\_filter\_policy\_fd\_metric\_tile\_instr\_cnt
- **Type**: `unsigned int`
- **Description**: The variable `sock_filter_policy_fd_metric_tile_instr_cnt` is a constant unsigned integer set to the value 45. It represents the number of instructions in a socket filter policy used for seccomp filtering.
- **Use**: This variable is used to ensure that the output buffer for the socket filter policy has enough space to accommodate all 45 instructions.


# Functions

---
### populate\_sock\_filter\_policy\_fd\_metric\_tile<!-- {{#callable:populate_sock_filter_policy_fd_metric_tile}} -->
The function `populate_sock_filter_policy_fd_metric_tile` initializes a seccomp filter to enforce a security policy on system calls based on file descriptors and architecture.
- **Inputs**:
    - `out_cnt`: The number of elements in the output filter array, expected to be at least 45.
    - `out`: A pointer to an array of `struct sock_filter` where the filter instructions will be copied.
    - `logfile_fd`: The file descriptor for the log file, used in syscall checks.
    - `metrics_socket_fd`: The file descriptor for the metrics socket, used in syscall checks.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function begins by asserting that `out_cnt` is at least 45, ensuring the output array can hold the filter instructions.
    - A static array `filter` of 45 `struct sock_filter` elements is defined to hold the seccomp filter instructions.
    - The filter checks if the architecture of the running process matches the expected architecture, jumping to a kill process instruction if not.
    - It loads the syscall number and checks against allowed syscalls like `write`, `fsync`, `accept4`, `read`, `sendto`, `close`, and `poll`, with specific conditions for each based on file descriptors.
    - For each syscall, it loads the syscall arguments and compares them against expected values, allowing or killing the process based on the results.
    - The filter ends with instructions to either kill the process or allow the syscall, depending on the conditions met.
    - Finally, the function copies the filter instructions into the provided output array using `fd_memcpy`.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it populates the provided `out` array with the seccomp filter instructions.
