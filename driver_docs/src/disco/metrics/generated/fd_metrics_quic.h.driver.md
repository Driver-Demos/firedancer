# Purpose
This C source file is a generated code file that defines a comprehensive set of metrics related to QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections) protocol operations. The file includes a series of preprocessor macros that define various metrics, such as counters and gauges, which are used to track different aspects of QUIC transactions, connections, packets, and frames. Each metric is associated with a unique offset, name, type, description, and conversion type, which are used to facilitate the monitoring and analysis of QUIC protocol performance and behavior. The metrics cover a wide range of activities, including transaction overruns, reassembly operations, packet reception and transmission, connection management, handshake processes, and error handling.

The file is intended to be included in other C source files, as indicated by the inclusion of header files like "fd_metrics_base.h" and "fd_metrics_enums.h". It does not define any public APIs or external interfaces directly but provides a structured way to access and utilize the defined metrics within a larger application or system. The metrics are likely used in conjunction with a monitoring or logging system to provide insights into the performance and reliability of QUIC-based communication. The file's content is organized around the theme of performance metrics, and it serves as a foundational component for tracking and analyzing the efficiency and effectiveness of QUIC protocol implementations.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `../fd_metrics_base.h`
- `fd_metrics_enums.h`


# Global Variables

---
### FD\_METRICS\_QUIC
- **Type**: `fd_metrics_meta_t array`
- **Description**: `FD_METRICS_QUIC` is a global constant array of type `fd_metrics_meta_t` with a size defined by `FD_METRICS_QUIC_TOTAL`. This array holds metadata for various QUIC-related metrics, such as counters and gauges, which are used to track different aspects of QUIC protocol operations, including transaction counts, connection statuses, and packet handling.
- **Use**: This variable is used to store and provide access to metadata for QUIC metrics, facilitating the monitoring and analysis of QUIC protocol performance and behavior.
