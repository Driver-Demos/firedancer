# Purpose
This C source code file is an auto-generated configuration file that defines an array of metric metadata structures, `FD_METRICS_SEND`, used for tracking various send-related metrics in a system. The file includes a header, `fd_metrics_send.h`, which likely contains necessary declarations and definitions for the metrics system. Each entry in the `FD_METRICS_SEND` array is initialized using the `DECLARE_METRIC` macro, which pairs a descriptive metric name with a type, in this case, `COUNTER`, indicating that these metrics are likely used to count occurrences of specific events, such as transactions sent to a leader or various leader-related errors. The file is not intended to be manually edited, as it is generated by a script (`gen_metrics.py`), suggesting that the metrics it contains are subject to change based on the system's evolving requirements.

### FD\_METRICS\_SEND
- **Type**: `const fd_metrics_meta_t[]`
- **Description**: FD_METRICS_SEND is a constant array of type fd_metrics_meta_t, which holds metric definitions related to sending transactions to a leader. Each element in the array is initialized using the DECLARE_METRIC macro, which specifies a metric name and its type, in this case, COUNTER. The array size is determined by the FD_METRICS_SEND_TOTAL constant.
- **Use**: This variable is used to store and manage metrics for monitoring and analyzing the process of sending transactions to a leader in a distributed system.
