# Purpose
This C source file is a generated code file that defines a set of metrics for a banking system, specifically focusing on transaction processing and error tracking. The file includes an array of `fd_metrics_meta_t` structures, each representing a specific metric related to banking operations. These metrics are categorized into counters for various transaction outcomes and errors, such as transaction sanitization failures, execution failures, and specific transaction errors like insufficient funds or invalid account data. The use of macros like `DECLARE_METRIC` and `DECLARE_METRIC_ENUM` suggests a systematic approach to defining these metrics, likely for use in monitoring and logging systems to track the performance and reliability of the banking operations.

The file is not intended to be manually edited, as indicated by the comment at the top, and is likely generated by a script (`gen_metrics.py`). This suggests that the metrics are part of a larger system where they are dynamically updated or extended as needed. The file serves as a configuration or setup component within a broader software system, providing a structured way to define and manage metrics related to banking transactions. It does not define public APIs or external interfaces directly but rather contributes to the internal infrastructure for performance monitoring and error handling within the banking application.
# Imports and Dependencies

- `fd_metrics_bank.h`


# Global Variables

### FD\_METRICS\_BANK
- **Type**: `const fd_metrics_meta_t[]`
- **Description**: `FD_METRICS_BANK` is a global constant array of type `fd_metrics_meta_t` that holds a collection of metrics related to bank transactions. Each element in the array represents a specific metric, which is defined using macros like `DECLARE_METRIC` and `DECLARE_METRIC_ENUM`. These metrics are used to track various transaction outcomes and errors, such as transaction failures, slot acquisition results, and transaction execution errors.
- **Use**: This variable is used to store and organize metrics for monitoring and analyzing bank transaction processes and outcomes.
