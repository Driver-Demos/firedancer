# Purpose
This C source code file is an auto-generated configuration file that defines an array of metric histograms related to Proof of History (PoH) timing delays. It includes a header file, "fd_metrics_poh.h," which likely contains necessary declarations and macros used in this file. The array `FD_METRICS_POH` is of type `fd_metrics_meta_t` and is initialized with several histogram metrics, each representing different delay times in seconds, such as leader delay, microblock delay, slot completion delay, and bundle initialization delay. The use of macros like `DECLARE_METRIC_HISTOGRAM_SECONDS` suggests a standardized way to define these metrics, ensuring consistency and ease of maintenance. The file is not meant to be manually edited, as indicated by the comment, and is likely part of a larger system for monitoring or analyzing PoH performance metrics.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `fd_metrics_poh.h`


# Global Variables

---
### FD\_METRICS\_POH
- **Type**: `array of `fd_metrics_meta_t``
- **Description**: `FD_METRICS_POH` is a global constant array of type `fd_metrics_meta_t`, which is used to store metrics related to Proof of History (PoH) delays. Each element in the array is initialized using the `DECLARE_METRIC_HISTOGRAM_SECONDS` macro, which likely sets up histogram metrics for different stages of PoH processing.
- **Use**: This variable is used to track and store timing metrics for various stages of the Proof of History process in a structured format.
