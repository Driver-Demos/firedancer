# Purpose
This C source file is a generated code file that defines a series of constants related to network metrics, specifically for tracking various network packet transmission and reception statistics. The file includes definitions for both counters and gauges, which are used to measure different aspects of network performance, such as the number of packets received, bytes transmitted, and various failure conditions like packet drops due to buffer overflows or routing issues. Each metric is defined with an offset, name, type, description, and a conversion type, which in this case is consistently set to `FD_METRICS_CONVERTER_NONE`, indicating no conversion is applied to the raw metric values.

The file is intended to be part of a larger system that monitors network performance, likely used in conjunction with other components that collect and process these metrics. It includes references to external header files, suggesting that it is part of a modular system where these metrics are integrated into a broader framework. The file does not define any functions or executable code but rather serves as a configuration or setup file that provides metadata for network metrics. The presence of an external declaration for `FD_METRICS_NET` indicates that this array of metric metadata is intended to be accessed by other parts of the program, likely for the purpose of initializing or updating metric values during runtime.

### FD\_METRICS\_NET
- **Type**: `fd_metrics_meta_t array`
- **Description**: `FD_METRICS_NET` is a global constant array of type `fd_metrics_meta_t` with a size defined by `FD_METRICS_NET_TOTAL`. This array holds metadata for various network-related metrics, such as packet counts, byte totals, and error counts, which are used to monitor and analyze network performance.
- **Use**: This variable is used to store and provide access to metadata for network metrics, facilitating the monitoring and analysis of network performance.
