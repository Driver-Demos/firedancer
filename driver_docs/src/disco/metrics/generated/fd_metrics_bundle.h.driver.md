# Purpose
This C header file is automatically generated by a script named `gen_metrics.py` and is not intended for manual editing. It defines a series of macros that represent various metrics related to transaction processing, packet handling, error tracking, and system resource usage within a software system. These metrics are categorized as either counters or gauges, with each metric having an associated offset, name, type, description, and conversion type. The file includes references to other header files, `fd_metrics_base.h` and `fd_metrics_enums.h`, which likely provide foundational definitions and enumerations for the metrics system. The metrics are used to monitor and report on the performance and status of the system, such as the number of transactions received, errors encountered, and resource availability, facilitating performance analysis and debugging.

### FD\_METRICS\_BUNDLE
- **Type**: `fd_metrics_meta_t array`
- **Description**: `FD_METRICS_BUNDLE` is a global constant array of type `fd_metrics_meta_t` with a size defined by `FD_METRICS_BUNDLE_TOTAL`. It holds metadata for various metrics related to transaction, packet, and bundle processing, as well as error counts and system resource usage.
- **Use**: This array is used to store and provide access to metadata for different metrics, facilitating the monitoring and analysis of system performance and errors.
