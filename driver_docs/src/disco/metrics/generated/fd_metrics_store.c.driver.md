# Purpose
This file is a C source file that is automatically generated by a script named `gen_metrics.py`, as indicated by the comment at the top. It includes a header file, `fd_metrics_store.h`, and defines a constant array `FD_METRICS_STORE` of type `fd_metrics_meta_t`. This array is initialized with a single metric, `STORE_TRANSACTIONS_INSERTED`, which is declared as a `COUNTER`. The purpose of this file is to provide a structured way to store and manage metrics, likely for performance monitoring or logging purposes, within a larger application. The use of a script to generate this file suggests that the metrics may be subject to change or expansion, and automating this process helps maintain consistency and reduce manual errors.

### FD\_METRICS\_STORE
- **Type**: ``const fd_metrics_meta_t[]``
- **Description**: `FD_METRICS_STORE` is a constant array of `fd_metrics_meta_t` structures, which is used to store metrics data. The array is initialized with metrics defined by the `DECLARE_METRIC` macro, such as `STORE_TRANSACTIONS_INSERTED` with a type of `COUNTER`. The size of the array is determined by the `FD_METRICS_STORE_TOTAL` constant.
- **Use**: This variable is used to store and manage metrics data for the application, allowing for tracking and analysis of specific metrics like transaction insertions.
