# Purpose
This C source file is a generated code file that defines a collection of metrics related to the processing of transactions and microblocks in a system. The file includes an array of `fd_metrics_meta_t` structures, each representing a specific metric. These metrics are declared using macros such as `DECLARE_METRIC`, `DECLARE_METRIC_ENUM`, and `DECLARE_METRIC_HISTOGRAM_SECONDS`, which likely expand to define the properties and types of each metric. The metrics cover a wide range of transaction processing aspects, including durations of various operations, counts of transactions and votes, and states of transaction scheduling and insertion. The file is not intended to be manually edited, as indicated by the comment at the top, and is likely part of a larger system that monitors and reports on the performance and behavior of transaction processing.

The metrics defined in this file are categorized into different types, such as counters, gauges, and histograms, and they track various states and outcomes of transaction processing. For example, there are metrics for the duration of scheduling and inserting transactions, the number of transactions per microblock, and the status of transaction scheduling. The use of enums in some metrics suggests that these metrics can take on a predefined set of values, which helps in categorizing and analyzing different transaction outcomes. This file is likely used in conjunction with other components of the system to provide detailed insights into the performance and efficiency of transaction processing, aiding in monitoring, debugging, and optimizing the system's operation.

### FD\_METRICS\_PACK
- **Type**: `const fd_metrics_meta_t[]`
- **Description**: `FD_METRICS_PACK` is a global constant array of type `fd_metrics_meta_t`, which holds a collection of metrics related to microblock and transaction processing. Each element in the array is initialized using macros that define various types of metrics, such as histograms and counters, for different aspects of the transaction and microblock lifecycle. The array is sized according to `FD_METRICS_PACK_TOTAL`, which determines the total number of metrics tracked.
- **Use**: This variable is used to store and organize metrics for monitoring and analyzing the performance and behavior of microblock and transaction processing in the system.
