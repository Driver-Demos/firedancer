- **[types.py](generate/types.py.driver.md)**: The `types.py` file in the `firedancer` codebase defines various classes and functions for handling metrics, including different metric types, their properties, and parsing them from XML data.
- **[write_codegen.py](generate/write_codegen.py.driver.md)**: The `write_codegen.py` file in the `firedancer` codebase generates C header and source files for metrics definitions, including enums and descriptors, based on the provided metrics data.
- **[write_docs.py](generate/write_docs.py.driver.md)**: The `write_docs.py` file in the `firedancer` codebase generates documentation for metrics by writing them to a Markdown file, formatting them with HTML spans for styling, and categorizing them by type and description.
