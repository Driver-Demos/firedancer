# Purpose
This code is a simple C header file that declares two thread-local (indicated by `FD_TL`) pointers to unsigned long integers. The first pointer, `fd_metrics_base_tl`, is a non-volatile pointer, suggesting it points to a base or starting address for some metrics-related data structure. The second pointer, `fd_metrics_tl`, is a volatile pointer, indicating it may be used to access data that can be changed by other threads or hardware, ensuring the compiler does not optimize away necessary reads or writes. The inclusion of `"fd_metrics.h"` suggests that these pointers are part of a larger metrics collection or monitoring system, likely used to track performance or operational metrics in a multi-threaded environment.

# Global Variables

---
### fd\_metrics\_base\_tl
- **Type**: `pointer to unsigned long`
- **Description**: The variable `fd_metrics_base_tl` is a global pointer to an unsigned long integer. It is declared with the `FD_TL` macro, which likely indicates a thread-local storage specifier, suggesting that each thread has its own instance of this pointer.
- **Use**: This variable is used to point to a base address in memory for metrics data specific to each thread.


---
### fd\_metrics\_tl
- **Type**: `volatile ulong *`
- **Description**: The `fd_metrics_tl` is a global variable that is a pointer to a volatile unsigned long integer. It is declared with the `FD_TL` macro, which likely specifies a thread-local storage class or similar attribute. The use of `volatile` indicates that the value pointed to by this pointer can be changed by something outside the control of the code section in which it appears, such as hardware or a different thread.
- **Use**: This variable is used to store a thread-local pointer to a volatile unsigned long integer, likely for metrics tracking or similar purposes in a multi-threaded environment.
