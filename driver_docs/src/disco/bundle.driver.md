## Folders
- **[generated](bundle/generated.driver.md)**: The `generated` folder in the `firedancer` codebase contains a single file, `fd_bundle_tile_seccomp.h`, which is a generated header file defining a seccomp filter policy for system call restrictions across various architectures.
- **[proto](bundle/proto.driver.md)**: The `proto` folder in the `firedancer` codebase contains protocol buffer definitions, options, and automatically generated nanopb source and header files for handling various components such as authentication, block engine operations, bundles, packets, shared resources, and timestamps, along with build configuration files like `Makefile` and `Local.mk`.
