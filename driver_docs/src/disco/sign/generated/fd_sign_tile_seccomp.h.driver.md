# Purpose
This C header file, generated by a script named `generate_filters.py`, defines a seccomp (secure computing mode) filter policy for a specific application or process. The file is not intended to be edited manually, as indicated by the comment at the top. It includes several Linux kernel headers related to auditing, capabilities, filtering, and seccomp, which are essential for defining and applying seccomp filters. The primary functionality of this file is to provide a predefined set of BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter) instructions that enforce a security policy by restricting the system calls that a process can make, based on the architecture it is running on. The file supports multiple architectures, including i386, x86_64, and aarch64, and it uses conditional compilation to set the appropriate architecture identifier.

The core function, [`populate_sock_filter_policy_fd_sign_tile`](#populate_sock_filter_policy_fd_sign_tile), initializes a `sock_filter` array with 14 BPF instructions. These instructions implement a seccomp filter that allows only specific system calls (`SYS_write` and `SYS_fsync`) under certain conditions, while terminating the process if any other system call is attempted. The filter checks the architecture of the running process and the syscall number, and it uses conditional jumps to either allow or kill the process based on these checks. This file is part of a broader security mechanism, likely used to harden applications by limiting their interaction with the operating system, thus reducing the attack surface.

# Global Variables

---
### sock\_filter\_policy\_fd\_sign\_tile\_instr\_cnt
- **Type**: `unsigned int`
- **Description**: The variable `sock_filter_policy_fd_sign_tile_instr_cnt` is a static constant of type `unsigned int` with a value of 14. It represents the number of instructions in a specific socket filter policy used for seccomp filtering.
- **Use**: This variable is used to ensure that the output buffer in the `populate_sock_filter_policy_fd_sign_tile` function has enough space to hold the 14 instructions of the seccomp filter.


# Functions

---
### populate\_sock\_filter\_policy\_fd\_sign\_tile<!-- {{#callable:populate_sock_filter_policy_fd_sign_tile}} -->
The function `populate_sock_filter_policy_fd_sign_tile` initializes a seccomp filter to restrict system calls based on architecture and specific syscall numbers, copying the filter to a provided output buffer.
- **Inputs**:
    - `out_cnt`: The number of elements in the output buffer, which must be at least 14.
    - `out`: A pointer to a buffer where the seccomp filter will be copied.
    - `logfile_fd`: The file descriptor to be checked against syscall arguments for allowing certain syscalls.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function begins by asserting that `out_cnt` is at least 14 using `FD_TEST` to ensure the output buffer is large enough.
    - A static array `filter` of 14 `sock_filter` structures is defined to hold the seccomp filter instructions.
    - The filter first checks if the architecture of the running process matches the expected architecture (`ARCH_NR`); if not, it jumps to `RET_KILL_PROCESS`.
    - It then loads the syscall number and checks if it matches `SYS_write` or `SYS_fsync`, jumping to specific labels if they match.
    - If the syscall is `SYS_write`, it checks the first argument against the value 2 and `logfile_fd`, allowing the syscall if either matches, otherwise jumping to `RET_KILL_PROCESS`.
    - If the syscall is `SYS_fsync`, it checks the first argument against `logfile_fd`, allowing the syscall if it matches, otherwise jumping to `RET_KILL_PROCESS`.
    - The default action if no conditions are met is to kill the process (`RET_KILL_PROCESS`).
    - The filter instructions are copied to the output buffer `out` using `fd_memcpy`.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it populates the provided buffer `out` with the seccomp filter instructions.
