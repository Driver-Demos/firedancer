## Folders
- **[generated](quic/generated.driver.md)**: The `generated` folder in the `firedancer` codebase contains a single file, `quic_seccomp.h`, which is a generated header file defining a seccomp filter policy for QUIC.

## Files
- **[fd_quic_tile.c](quic/fd_quic_tile.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_quic_tile.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase implements a QUIC-based TPU server tile that handles incoming transactions for inclusion in blocks, supporting both TPU/UDP and TPU/QUIC protocols, and includes functionality for defragmenting multi-packet TPU streams and managing various metrics and configurations.
- **[fd_quic_tile.h](quic/fd_quic_tile.h.driver.md)**: The `fd_quic_tile.h` file in the `firedancer` codebase defines the structure and components for handling QUIC protocol operations within a network tile, including context management, key storage, and performance metrics.
- **[fd_tpu.h](quic/fd_tpu.h.driver.md)**: The `fd_tpu.h` file in the `firedancer` codebase provides the server-side implementation of the TPU/QUIC protocol, handling transaction submission to a block producer by managing the reassembly of fragmented transactions over QUIC streams.
- **[fd_tpu_reasm.c](quic/fd_tpu_reasm.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_tpu_reasm.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase implements functions for managing and manipulating a reassembly structure for the Firedancer's QUIC protocol, including memory allocation, initialization, querying, and publishing of data slots.
- **[fd_tpu_reasm_private.h](quic/fd_tpu_reasm_private.h.driver.md)**: The `fd_tpu_reasm_private.h` file in the `firedancer` codebase contains reusable logic for the `fd_tpu_reasm` component, including functions and macros for managing reassembly slots and a least-recently-used (LRU) cache mechanism.
- **[Local.mk](quic/Local.mk.driver.md)**: The `Local.mk` file in the `firedancer` codebase specifies the headers, object files, and unit tests for the QUIC module, including conditional compilation based on the presence of double precision and SSE support.
- **[quic.seccomppolicy](quic/quic.seccomppolicy.driver.md)**: The `quic.seccomppolicy` file defines security policies for logging and randomness in the QUIC protocol, specifying conditions for writing and syncing log messages and using cryptographic randomness.
- **[test_quic_metrics.c](quic/test_quic_metrics.c.driver.md)**: The `test_quic_metrics.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase tests the QUIC metrics functionality by setting up an HTTP server, generating fake metric values, rendering them using Prometheus, and comparing the output to a fixture file.
- **[test_quic_metrics.txt](quic/test_quic_metrics.txt.driver.md)**: The `test_quic_metrics.txt` file in the `firedancer` codebase provides a comprehensive set of metrics related to QUIC transactions, connections, packets, and frames, including counts, durations, and errors, for monitoring and analysis purposes.
- **[test_tpu_reasm.c](quic/test_tpu_reasm.c.driver.md)**: The `test_tpu_reasm.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase contains a comprehensive test suite for the TPU reassembly functionality, including state verification, memory management, and transaction publishing.
