# Purpose
This C source code file is designed to test the functionality of memory protection mechanisms, specifically focusing on the allocation and handling of protected memory pages. The code includes a function `test_protected_pages` that performs a series of tests to ensure that memory protection is correctly enforced. It uses the `fd_keyload_alloc_protected_pages` function to allocate memory pages that are expected to be protected, and then deliberately attempts to access memory outside the allocated bounds to trigger segmentation faults. This is done to verify that the memory protection is functioning as intended. The code also tests the behavior of memory pages across process forks, ensuring that memory is wiped in child processes but remains intact in the parent process.

The file includes a macro `TEST_FORK_OK` to facilitate testing of child processes created via `fork()`, ensuring that they exit successfully without errors or signals. The `main` function initializes logging, runs the `test_protected_pages` function, and logs the results. This file is primarily a test suite for verifying the robustness of memory protection features, and it is likely part of a larger system where memory security is critical. The inclusion of headers like `<signal.h>`, `<unistd.h>`, and `<sys/wait.h>` indicates that the code relies on POSIX system calls for process control and signal handling. The file does not define public APIs or external interfaces but rather serves as an internal testing utility.
