## Files
- **[fd_cpu_topo.c](topo/fd_cpu_topo.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_cpu_topo.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase provides functions for initializing and printing CPU topology information, including CPU count, online status, NUMA node association, and hyperthreading sibling relationships.
- **[fd_cpu_topo.h](topo/fd_cpu_topo.h.driver.md)**: The `fd_cpu_topo.h` file defines structures and functions for managing and initializing CPU topology information in the Firedancer project.
- **[fd_topo.c](topo/fd_topo.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_topo.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase provides functions for managing and interacting with shared memory workspaces and tiles, including joining, leaving, creating, and filling workspaces, as well as logging memory usage and configuration details.
- **[fd_topo.h](topo/fd_topo.h.driver.md)**: The `fd_topo.h` file in the `firedancer` codebase defines the structure and functions for managing the topology of a Firedancer configuration, including workspaces, tiles, and links, as well as providing utilities for memory management and process execution within this topology.
- **[fd_topo_run.c](topo/fd_topo_run.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_topo_run.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase is responsible for managing the execution of tiles within a topology, including setting up logging, handling sandboxing, managing thread creation and affinity, and installing XDP programs.
- **[fd_topob.c](topo/fd_topob.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_topob.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase provides functions for creating and managing a topology of tiles, workspaces, objects, and links, including their initialization, validation, and automatic layout on CPU cores.
- **[fd_topob.h](topo/fd_topob.h.driver.md)**: The `fd_topob.h` file in the `firedancer` codebase provides a set of convenience functions for building and managing a topology, including creating tiles, objects, links, and defining their relationships and properties.
- **[Local.mk](topo/Local.mk.driver.md)**: The `Local.mk` file in the `firedancer` codebase specifies conditional inclusion of headers and object files related to topology and disco components based on the presence of hosted, threads, and Linux configurations.
