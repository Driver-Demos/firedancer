# Purpose
This C header file, `fd_plugin_tile_seccomp.h`, is a generated file that defines a seccomp (secure computing mode) filter policy for a specific application or plugin. The primary purpose of this file is to provide a predefined set of rules that restrict the system calls an application can make, enhancing security by limiting the application's ability to perform potentially harmful operations. The file includes necessary headers for working with seccomp and BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter) and defines architecture-specific constants to ensure compatibility with different CPU architectures such as x86_64, i386, and aarch64.

The core functionality is encapsulated in the [`populate_sock_filter_policy_fd_plugin_tile`](#populate_sock_filter_policy_fd_plugin_tile) function, which initializes a BPF filter array with specific rules. These rules check the architecture of the running process and allow or deny system calls based on predefined criteria. For instance, it allows `write` and `fsync` system calls under certain conditions, while any other system calls result in the process being killed. This file is not intended to be edited manually, as indicated by the comment at the top, and is likely part of a larger system where security policies are automatically generated and applied to ensure that only safe operations are permitted by the application.

# Global Variables

---
### sock\_filter\_policy\_fd\_plugin\_tile\_instr\_cnt
- **Type**: `unsigned int`
- **Description**: The variable `sock_filter_policy_fd_plugin_tile_instr_cnt` is a constant unsigned integer set to the value 14. It represents the number of instructions in a socket filter policy used for seccomp (secure computing mode) filtering.
- **Use**: This variable is used to define the expected count of instructions in the seccomp filter array, ensuring that the filter is correctly populated with the specified number of instructions.


# Functions

---
### populate\_sock\_filter\_policy\_fd\_plugin\_tile<!-- {{#callable:populate_sock_filter_policy_fd_plugin_tile}} -->
The function `populate_sock_filter_policy_fd_plugin_tile` initializes a seccomp filter to restrict system calls based on architecture and specific syscall numbers, copying the filter to the provided output buffer.
- **Inputs**:
    - `out_cnt`: The number of elements in the output buffer, which must be at least 14.
    - `out`: A pointer to a buffer where the seccomp filter will be copied.
    - `logfile_fd`: The file descriptor to be allowed for certain syscalls, specifically `write` and `fsync`.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if `out_cnt` is at least 14 using `FD_TEST` macro.
    - Define a seccomp filter array with 14 instructions.
    - The first instruction checks if the architecture of the script matches the runtime architecture; if not, it jumps to kill the process.
    - Load the syscall number and check if it is `write` or `fsync`; if not, jump to kill the process.
    - For `write`, check if the first argument is 2 or matches `logfile_fd`; if not, jump to kill the process.
    - For `fsync`, check if the first argument matches `logfile_fd`; if not, jump to kill the process.
    - If any checks fail, the process is killed; otherwise, the syscall is allowed.
    - Copy the filter array to the output buffer using `fd_memcpy`.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it populates the provided buffer with a seccomp filter.
