# Purpose
This C header file, `fd_verify_tile_seccomp.h`, is a generated file that defines a seccomp (secure computing mode) filter policy for a specific application. The primary purpose of this file is to provide a mechanism to restrict the system calls that a process can make, enhancing security by reducing the attack surface. The file includes necessary headers for seccomp and BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter) operations, and it defines a function [`populate_sock_filter_policy_fd_verify_tile`](#populate_sock_filter_policy_fd_verify_tile) that initializes a BPF filter array. This array is used to enforce rules on system calls, allowing only specific calls like `write` and `fsync` under certain conditions, and terminating the process if unauthorized calls are attempted.

The file is structured to support multiple architectures, with conditional compilation directives to define the appropriate architecture number for i386, x86_64, and aarch64 systems. The seccomp filter is implemented using BPF instructions, which are loaded into a `struct sock_filter` array. This array is then copied to the output parameter using `fd_memcpy`. The filter logic includes checks for the architecture and specific system calls, with jump instructions to either allow or kill the process based on the syscall and its arguments. This file is not intended to be edited manually, as indicated by the comment at the top, and it is likely part of a larger system where security and syscall filtering are critical.

# Global Variables

---
### sock\_filter\_policy\_fd\_verify\_tile\_instr\_cnt
- **Type**: `unsigned int`
- **Description**: The variable `sock_filter_policy_fd_verify_tile_instr_cnt` is a static constant of type `unsigned int` with a value of 14. It represents the number of instructions in a socket filter policy used for verifying a tile in a seccomp (secure computing mode) context.
- **Use**: This variable is used to ensure that the output count (`out_cnt`) in the `populate_sock_filter_policy_fd_verify_tile` function is at least 14, which matches the number of instructions in the filter array.


# Functions

---
### populate\_sock\_filter\_policy\_fd\_verify\_tile<!-- {{#callable:populate_sock_filter_policy_fd_verify_tile}} -->
The function `populate_sock_filter_policy_fd_verify_tile` initializes a BPF filter array to enforce seccomp policies for syscall filtering and copies it to the provided output buffer.
- **Inputs**:
    - `out_cnt`: The number of elements in the output buffer, which must be at least 14.
    - `out`: A pointer to a buffer where the BPF filter array will be copied.
    - `logfile_fd`: The file descriptor to be used in the BPF filter for syscall argument checks.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if `out_cnt` is at least 14 using `FD_TEST` macro.
    - Define a BPF filter array with 14 instructions to enforce seccomp policies.
    - The filter checks if the architecture matches the runtime architecture; if not, it jumps to kill the process.
    - Load the syscall number and check if it is `SYS_write` or `SYS_fsync`; if not, jump to kill the process.
    - For `SYS_write`, check if the first argument is 2 or matches `logfile_fd`; otherwise, jump to kill the process.
    - For `SYS_fsync`, check if the first argument matches `logfile_fd`; otherwise, jump to kill the process.
    - If none of the conditions are met, the process is killed.
    - Copy the filter array to the output buffer using `fd_memcpy`.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it populates the provided buffer with a BPF filter array.
