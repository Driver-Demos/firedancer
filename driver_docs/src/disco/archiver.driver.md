## Folders
- **[generated](archiver/generated.driver.md)**: The `generated` folder in the `firedancer` codebase contains generated header files that define seccomp filter policies for various components of the archiver, specifying system call rules for feeder, playback, and writer functionalities.

## Files
- **[archiver_feeder.seccomppolicy](archiver/archiver_feeder.seccomppolicy.driver.md)**: The `archiver_feeder.seccomppolicy` file in the `firedancer` codebase defines security policies for logging, specifying conditions for writing log messages to STDERR and a log file, and ensuring immediate disk synchronization for warnings and above.
- **[archiver_playback.seccomppolicy](archiver/archiver_playback.seccomppolicy.driver.md)**: The `archiver_playback.seccomppolicy` file in the `firedancer` codebase defines security policies for logging and reading operations, specifying conditions for writing to log files, reading from archive files, and synchronizing log files to disk.
- **[archiver_writer.seccomppolicy](archiver/archiver_writer.seccomppolicy.driver.md)**: The `archiver_writer.seccomppolicy` file in the `firedancer` codebase defines security policies for logging and writing operations, specifying conditions under which file descriptors for log and archive files can be written to and synchronized.
- **[fd_archiver.h](archiver/fd_archiver.h.driver.md)**: The `fd_archiver.h` file defines constants, macros, and a structure for handling fragment headers in the Firedancer archiver, including distinguishing between shred and repair input fragments.
- **[fd_archiver_feeder.c](archiver/fd_archiver_feeder.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_archiver_feeder.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase implements the functionality for archiver feeder tiles, which forward data fragments from input links to a single archiver writer tile, supporting flexible topologies like round-robin or 1-1.
- **[fd_archiver_playback.c](archiver/fd_archiver_playback.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_archiver_playback.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase implements an archiver playback tile that reads from an archive file, reproduces the timing of captured data with artificial delays, and forwards the data fragments to receiver tiles.
- **[fd_archiver_writer.c](archiver/fd_archiver_writer.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_archiver_writer.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase implements the functionality for an archiver writer tile that processes input from archiver feeder links, timestamps each fragment for global ordering, and writes them to an archive tile.
- **[Local.mk](archiver/Local.mk.driver.md)**: The `Local.mk` file in the `firedancer` codebase specifies the inclusion of headers and conditional object files for the `fd_archiver` components based on the presence of SSE support.
