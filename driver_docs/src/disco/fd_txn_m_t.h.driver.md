# Purpose
This C header file defines a data structure and associated functions for handling parsed meta transactions, specifically within a system that processes transaction bundles. The primary structure, `fd_txn_m_t`, encapsulates various attributes of a transaction, including a reference slot, payload size, and transaction size. It also includes a nested structure for handling bundle-related metadata, such as `bundle_id` and `bundle_txn_cnt`, which are crucial for managing transactions that are part of a larger bundle. The structure is designed to optimize performance by storing redundant but computationally expensive-to-derive information, such as transaction size, to avoid repeated parsing.

The file provides several inline functions to calculate memory alignment and footprint for the `fd_txn_m_t` structure, as well as to access its variable-length fields like `payload`, `txn_t`, and `alut`. These functions ensure that the data is correctly aligned in memory, which is critical for performance and correctness in low-level C programming. Additionally, the file defines macros for calculating maximum transmission unit (MTU) sizes for different stages of transaction processing, such as raw, parsed, and resolved transactions. This header file is intended to be included in other C source files, providing a well-defined interface for working with meta transactions in a transaction processing system.

# Data Structures

### fd\_txn\_m
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `reference_slot`: The computed slot number that the transaction references, defaulting to the current slot if undetermined.
    - `payload_sz`: The size of the transaction payload in bytes.
    - `txn_t_sz`: The size of the transaction type, stored redundantly for efficiency.
    - `block_engine`: A nested structure containing metadata about transaction bundles, including bundle ID, transaction count, commission, and commission public key.
- **Description**: The `fd_txn_m` structure represents a parsed meta transaction, encapsulating not only the transaction payload but also additional metadata such as the reference slot, payload size, and transaction type size. It includes a nested `block_engine` structure that provides details about transaction bundles, which are groups of transactions that can be scheduled together. This structure is designed to efficiently handle transactions by storing redundant information to avoid expensive recomputation and by supporting variable-length fields for payload, transaction type, and account address lookups.

The `fd_txn_m_align` function returns the alignment requirement of the `fd_txn_m_t` structure.
- **Inputs**: None

- **Inputs**:
    - `txnm`: A pointer to a `fd_txn_m_t` structure, which represents a parsed meta transaction.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function takes a pointer to a `fd_txn_m_t` structure as input.

- **Control Flow**:
    - The function takes a pointer to an `fd_txn_m_t` structure as input.

- **Control Flow**:
    - The function first calculates the address immediately after the `payload` array by adding `txnm->payload_sz` to the address of the `txnm` structure plus one.
    - It then aligns this address to the alignment requirements of `fd_txn_t` using `fd_ulong_align_up`.
    - Next, it adds `txnm->txn_t_sz` to the aligned address to move past the `txn_t` array.
