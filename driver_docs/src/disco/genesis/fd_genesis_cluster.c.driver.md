# Purpose
This C source code file provides functionality for identifying and naming blockchain clusters based on their genesis hash values. It defines two primary functions: [`fd_genesis_cluster_identify`](#fd_genesis_cluster_identify) and [`fd_genesis_cluster_name`](#fd_genesis_cluster_name). The [`fd_genesis_cluster_identify`](#fd_genesis_cluster_identify) function takes a string representing an expected genesis hash and compares it against predefined hash values for various blockchain environments, such as Devnet, Testnet, Mainnet Beta, Pythtest, and Pythnet. It returns an identifier for the cluster, which is of type `ulong`, corresponding to the matched environment or `FD_CLUSTER_UNKNOWN` if no match is found. The [`fd_genesis_cluster_name`](#fd_genesis_cluster_name) function takes this cluster identifier and returns a human-readable string representing the name of the cluster.

The code is designed to be part of a larger system, likely a blockchain-related application, where identifying the correct network environment is crucial. It does not define a public API or external interface but rather provides utility functions that can be used internally within the application. The use of macros like `FD_FN_PURE` and `FD_FN_CONST` suggests an emphasis on function purity and const-correctness, which are important for optimization and reliability in software development. The file is focused on a narrow functionality, specifically the identification and naming of blockchain clusters, and is likely intended to be included in other parts of a larger codebase.

# Functions

---
### fd\_genesis\_cluster\_identify<!-- {{#callable:fd_genesis_cluster_identify}} -->
The function `fd_genesis_cluster_identify` determines the cluster type based on a given genesis hash string.
- **Inputs**:
    - `expected_genesis_hash`: A constant character pointer representing the expected genesis hash to identify the cluster.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize a variable `cluster` to `FD_CLUSTER_UNKNOWN`.
    - Check if `expected_genesis_hash` is not null using `FD_LIKELY`.
    - Compare `expected_genesis_hash` with predefined genesis hash strings for different clusters using `strcmp`.
    - If a match is found, set `cluster` to the corresponding cluster constant using `FD_UNLIKELY`.
    - Return the identified `cluster` value.
- **Output**: Returns an unsigned long integer representing the identified cluster type, or `FD_CLUSTER_UNKNOWN` if no match is found.


---
### fd\_genesis\_cluster\_name<!-- {{#callable:fd_genesis_cluster_name}} -->
The `fd_genesis_cluster_name` function returns the name of a cluster as a string based on the provided cluster identifier.
- **Inputs**:
    - `cluster`: An unsigned long integer representing the cluster identifier.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function uses a switch statement to determine the cluster name based on the value of the `cluster` argument.
    - If the `cluster` matches `FD_CLUSTER_UNKNOWN`, it returns "unknown".
    - If the `cluster` matches `FD_CLUSTER_PYTHTEST`, it returns "pythtest".
    - If the `cluster` matches `FD_CLUSTER_TESTNET`, it returns "testnet".
    - If the `cluster` matches `FD_CLUSTER_DEVNET`, it returns "devnet".
    - If the `cluster` matches `FD_CLUSTER_PYTHNET`, it returns "pythnet".
    - If the `cluster` matches `FD_CLUSTER_MAINNET_BETA`, it returns "mainnet-beta".
    - If the `cluster` does not match any known identifiers, it defaults to returning "unknown".
- **Output**: A constant character pointer to a string representing the name of the cluster.
