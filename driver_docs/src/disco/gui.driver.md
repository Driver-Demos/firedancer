## Folders
- **[dist](gui/dist.driver.md)**: The `dist` folder in the `firedancer` codebase contains essential components for the Firedancer GUI, including assets for styling and functionality, the main HTML structure, and documentation of third-party dependencies.
- **[generated](gui/generated.driver.md)**: The `generated` folder in the `firedancer` codebase contains generated files related to seccomp filters for security policies and static HTTP file representations, specifically for ARM64 architecture and GUI tiles.

## Files
- **[bandwidth.py](gui/bandwidth.py.driver.md)**: The `bandwidth.py` file in the `firedancer` codebase provides an asynchronous function to measure and print the incoming bandwidth from a WebSocket connection, categorized by topic and key.
- **[fd_gui.c](gui/fd_gui.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_gui.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase implements a graphical user interface for monitoring and managing various aspects of a distributed system, including handling WebSocket connections, processing plugin messages, managing slot and transaction data, and broadcasting updates to connected clients.
- **[fd_gui.h](gui/fd_gui.h.driver.md)**: The `fd_gui.h` file in the `firedancer` codebase defines the structures, constants, and function prototypes for managing and interacting with a graphical user interface (GUI) related to transaction processing, slot management, and network communication within the `firedancer` system.
- **[fd_gui_printf.c](gui/fd_gui_printf.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_gui_printf.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase provides functions for formatting and outputting JSONP data related to various GUI elements, including query responses, version information, cluster details, and transaction statistics.
- **[fd_gui_printf.h](gui/fd_gui_printf.h.driver.md)**: The `fd_gui_printf.h` file in the `firedancer` codebase defines functions for formatting and sending the current state of the GUI as JSON messages to WebSocket clients.
- **[fd_gui_tile.c](gui/fd_gui_tile.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_gui_tile.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase implements the GUI tile functionality, including HTTP server setup, WebSocket handling, and static asset management, with support for Zstandard compression and seccomp filtering.
- **[fd_gui_tile.seccomppolicy](gui/fd_gui_tile.seccomppolicy.driver.md)**: The `fd_gui_tile.seccomppolicy` file in the `firedancer` codebase defines security policies for logging and HTTP server operations, specifying rules for file descriptor usage related to logging, accepting, reading, writing, closing, and polling connections.
- **[fd_gui_tile_arm64.seccomppolicy](gui/fd_gui_tile_arm64.seccomppolicy.driver.md)**: The `fd_gui_tile_arm64.seccomppolicy` file in the `firedancer` codebase defines security policies for ARM64 architecture, detailing file descriptor operations for logging and HTTP server functionalities, while noting the absence of the 'poll' syscall for ARM64.
- **[Local.mk](gui/Local.mk.driver.md)**: The `Local.mk` file in the `firedancer` codebase specifies build instructions for the GUI components, including header and object files, conditional on the presence of `FD_HAS_INT128` and `FD_HAS_SSE` flags.
- **[sankey_debug.py](gui/sankey_debug.py.driver.md)**: The `sankey_debug.py` file in the `firedancer` codebase is a script that scrapes Prometheus metrics from a given URL, parses the data, and prints a detailed Sankey diagram of various transaction metrics and their flow through different stages.
