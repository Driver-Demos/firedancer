# Purpose
This C header file defines structures and constants for managing a QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections) tile within a network application. It includes several other headers that provide necessary types and functions related to network topology, transmission, and processing units. The file defines a maximum input limit for QUIC tiles and declares an external variable `fd_tile_quic` of type `fd_topo_run_tile_t`, which likely represents a runnable tile in the network topology. The core of the file is the `fd_quic_ctx_t` structure, which encapsulates various components and metrics needed for handling QUIC connections, such as reassembly contexts, cryptographic keys, buffers, and network transmission details. This structure also includes a set of metrics for monitoring the performance and status of QUIC transactions, providing a comprehensive framework for managing QUIC-based communication in a networked application.
# Imports and Dependencies

# Global Variables

---
### fd\_tile\_quic
- **Type**: `fd_topo_run_tile_t`
- **Description**: The variable `fd_tile_quic` is a global variable of type `fd_topo_run_tile_t`, which is likely a structure or typedef defined elsewhere in the codebase. It is declared as an external variable, indicating that it is defined in another source file and is used across multiple files in the project.
- **Use**: This variable is used to represent or manage a QUIC tile within the application's topology, facilitating communication or processing tasks related to QUIC protocol operations.
