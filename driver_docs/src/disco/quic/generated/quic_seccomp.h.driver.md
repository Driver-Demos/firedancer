# Purpose
This C header file, `quic_seccomp.h`, is a generated file that defines a seccomp (secure computing mode) filter policy for a QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections) application. The file is not intended to be edited manually, as indicated by the comment at the top. It includes several Linux headers related to auditing, capabilities, filtering, and seccomp, which are essential for defining and applying seccomp filters. The file is designed to be included in other C source files, providing a predefined set of seccomp rules that restrict the system calls a process can make, enhancing security by minimizing the attack surface.

The core functionality of this file is encapsulated in the [`populate_sock_filter_policy_quic`](#populate_sock_filter_policy_quic) function, which initializes a `sock_filter` array with a specific set of BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter) instructions. These instructions enforce a policy that allows only certain system calls (`write`, `fsync`, and `getrandom`) under specific conditions, while any other system calls result in the process being killed. The policy is architecture-specific, with checks to ensure the runtime architecture matches the expected one. This file is part of a broader security mechanism, likely used in a larger application to ensure that only safe and necessary system calls are executed, thereby protecting the application from potential exploits.

# Global Variables

---
### sock\_filter\_policy\_quic\_instr\_cnt
- **Type**: `unsigned int`
- **Description**: The `sock_filter_policy_quic_instr_cnt` is a static constant unsigned integer that represents the number of instructions in a socket filter policy for QUIC. It is set to the value 15, indicating the number of BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter) instructions used in the filter array within the `populate_sock_filter_policy_quic` function.
- **Use**: This variable is used to ensure that the output count (`out_cnt`) in the `populate_sock_filter_policy_quic` function is sufficient to hold all the BPF instructions defined in the filter array.


# Functions

---
### populate\_sock\_filter\_policy\_quic<!-- {{#callable:populate_sock_filter_policy_quic}} -->
The function `populate_sock_filter_policy_quic` initializes a seccomp filter policy for QUIC by populating a given array with predefined BPF instructions to control system call permissions.
- **Inputs**:
    - `out_cnt`: The number of elements in the output array, which must be at least 15.
    - `out`: A pointer to an array of `struct sock_filter` where the filter policy will be stored.
    - `logfile_fd`: The file descriptor for the log file, used to allow specific system calls based on this descriptor.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function begins by asserting that `out_cnt` is at least 15, ensuring the output array can hold the filter policy.
    - A static array `filter` of 15 `struct sock_filter` elements is defined, each representing a BPF instruction.
    - The filter checks if the architecture of the script matches the runtime architecture, jumping to `RET_KILL_PROCESS` if not.
    - It loads the syscall number and checks if it matches `SYS_write`, `SYS_fsync`, or `SYS_getrandom`, allowing them under certain conditions.
    - For `SYS_write`, it checks if the first argument is 2 or matches `logfile_fd`, allowing the call if true.
    - For `SYS_fsync`, it checks if the first argument matches `logfile_fd`, allowing the call if true.
    - If none of the conditions are met, the process is killed by default.
    - The filter is copied to the output array using `fd_memcpy`.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it populates the `out` array with the seccomp filter policy.
