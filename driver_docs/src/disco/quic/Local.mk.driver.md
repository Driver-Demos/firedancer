# Purpose
The provided content is from a Makefile, which is a build automation tool used to manage the build process of a software project. This Makefile uses a series of macros and conditional statements to organize the compilation and testing of different components within the project. The `add-hdrs` and `add-objs` macros are used to specify header files and object files that need to be included in the build process. The `make-unit-test` and `run-unit-test` macros are employed to define and execute unit tests for specific modules, such as `test_tpu_reasm` and `test_quic_metrics`, ensuring that the code functions correctly. Conditional compilation is also present, as seen with the `ifdef` directives, which check for the presence of certain features (e.g., `FD_HAS_DOUBLE`, `FD_HAS_SSE`, `FD_HAS_ALLOCA`) before including additional headers or objects, allowing for flexible and optimized builds based on the system's capabilities.
