# Purpose
This code is a C header file that defines a structure and an external array for handling static HTTP files, likely used in a web server or application that serves static content. The `fd_http_static_file` structure contains metadata about a static file, including its name, raw data, data length, compressed data using Zstandard (zstd), and the length of the compressed data. The typedef `fd_http_static_file_t` provides a shorthand for referring to this structure. Additionally, the file declares an external array `STATIC_FILES`, which is null-terminated and presumably holds multiple instances of `fd_http_static_file_t`, allowing the program to manage and access a collection of static files efficiently.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `../../../util/fd_util.h`


# Global Variables

---
### STATIC\_FILES
- **Type**: `fd_http_static_file_t[]`
- **Description**: `STATIC_FILES` is an external array of `fd_http_static_file_t` structures, which is null-terminated. Each element in the array represents a static file with its name, data, data length, compressed data, and compressed data length.
- **Use**: This variable is used to store and manage a collection of static files, likely for serving over HTTP, with support for both raw and compressed data.


# Data Structures

---
### fd\_http\_static\_file
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `name`: A pointer to a constant character string representing the name of the static file.
    - `data`: A pointer to a constant unsigned character array containing the file's raw data.
    - `data_len`: A pointer to a constant unsigned long integer representing the length of the raw data.
    - `zstd_data`: A pointer to a constant unsigned character array containing the Zstandard compressed data of the file.
    - `zstd_data_len`: An unsigned long integer representing the length of the Zstandard compressed data.
- **Description**: The `fd_http_static_file` structure is designed to represent a static file in an HTTP context, containing both the raw and compressed data of the file. It includes pointers to the file's name, its raw data, and the length of this data, as well as pointers to the Zstandard compressed version of the data and its length. This structure is useful for managing static files that need to be served over HTTP, allowing for efficient storage and retrieval of both uncompressed and compressed file data.

### fd\_http\_static\_file\_t
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `name`: A pointer to a constant character string representing the name of the static file.
    - `data`: A pointer to a constant unsigned character array containing the raw data of the static file.
    - `data_len`: A pointer to a constant unsigned long integer representing the length of the raw data.
    - `zstd_data`: A pointer to a constant unsigned character array containing the Zstandard compressed data of the static file.
    - `zstd_data_len`: An unsigned long integer representing the length of the Zstandard compressed data.
- **Description**: The `fd_http_static_file_t` structure is designed to represent a static file in an HTTP context, containing both the raw and compressed data of the file. It includes pointers to the file's name, its raw data, and its compressed data using the Zstandard compression algorithm, along with their respective lengths. This structure is part of a larger system that likely serves static files over HTTP, with an array of such structures (`STATIC_FILES`) indicating multiple files available for serving.
