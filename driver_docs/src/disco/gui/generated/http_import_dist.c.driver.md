# Purpose
This C source code file is automatically generated and is designed to facilitate the inclusion of static assets into a software project, likely a web application. The file imports various binary assets such as SVG images, JavaScript files, CSS files, font files, an HTML file, and a license file using the `FD_IMPORT_BINARY` macro. These assets are then organized into an array of `fd_http_static_file_t` structures, which map each asset to a corresponding name and data length. This setup allows the assets to be served as static files, likely through an HTTP server component of the application.

The primary technical component of this file is the `STATIC_FILES` array, which acts as a registry of all the static assets that the application can serve. Each entry in the array contains metadata about the asset, including its path and size, which is essential for efficient file serving. This file does not define public APIs or external interfaces directly but rather serves as a backend utility to manage and serve static content within the application. The inclusion of a license file in the assets suggests that the application may also provide information about third-party dependencies or licensing terms.

### STATIC\_FILES
- **Type**: `fd_http_static_file_t[]`
- **Description**: The `STATIC_FILES` variable is an array of `fd_http_static_file_t` structures, each representing a static file resource used in an HTTP server context. Each element in the array contains the file's name, a pointer to its binary data, and a pointer to the size of the data. The array is terminated with a zeroed structure to indicate the end of the list.
- **Use**: This variable is used to store and manage static file resources for serving over HTTP.
