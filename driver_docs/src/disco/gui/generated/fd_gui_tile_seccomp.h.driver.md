# Purpose
This C header file, `fd_gui_tile_seccomp.h`, is a generated file that defines a seccomp (secure computing mode) filter policy for a GUI application. The primary purpose of this file is to establish a set of rules that restrict the system calls that the application can make, enhancing security by limiting the application's ability to perform potentially harmful operations. The file includes necessary headers for working with seccomp and BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter) and defines architecture-specific constants to ensure compatibility with different CPU architectures such as i386, x86_64, and aarch64.

The core functionality of this file is encapsulated in the [`populate_sock_filter_policy_fd_gui_tile`](#populate_sock_filter_policy_fd_gui_tile) function, which initializes a BPF filter array with 47 instructions. These instructions define a policy that allows or denies specific system calls based on their numbers and arguments. The filter checks for system calls like `write`, `fsync`, `accept4`, `read`, `sendto`, `close`, and `poll`, and applies conditions to determine whether to allow or kill the process making the call. This is achieved by loading syscall numbers and arguments into the BPF accumulator and using conditional jumps to either allow the syscall or terminate the process. The file is intended to be included in other C source files, providing a predefined seccomp policy that can be applied to enhance the security of the GUI application by preventing unauthorized system interactions.

# Global Variables

---
### sock\_filter\_policy\_fd\_gui\_tile\_instr\_cnt
- **Type**: `unsigned int`
- **Description**: The variable `sock_filter_policy_fd_gui_tile_instr_cnt` is a static constant of type `unsigned int` with a value of 47. It represents the number of instructions in a socket filter policy used for seccomp (secure computing mode) filtering.
- **Use**: This variable is used to ensure that the output buffer for the socket filter policy has enough space to hold all 47 instructions.


# Functions

---
### populate\_sock\_filter\_policy\_fd\_gui\_tile<!-- {{#callable:populate_sock_filter_policy_fd_gui_tile}} -->
The function `populate_sock_filter_policy_fd_gui_tile` initializes a seccomp filter to restrict system calls based on specific conditions and copies it to the provided output buffer.
- **Inputs**:
    - `out_cnt`: The number of elements in the output buffer, which must be at least 47.
    - `out`: A pointer to a buffer where the seccomp filter will be copied.
    - `logfile_fd`: The file descriptor for the logfile, used in syscall checks.
    - `gui_socket_fd`: The file descriptor for the GUI socket, used in syscall checks.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if `out_cnt` is at least 47, ensuring the output buffer is large enough.
    - Define a seccomp filter array with 47 instructions to restrict system calls based on architecture and specific syscall numbers.
    - For each syscall, load the syscall number and arguments, and perform conditional jumps to allow or kill the process based on the file descriptors and syscall arguments.
    - Copy the defined filter array to the output buffer using `fd_memcpy`.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it populates the provided buffer with a seccomp filter.
