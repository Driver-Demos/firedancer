# Purpose
This file is a Makefile segment that conditionally includes headers and object files for compilation based on the presence of `FD_HAS_INT128` and `FD_HAS_SSE` flags. It specifies dependencies for building the `fd_gui_tile.o` object file, indicating that it relies on the `book/public/fire.svg` file.
