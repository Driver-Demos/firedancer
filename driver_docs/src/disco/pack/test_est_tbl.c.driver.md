# Purpose
This C source code file is an executable program designed to test and validate the functionality of an estimation table, likely part of a larger library or system. The code includes the necessary headers and defines a main function that initializes a random number generator and performs a series of tests on the estimation table. The primary purpose of the program is to ensure that the estimation table correctly handles different statistical distributions, including normal and exponential distributions, and mixed distributions. The tests involve updating the table with data points and verifying that the estimated means and variances fall within expected ranges, using statistical properties and predefined thresholds.

The code is structured around a series of tests that are logged and validated using assertions. It uses a custom random number generator to simulate data points from various distributions, which are then fed into the estimation table. The program checks the alignment and footprint of the table, ensuring it meets specific requirements. It also verifies that the table returns default values when queried with no data and that it accurately estimates statistical properties when populated with data. The use of logging and assertions indicates that this code is intended for debugging and validation purposes, providing a robust mechanism to ensure the reliability and accuracy of the estimation table's implementation.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `math.h`
- `fd_est_tbl.h`


# Global Variables

---
### scratch
- **Type**: `uchar array`
- **Description**: The `scratch` variable is a static array of unsigned characters (uchar) with a size determined by the macro `FD_EST_TBL_FOOTPRINT(TBL_SZ)`. It is aligned according to the alignment specified by `FD_EST_TBL_ALIGN`. This array serves as a memory buffer for the estimation table operations.
- **Use**: The `scratch` array is used as a memory buffer to initialize and manage the estimation table (`fd_est_tbl`) in the program.


# Functions

---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function initializes a random number generator and an estimation table, performs statistical tests on various distributions, and validates the results against expected statistical properties.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments passed to the program.
    - `argv`: An array of strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize the program environment with `fd_boot` and set up a random number generator `rng`.
    - Verify alignment and footprint of the estimation table using `FD_TEST`.
    - Create and join an estimation table `tbl` with a default value of 1234.
    - Test the estimation table with an empty query to ensure it returns the default value.
    - Update the table with values and test the estimation for a single entry normal distribution in bin 1.
    - Calculate and validate the mean and variance for a normal distribution with known parameters.
    - Test the estimation table with an exponential distribution in bin 2, validating the mean and variance.
    - Simulate mixed distributions in bins 3 to 7, updating the table and validating the results against analytic expectations.
    - Delete the random number generator and halt the program.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer status code, typically 0, indicating successful execution.
