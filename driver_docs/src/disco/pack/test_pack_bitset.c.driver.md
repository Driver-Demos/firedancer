# Purpose
This C source code file is an executable program designed to test the functionality of a bitset manipulation library. The code includes the necessary headers to access the bitset operations and initializes the environment using `fd_boot`. The main function systematically tests various operations on bitsets, such as setting, clearing, and checking bits, as well as performing logical operations like OR and intersection. The program uses macros like `FD_PACK_BITSET_DECLARE`, `FD_PACK_BITSET_SETN`, `FD_PACK_BITSET_CLEARN`, and `FD_PACK_BITSET_ISNULL` to manipulate and verify the state of bitsets. It also includes tests for edge cases, such as setting out-of-bounds bits, to ensure robustness.

The code is structured to provide comprehensive coverage of the bitset library's capabilities, ensuring that each function behaves as expected. It uses assertions (`FD_TEST`) to validate the outcomes of operations, logging the results to provide feedback on the test status. The program concludes by logging a "pass" message if all tests are successful and then gracefully shuts down the environment with `fd_halt`. This file serves as a critical component in verifying the correctness and reliability of the bitset library, making it an essential part of the software's testing suite.

# Functions

---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function initializes and tests various operations on packed bitsets, including setting, clearing, copying, and checking intersections, while logging the results.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments.
    - `argv`: An array of command-line argument strings.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize the environment with `fd_boot` using command-line arguments.
    - Log the current bitset mode using `FD_LOG_NOTICE`.
    - Declare and clear a bitset `x`, then test setting and clearing each bit within the range of `FD_PACK_BITSET_MAX`.
    - Attempt to set out-of-bounds bits and verify that they do not affect the bitset state.
    - Declare and clear another bitset `y`, then perform bitwise OR operations with `x` and test the results.
    - Copy bitset `y` to `x` and verify the clearing of bits in reverse order.
    - Declare additional bitsets `z` and `w`, clear them, and test intersection operations among four bitsets.
    - Log a success message and halt the program with `fd_halt`.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer value of 0, indicating successful execution.
