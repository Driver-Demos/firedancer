# Purpose
This C source code file is designed to test the functionality of a blacklist checking mechanism for public keys encoded in Base58. The code includes a [`main`](#main) function, indicating that it is an executable program. It utilizes functions from external libraries, such as `fd_base58_decode_32` for decoding Base58-encoded public keys and `fd_pack_tip_prog_check_blacklist` to verify if a given public key is blacklisted. The [`test`](#test) function is a static inline function that decodes a Base58 public key, checks it against a blacklist, and verifies the result against expected values for both bundled and non-bundled transactions. The program tests various public keys, categorized into mainnet, testnet programs, tip payment accounts, and arbitrary accounts, to ensure the blacklist checking mechanism works as intended.

The code imports headers from a broader codebase, suggesting it is part of a larger project, possibly related to blockchain or cryptocurrency systems, given the use of public keys and Base58 encoding. The primary technical components include the decoding of Base58 public keys and the validation of these keys against a blacklist. The program does not define public APIs or external interfaces but rather serves as a test suite to validate the blacklist functionality. The use of `FD_TEST` macros indicates a testing framework is in place, and the program logs a notice upon successful execution of all tests, ensuring that the blacklist mechanism is functioning correctly.

# Functions

---
### test<!-- {{#callable:test}} -->
The `test` function decodes a Base58 public key and verifies if it is correctly blacklisted based on the provided ban conditions for bundles and non-bundles.
- **Inputs**:
    - `base58_pubkey`: A constant character pointer representing the Base58 encoded public key to be decoded and checked.
    - `banned_for_bundles`: An integer flag indicating if the public key is banned for bundles (1 for banned, 0 for not banned).
    - `banned_for_nonbundles`: An integer flag indicating if the public key is banned for non-bundles (1 for banned, 0 for not banned).
- **Control Flow**:
    - Declare a variable `pubkey` of type `fd_acct_addr_t` to store the decoded public key.
    - Call `fd_base58_decode_32` to decode the `base58_pubkey` into `pubkey->b` and assert the success of this operation using `FD_TEST`.
    - Calculate the `expected` value by combining the `banned_for_bundles` and `banned_for_nonbundles` flags into a single integer using bitwise operations.
    - Call [`fd_pack_tip_prog_check_blacklist`](fd_pack_tip_prog_blacklist.h.driver.md#fd_pack_tip_prog_check_blacklist) with `pubkey` to check its blacklist status and assert that it matches the `expected` value using `FD_TEST`.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it performs assertions to verify the correctness of the blacklist status.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`fd_pack_tip_prog_check_blacklist`](fd_pack_tip_prog_blacklist.h.driver.md#fd_pack_tip_prog_check_blacklist)


---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function initializes the environment, tests a series of public keys against a blacklist, logs a success message, and then halts the program.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: An integer representing the number of command-line arguments.
    - `argv`: An array of strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Call `fd_boot` to initialize the environment with command-line arguments.
    - Invoke the [`test`](#test) function multiple times with different public keys and ban status flags to check against a blacklist.
    - Log a notice message indicating success using `FD_LOG_NOTICE`.
    - Call `fd_halt` to terminate the program.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer value of 0, indicating successful execution.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`test`](#test)
