# Purpose
This C header file defines a blacklist mechanism for managing transaction permissions in a blockchain or distributed ledger environment, specifically focusing on tip payment programs. The file is structured to provide a perfect hash map implementation that categorizes account addresses into different levels of transaction permissions. The primary functionality is to determine whether a given account address is allowed to participate in transactions, with specific rules for bundle and non-bundle transactions. The blacklist is divided into two categories: one for transactions originating from bundles and another for those that do not. This distinction is crucial to prevent unauthorized access to tip payment programs and accounts, thereby mitigating potential attacks where a malicious actor could redirect tips to themselves.

The file includes several macro definitions that set up the perfect hash map, which is used to efficiently check if an account address is blacklisted. The [`fd_pack_tip_prog_check_blacklist`](#fd_pack_tip_prog_check_blacklist) function is the core component that checks an account's status against the blacklist, returning a value that indicates the level of restriction applied to the account. The return values are designed to facilitate easy aggregation using bitwise operations, enhancing performance. The file also includes a series of predefined account addresses for both mainnet and testnet environments, which are used in the blacklist checks. This header file is intended to be included in other C source files, providing a reusable and efficient mechanism for transaction permission management in systems that utilize a bundle engine.

# Functions

---
### fd\_pack\_tip\_prog\_check\_blacklist<!-- {{#callable:fd_pack_tip_prog_check_blacklist}} -->
The function `fd_pack_tip_prog_check_blacklist` determines if a transaction using a specified account address is allowed based on a blacklist check.
- **Inputs**:
    - `acct`: A pointer to a `fd_acct_addr_t` structure representing the account address to be checked against the blacklist.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function calls `fd_pack_tip_prog_blacklist_hash_or_default` with the account address to obtain a hash value.
    - It then evaluates the hash value to determine the return value: if the hash is `UINT_MAX`, it returns 0; if the hash is less than or equal to 1, it returns 3; otherwise, it returns 1.
- **Output**: An integer value indicating the blacklist status of the account: 0 if allowed in any transaction, 1 if forbidden for non-bundle transactions but allowed for bundle transactions, and 3 if forbidden for both bundle and non-bundle transactions.
