# Purpose
The provided C header file, `fd_pack_pacing.h`, is designed to manage the pacing of computational unit (CU) consumption during transaction packing in a block. This file is part of a larger system that likely deals with transaction processing, possibly in a blockchain or distributed ledger context, where efficient and timely transaction packing is crucial. The primary functionality of this code is to ensure that the consumption of CUs is paced in such a way that the block is filled optimally, avoiding the inclusion of non-ideal transactions and ensuring that lucrative transactions arriving towards the end of a block are not unnecessarily delayed. This is achieved by calculating the number of active banks required at any given time to process transactions efficiently within a block's time constraints.

The file defines a structure, `fd_pack_pacing_t`, which holds information about the block's timing and CU limits. It provides several inline functions to initialize the pacing ([`fd_pack_pacing_init`](#fd_pack_pacing_init)), update the consumed CUs ([`fd_pack_pacing_update_consumed_cus`](#fd_pack_pacing_update_consumed_cus)), and compute the number of banks that should be active at a given time ([`fd_pack_pacing_enabled_bank_cnt`](#fd_pack_pacing_enabled_bank_cnt)). These functions are designed to be efficient and are likely intended for use in performance-critical sections of the code. The header file does not define a public API or external interfaces directly but provides essential internal mechanisms for managing transaction pacing, which can be integrated into a larger transaction processing system.
# Data Structures

---
### fd\_pack\_pacing\_private
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `t_start`: Represents the start time of a block in ticks.
    - `t_end`: Represents the end time of a block in ticks.
    - `max_cus`: Indicates the maximum number of Compute Units (CUs) in the block.
    - `ticks_per_cu`: Specifies the number of ticks per Compute Unit.
    - `remaining_cus`: Tracks the remaining Compute Units available in the block.
- **Description**: The `fd_pack_pacing_private` structure is designed to manage the pacing of Compute Unit (CU) consumption within a block of transactions. It includes fields to track the start and end times of the block, the maximum number of CUs that can be processed, and the rate of ticks per CU. This structure is crucial for ensuring that transactions are optimally packed within the block time, preventing delays of lucrative transactions to subsequent blocks. The pacing mechanism helps in efficiently utilizing available resources by adjusting the number of active banks based on the current consumption and time elapsed.

### fd\_pack\_pacing\_t
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `t_start`: Start time of the block in ticks.
    - `t_end`: End time of the block in ticks.
    - `max_cus`: Maximum number of Compute Units (CUs) in the block.
    - `ticks_per_cu`: Number of ticks per Compute Unit.
    - `remaining_cus`: Number of remaining Compute Units available for the block.
- **Description**: The `fd_pack_pacing_t` structure is designed to manage the pacing of Compute Unit (CU) consumption within a block of transactions. It ensures that the block is filled with optimal transactions by controlling the timing and number of CUs used. The structure includes fields for the start and end times of the block, the maximum number of CUs allowed, the rate of ticks per CU, and the remaining CUs available. This pacing mechanism helps in efficiently utilizing the block time and avoiding delays for lucrative transactions arriving towards the end of a block.


# Functions

---
### fd\_pack\_pacing\_init<!-- {{#callable:fd_pack_pacing_init}} -->
The `fd_pack_pacing_init` function initializes a pacing structure for managing compute unit (CU) consumption over a specified time interval.
- **Inputs**:
    - `pacer`: A pointer to an `fd_pack_pacing_t` structure that will be initialized.
    - `t_start`: The start time of the pacing interval, in ticks.
    - `t_end`: The end time of the pacing interval, in ticks.
    - `ticks_per_ns`: The number of ticks per nanosecond, used to calculate time per CU.
    - `max_cus`: The maximum number of compute units (CUs) that can be consumed in the interval.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Assigns the start and end times (`t_start` and `t_end`) to the `pacer` structure.
    - Calculates the `ticks_per_cu` as 9 times the `ticks_per_ns`, representing the time per CU.
    - Adjusts `max_cus` to ensure the pacing ends 5% before `t_end`, based on the calculated `ticks_per_cu`.
    - Sets `remaining_cus` to the adjusted `max_cus`.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it initializes the provided `fd_pack_pacing_t` structure with calculated pacing parameters.

### fd\_pack\_pacing\_update\_consumed\_cus<!-- {{#callable:fd_pack_pacing_update_consumed_cus}} -->
The function `fd_pack_pacing_update_consumed_cus` updates the remaining compute units (CUs) in a pacing structure by subtracting the consumed CUs from the maximum allowed, ensuring the result is not negative.
- **Inputs**:
    - `pacer`: A pointer to an `fd_pack_pacing_t` structure that holds pacing information, including the maximum and remaining CUs.
    - `consumed_cus`: An unsigned long integer representing the number of compute units that have been consumed.
    - `now`: A long integer representing the current time in the same time unit as the pacing structure, though it is not used in the function's logic.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function begins by casting the `now` parameter to void, indicating it is unused in the current implementation.
    - It calculates the remaining CUs by subtracting `consumed_cus` from `pacer->max_cus`, ensuring the result is not less than zero using the `fmaxf` function.
    - The result is stored in `pacer->remaining_cus`.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it updates the `remaining_cus` field of the `fd_pack_pacing_t` structure pointed to by `pacer`.


---
### fd\_pack\_pacing\_enabled\_bank\_cnt<!-- {{#callable:fd_pack_pacing_enabled_bank_cnt}} -->
The function `fd_pack_pacing_enabled_bank_cnt` calculates the number of bank tiles that should be active at a given time to efficiently fill a block within a specified time frame.
- **Inputs**:
    - `pacer`: A pointer to a `fd_pack_pacing_t` structure containing pacing information such as remaining CUs, end time, and ticks per CU.
    - `now`: A long integer representing the current time in the same time unit as `t_end` in the `fd_pack_pacing_t` structure.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function calculates the time remaining by subtracting `now` from `pacer->t_end` and ensures it is at least 1 to avoid division by zero.
    - It computes the number of active banks by dividing `pacer->remaining_cus` by the product of the time remaining and `pacer->ticks_per_cu`.
    - The result is cast to an unsigned long and returned as the number of banks to be enabled.
- **Output**: The function returns an unsigned long integer representing the number of bank tiles that should be active at the given time.
