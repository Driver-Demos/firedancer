# Purpose
This Python script is designed to model and optimize the execution times of microblocks in a transaction processing system, specifically focusing on the throughput of transactions. It uses the SageMath library to perform symbolic mathematics and calculus operations. The script defines a mathematical model where microblock execution times are a linear function of the number of transactions, with parameters for overhead and marginal per-transaction cost. It assumes transaction arrivals follow a Poisson process, characterized by a rate parameter. The script calculates the expected throughput by considering the number of transactions executed over the wait and execution time, and it determines the optimal wait time that maximizes this throughput by solving the derivative of the expected throughput function.

The script iterates over possible numbers of initial transactions, computes the optimal wait time for each scenario, and stores these values in a list. The results are then written to a binary file named 'pack_delay.bin' using the `struct` module, which packs the data into a specific binary format. This file likely serves as a configuration or input for another component of the system, possibly a simulator or a real-time processing engine. The script is a specialized tool, not a general-purpose library, and it does not define public APIs or external interfaces. Its primary purpose is to precompute and store optimal delay values for microblock scheduling to enhance transaction throughput efficiency.

# Global Variables

### MAX\_TXN\_PER\_MICROBLOCK
- **Type**: `Integer`
- **Description**: `MAX_TXN_PER_MICROBLOCK` is a global variable defined as an integer with a value of 31. It represents the maximum number of transactions that can be included in a microblock.
- **Use**: This variable is used to set a limit on the number of transactions processed in a microblock, influencing the calculation of expected throughput and execution times.


---
### ex\_expr
- **Type**: `Expression`
- **Description**: The variable `ex_expr` is a symbolic expression defined using the SageMath library. It represents the expected throughput of transactions in a microblock, modeled as a sum of two series. The first series calculates the expected value of transactions executed over the wait and execution time for a range of additional transactions, while the second series accounts for the remaining transactions up to infinity.
- **Use**: This variable is used to model and compute the expected throughput of transactions in a microblock, which is then used to determine the optimal scheduling delay for microblocks.


---
### a
- **Type**: `int`
- **Description**: The variable `a` is an integer set to 900, representing the per-microblock overhead in microseconds. It is used in the calculation of microblock execution times, which are modeled as a linear function of the number of transactions in the microblock.
- **Use**: `a` is used to calculate the execution time of microblocks by adding a constant overhead to the time required for processing transactions.


---
### b
- **Type**: `int`
- **Description**: The variable `b` is an integer set to the value 5. It represents the marginal per-transaction cost in microseconds when modeling microblock execution times.
- **Use**: `b` is used in the calculation of execution times for microblocks, specifically as a factor in the linear function that models the cost per transaction.


---
### r
- **Type**: `int`
- **Description**: The variable `r` is an integer that represents the expected rate of transaction arrivals in a Poisson process, measured in transactions per microsecond. It is used in the calculation of expected throughput and delay in a microblock execution model.
- **Use**: `r` is used to model transaction arrival rates in the Poisson process for calculating expected throughput and delay in microblock execution.


---
### ns\_delay
- **Type**: `list`
- **Description**: The `ns_delay` variable is a list that stores delay values in nanoseconds for different numbers of transactions in a microblock, ranging from 0 to `MAX_TXN_PER_MICROBLOCK`. The first element is set to the maximum unsigned long value, and subsequent elements are calculated based on a Poisson distribution model to optimize microblock execution times.
- **Use**: This variable is used to store and later write the calculated delay values to a binary file for use in microblock scheduling.
