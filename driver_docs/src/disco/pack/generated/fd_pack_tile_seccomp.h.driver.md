# Purpose
This C header file, `fd_pack_tile_seccomp.h`, is a generated file that defines a seccomp (secure computing mode) filter policy using Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF) instructions. The primary purpose of this file is to provide a security mechanism that restricts the system calls a process can make, thereby reducing the risk of exploitation. The file includes necessary headers for seccomp and BPF operations and defines architecture-specific constants to ensure compatibility with different CPU architectures such as i386, x86_64, and aarch64. The core functionality is encapsulated in the [`populate_sock_filter_policy_fd_pack_tile`](#populate_sock_filter_policy_fd_pack_tile) function, which initializes a BPF filter array with specific rules to allow or deny system calls based on their numbers and arguments.

The filter policy defined in this file is relatively narrow in scope, focusing on allowing only specific system calls (`write` and `fsync`) under certain conditions, while all other calls result in the process being killed. This is achieved through a series of BPF statements and jumps that check the architecture, load syscall numbers, and evaluate syscall arguments. The file is intended to be included in other C source files where this seccomp policy is needed, providing a predefined security layer that can be applied to processes to enforce strict syscall filtering. The use of macros and conditional compilation ensures that the filter is tailored to the architecture it is compiled on, enhancing its portability and effectiveness.

# Global Variables

---
### sock\_filter\_policy\_fd\_pack\_tile\_instr\_cnt
- **Type**: `unsigned int`
- **Description**: The variable `sock_filter_policy_fd_pack_tile_instr_cnt` is a constant unsigned integer that holds the value 14. This value represents the number of instructions in a Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF) program used for a seccomp filter policy.
- **Use**: This variable is used to ensure that the output buffer for the seccomp filter policy has enough space to accommodate all 14 instructions.


# Functions

---
### populate\_sock\_filter\_policy\_fd\_pack\_tile<!-- {{#callable:populate_sock_filter_policy_fd_pack_tile}} -->
The function `populate_sock_filter_policy_fd_pack_tile` initializes a seccomp filter to restrict system calls based on architecture and specific syscall numbers, copying the filter to a provided output buffer.
- **Inputs**:
    - `out_cnt`: The number of elements in the output buffer, which must be at least 14.
    - `out`: A pointer to a buffer where the seccomp filter will be copied.
    - `logfile_fd`: The file descriptor to be allowed for certain syscalls, specifically `write` and `fsync`.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if `out_cnt` is at least 14 using `FD_TEST` macro.
    - Define a seccomp filter array `filter` with 14 `sock_filter` instructions.
    - The first instruction loads the architecture from `seccomp_data` and checks if it matches the expected architecture `ARCH_NR`; if not, it jumps to `RET_KILL_PROCESS`.
    - Load the syscall number and check if it is `SYS_write` or `SYS_fsync`; if not, jump to `RET_KILL_PROCESS`.
    - For `SYS_write`, check if the first argument is 2 or `logfile_fd`; if not, jump to `RET_KILL_PROCESS`.
    - For `SYS_fsync`, check if the first argument is `logfile_fd`; if not, jump to `RET_KILL_PROCESS`.
    - If any check fails, the process is killed (`RET_KILL_PROCESS`), otherwise it is allowed (`RET_ALLOW`).
    - Copy the filter array to the output buffer `out` using `fd_memcpy`.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it populates the provided buffer `out` with the seccomp filter instructions.
