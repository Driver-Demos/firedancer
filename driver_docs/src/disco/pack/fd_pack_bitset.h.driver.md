# Purpose
This C header file, `fd_pack_bitset.h`, is designed to manage a hybrid bitset/hashset representation for efficiently determining transaction conflicts in a system where transactions reference accounts. The primary purpose of this file is to provide a mechanism for set intersection, which is crucial for identifying conflicts between transactions. The file leverages the observation that account references in transactions follow a power-law distribution, meaning some accounts are referenced more frequently than others. This characteristic is exploited by reserving bits for accounts that appear in multiple transactions, thus optimizing the conflict detection process. The file defines macros and functions for managing bitsets, including operations like setting, clearing, and checking bits, as well as performing set unions and intersections.

The file is structured to support different levels of SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) optimizations, specifically AVX and AVX-512, to enhance performance on compatible hardware. It defines a set of macros that abstract the underlying implementation details, allowing the same interface to be used regardless of the SIMD capabilities of the target system. This abstraction includes defining the type of the bitset, the maximum number of elements it can store, and various operations on the bitset. The file does not define a public API or external interface but rather provides internal utilities for managing bitsets within the context of the broader `fd_pack` system. The design choices, such as deferring the freeing of bits and handling overflow conditions, are made to balance complexity and performance, acknowledging that the representation may sometimes yield false negatives in conflict detection.
