# Purpose
The provided content is from a Makefile, which is used to automate the build process of a software project. This particular Makefile snippet is structured to conditionally include headers and compile object files based on the presence of certain features, such as `FD_HAS_DOUBLE`, `FD_HAS_SSE`, and `FD_HAS_HOSTED`. It defines rules for adding headers and object files, and specifies unit tests to be created and executed for various components like `test_compute_budget_program`, `test_est_tbl`, and others. Additionally, it includes a fuzz test for `fuzz_compute_budget_program_parse` if the `FD_HAS_HOSTED` feature is enabled. The use of `$(call ...)` indicates the use of custom functions within the Makefile to streamline repetitive tasks, enhancing maintainability and readability.
