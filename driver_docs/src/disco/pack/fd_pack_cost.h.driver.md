# Purpose
This C header file defines a transaction cost model for a blockchain consensus mechanism, focusing on calculating the costs associated with executing transactions. The file outlines various components of the cost model, including per-signature costs, write-lock costs, instruction data length costs, built-in execution costs, BPF execution costs, and loaded accounts data costs. These components are summed to determine the total transaction cost, with special handling for simple vote transactions that incur a fixed cost. The file also includes a perfect hash table implementation to efficiently compute the built-in execution costs based on predefined program IDs.

The file provides a detailed implementation of the [`fd_pack_compute_cost`](#fd_pack_compute_cost) function, which calculates the total cost of a transaction by considering various factors such as the number of signatures, writable accounts, instruction data size, and execution costs. It also includes constants and macros to define cost values and manage the perfect hash table. The header file is intended to be included in other C source files, providing a public API for computing transaction costs in a blockchain system. The code is structured to ensure performance and accuracy in cost computation, with considerations for overflow and efficient data handling.

# Global Variables

---
### FD\_PACK\_SIMPLE\_VOTE\_COST
- **Type**: `ulong`
- **Description**: `FD_PACK_SIMPLE_VOTE_COST` is a constant unsigned long integer that represents the fixed cost associated with executing a simple vote transaction in the system. This cost is calculated by summing the cost per signature, twice the cost per writable account, a default compute unit cost for votes, and an additional fixed instruction data cost.
- **Use**: This variable is used to determine the total cost of processing a simple vote transaction, ensuring it is accounted for in the transaction cost model.


# Data Structures

---
### fd\_pack\_builtin\_prog\_cost
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `program_id`: An array of 32 unsigned characters representing the unique identifier of a program.
    - `cost_per_instr`: An unsigned long integer representing the cost per instruction for the program.
- **Description**: The `fd_pack_builtin_prog_cost` structure is designed to store information about the cost associated with executing built-in programs in a transaction cost model. It contains a 32-byte program identifier and a cost per instruction, which is used to calculate the total cost of executing instructions for a given program. This structure is aligned to 32 bytes for performance optimization and is part of a larger system that estimates transaction costs based on various factors, including built-in execution costs.

### fd\_pack\_builtin\_prog\_cost\_t
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `program_id`: An array of 32 unsigned characters representing the unique identifier for a program.
    - `cost_per_instr`: An unsigned long integer representing the cost per instruction for the program.
- **Description**: The `fd_pack_builtin_prog_cost_t` structure is designed to represent the cost model for built-in programs within a transaction cost model. It contains a `program_id` to uniquely identify a program and a `cost_per_instr` to specify the fixed cost associated with executing instructions of that program. This structure is aligned to 32 bytes for performance reasons and is used in a perfect hash table to quickly determine the cost of executing built-in programs as part of a transaction's total cost calculation.


# Functions

---
### fd\_pack\_compute\_cost<!-- {{#callable:fd_pack_compute_cost}} -->
The `fd_pack_compute_cost` function calculates the total cost of a transaction, including execution, signature, and data costs, and updates related properties based on the transaction's characteristics.
- **Inputs**:
    - `txn`: A pointer to an `fd_txn_t` structure representing the transaction whose cost is to be computed.
    - `payload`: A pointer to an array of unsigned characters representing the transaction payload data.
    - `flags`: A pointer to a `uint` where transaction flags are stored and updated, particularly to indicate if the transaction is a simple vote.
    - `opt_execution_cost`: An optional pointer to a `ulong` where the execution cost will be stored if provided.
    - `opt_fee`: An optional pointer to a `ulong` where the priority fee will be stored if provided.
    - `opt_precompile_sig_cnt`: An optional pointer to a `ulong` where the count of precompile signatures will be stored if provided.
    - `opt_loaded_accounts_data_cost`: An optional pointer to a `ulong` where the loaded accounts data cost will be stored if provided.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if the transaction is a simple vote; if so, set the simple vote flag, update optional outputs, and return a fixed cost.
    - Clear the simple vote flag if the transaction is not a simple vote.
    - Calculate the signature cost based on the number of signer accounts.
    - Calculate the writable account cost based on the number of writable accounts.
    - Initialize variables for instruction data size, built-in cost, non-built-in instruction count, and precompile signature count.
    - Iterate over each instruction in the transaction to accumulate data size, built-in costs, and precompile signature counts.
    - For each instruction, determine if it matches specific program IDs and adjust costs accordingly.
    - Calculate the instruction data cost based on the accumulated data size.
    - Finalize the compute budget program state to determine the fee, compute units, and loaded account data cost.
    - Calculate the execution cost based on the compute budget program state and non-built-in instruction count.
    - Store the calculated costs in the optional output pointers if they are provided.
    - Return the total transaction cost, which is the sum of signature, writable, execution, instruction data, and loaded account data costs.
- **Output**: The function returns a `ulong` representing the total cost of the transaction, or 0 if the transaction is invalid or a simple vote transaction is detected.
