# Purpose
This C header file defines a perfect hash table for managing a set of special addresses that are not permitted to be written to within a transaction processing system. The primary purpose of this file is to ensure that any transaction attempting to write to these predefined addresses is immediately rejected, thereby maintaining the integrity and security of the system. The file specifies a list of system variables and program identifiers that are considered unwritable, and it uses a perfect hash function to efficiently map these addresses for quick lookup. The perfect hash function is tailored to fit the specific set of addresses, ensuring optimal performance.

The technical components of this file include several macro definitions that configure the perfect hash table, such as the table size, hash constants, and key comparison logic. The file also includes a list of system variables and program identifiers that are marked as unwritable, which are critical to the system's operation. By including the `fd_map_perfect.c` template, the file leverages a generic implementation of a perfect hash map, customized for the specific use case of managing unwritable addresses. This header file is intended to be included in other parts of the system where transaction validation is performed, ensuring that the unwritable addresses are consistently enforced across the application.
