## Folders
- **[generated](cswtch/generated.driver.md)**: The `generated` folder in the `firedancer` codebase contains a file, `fd_cswtch_tile_seccomp.h`, which defines a seccomp filter policy for syscall handling, generated by a script to enforce security constraints on specific system calls.

## Files
- **[fd_cswtch_tile.c](cswtch/fd_cswtch_tile.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_cswtch_tile.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase implements context switching metrics collection and management for tiles, including initialization, reporting, and handling of process status and file descriptors.
- **[fd_cswtch_tile.seccomppolicy](cswtch/fd_cswtch_tile.seccomppolicy.driver.md)**: The `fd_cswtch_tile.seccomppolicy` file in the `firedancer` codebase defines security policies for logging, file synchronization, context switch metrics retrieval, and CPU usage reduction through sleep operations.
- **[Local.mk](cswtch/Local.mk.driver.md)**: The `Local.mk` file in the `firedancer` codebase conditionally adds objects to the build process for `fd_cswtch_tile` and `fd_disco` if `FD_HAS_SSE` is defined.
