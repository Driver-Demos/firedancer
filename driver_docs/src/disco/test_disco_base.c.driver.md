# Purpose
This C source code file is a simple test stub designed to initialize and finalize a random number generator (RNG) environment using the functions provided by the "fd_disco" library. The [`main`](#main) function begins by calling `fd_boot` to set up the environment, then creates and joins a new RNG instance with `fd_rng_new` and `fd_rng_join`. Although the RNG is initialized, the code does not perform any operations with it, as indicated by the comment suggesting future tests. The RNG is then properly cleaned up with `fd_rng_leave` and `fd_rng_delete`, ensuring no resource leaks. Finally, the program logs a "pass" message and calls `fd_halt` before exiting, indicating successful execution.

# Functions

---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function initializes the environment, sets up a random number generator, and logs a notice before halting the program.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The count of command-line arguments passed to the program.
    - `argv`: An array of strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function begins by calling `fd_boot` to initialize the environment with the command-line arguments.
    - A random number generator is created and joined using `fd_rng_new` and `fd_rng_join`.
    - The function contains a comment indicating it is a stub for future tests, implying no significant operations are currently performed.
    - The random number generator is deleted and left using `fd_rng_leave` and `fd_rng_delete`.
    - A log notice is generated with the message 'pass' using `FD_LOG_NOTICE`.
    - The function calls `fd_halt` to perform any necessary cleanup and halt the program.
    - The function returns 0, indicating successful execution.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer value of 0, indicating successful execution.
