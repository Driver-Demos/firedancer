# Purpose
The provided file contents appear to be a configuration or policy script that defines rules for logging and metrics collection within a software system. It specifies how log messages are handled, indicating that all messages are written to a log file, while messages of 'WARNING' level and above are also directed to STDERR. The configuration ensures that the log file is immediately synchronized to disk for critical messages. Additionally, it outlines how metrics related to context switches are gathered by reading from specific file descriptors associated with the `/proc/status` files, excluding those used for logging and STDOUT. The script also includes a rule to reduce CPU usage by allowing the system to sleep under certain conditions, specifically when using the `clock_nanosleep` function with the `CLOCK_REALTIME` clock.
