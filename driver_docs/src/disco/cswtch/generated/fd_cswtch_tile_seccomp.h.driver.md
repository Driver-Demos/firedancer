# Purpose
This C header file, `fd_cswtch_tile_seccomp.h`, is a generated file that defines a seccomp (secure computing mode) filter policy using the Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF) mechanism. The primary purpose of this file is to provide a predefined set of rules that restrict the system calls a process can make, enhancing security by limiting the attack surface. The file includes necessary headers for working with seccomp and BPF, and it defines architecture-specific constants to ensure compatibility with the runtime environment. The seccomp filter is implemented as an array of `struct sock_filter` instructions, which are used to evaluate system calls and determine whether they should be allowed or result in the termination of the process.

The function [`populate_sock_filter_policy_fd_cswtch_tile`](#populate_sock_filter_policy_fd_cswtch_tile) is the core component of this file, responsible for populating an array with the seccomp filter instructions. The filter checks the architecture of the executing process and allows or denies specific system calls such as `write`, `fsync`, `lseek`, `read`, and `clock_nanosleep` based on predefined conditions. If a system call does not match any of the allowed patterns, the process is terminated using `SECCOMP_RET_KILL_PROCESS`. This file is intended to be included in other C source files where seccomp filtering is required, providing a consistent and automated way to enforce security policies across different architectures.

# Global Variables

---
### sock\_filter\_policy\_fd\_cswtch\_tile\_instr\_cnt
- **Type**: `unsigned int`
- **Description**: The variable `sock_filter_policy_fd_cswtch_tile_instr_cnt` is a static constant of type `unsigned int` with a value of 35. It represents the number of instructions in a socket filter policy used for context switching in a seccomp (secure computing mode) environment.
- **Use**: This variable is used to ensure that the output buffer in the `populate_sock_filter_policy_fd_cswtch_tile` function has enough space to hold the 35 instructions of the filter policy.


# Functions

---
### populate\_sock\_filter\_policy\_fd\_cswtch\_tile<!-- {{#callable:populate_sock_filter_policy_fd_cswtch_tile}} -->
The function `populate_sock_filter_policy_fd_cswtch_tile` initializes a seccomp BPF filter to enforce syscall policies based on architecture and specific syscall conditions.
- **Inputs**:
    - `out_cnt`: The number of elements in the output filter array, which must be at least 35.
    - `out`: A pointer to an array of `struct sock_filter` where the filter rules will be copied.
    - `logfile_fd`: The file descriptor used in the filter rules to allow or deny certain syscalls based on this value.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function begins by asserting that `out_cnt` is at least 35 using `FD_TEST` to ensure the output array can hold the filter rules.
    - A static array `filter` of 35 `struct sock_filter` elements is defined to hold the BPF instructions.
    - The filter first checks if the architecture of the running process matches the expected architecture (`ARCH_NR`); if not, it jumps to `RET_KILL_PROCESS`.
    - The syscall number is loaded, and the filter checks for specific syscalls (`write`, `fsync`, `lseek`, `read`, `clock_nanosleep`) and jumps to corresponding labels for further checks.
    - For each syscall, the filter loads syscall arguments and compares them against expected values (e.g., `logfile_fd`, `SEEK_SET`, `CLOCK_REALTIME`) to decide whether to allow or kill the process.
    - If none of the conditions match, the filter defaults to `RET_KILL_PROCESS`.
    - Finally, the filter rules are copied to the output array `out` using `fd_memcpy`.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it populates the `out` array with the BPF filter rules.
