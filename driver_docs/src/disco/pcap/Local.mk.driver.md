# Purpose
This file is a Makefile snippet used for building a software project. It defines build rules by invoking macros to add header files, object files, unit tests, and binary targets related to the `fd_pcap_replay` component and its dependencies, such as `fd_disco`, `fd_flamenco`, `fd_tango`, and `fd_util`.
