# Purpose
This C source code file is designed to perform a unit test for a packet capture (PCAP) replay system, which is part of a larger software framework. The code is structured to execute both transmission (TX) and reception (RX) operations in a simulated environment, utilizing a configuration structure (`test_cfg_t`) to manage various parameters such as workspace, command-and-control (CNC) structures, and random number generation seeds. The file includes static assertions to ensure that certain constants are correctly defined, which is crucial for maintaining consistency and correctness in the replay operations.

The main technical components of the code include the setup and execution of TX and RX tiles, which are responsible for handling the transmission and reception of data packets, respectively. The TX tile reads from a PCAP file and sends packets, while the RX tile receives these packets and performs necessary housekeeping tasks such as flow control and diagnostics. The code also manages shared memory resources, including workspaces, caches, and CNC structures, to facilitate communication and synchronization between the TX and RX operations. The main function orchestrates the initialization, execution, and cleanup of these components, ensuring that the test runs for a specified duration and collects diagnostic information for monitoring purposes. The file is intended to be compiled and executed in an environment with hosted capabilities, as indicated by the conditional compilation directive `#if FD_HAS_HOSTED`.

# Functions

---
### tx\_tile\_main<!-- {{#callable:tx_tile_main}} -->
The `tx_tile_main` function initializes a random number generator and a scratch buffer, then executes a packet replay operation using configuration parameters, and finally cleans up resources before returning.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments passed to the function, which is not used in this function.
    - `argv`: An array of command-line arguments, which is cast to a `test_cfg_t` structure containing configuration parameters for the function.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function casts the `argv` parameter to a `test_cfg_t` pointer to access configuration settings.
    - A random number generator (`fd_rng_t`) is initialized using the seed from the configuration (`cfg->tx_seed`).
    - A scratch buffer is allocated with a size and alignment defined by `FD_PCAP_REPLAY_TILE_SCRATCH_FOOTPRINT` and `FD_PCAP_REPLAY_TILE_SCRATCH_ALIGN`.
    - The function calls `fd_pcap_replay_tile` with various configuration parameters to perform a packet replay operation.
    - The function checks the result of `fd_pcap_replay_tile` using `FD_TEST` to ensure it completes successfully.
    - The random number generator is cleaned up by calling `fd_rng_delete` after leaving it with `fd_rng_leave`.

    - Wait for the next fragment sequence while performing housekeeping tasks if needed.
    - If housekeeping is due, send flow control credits, update diagnostics, check for command signals, and reload the housekeeping timer.
    - If a sequence overrun is detected, log an error and exit the loop.
    - Process the received data fragment, checking for overruns during processing.
    - Increment the sequence number for the next iteration.
