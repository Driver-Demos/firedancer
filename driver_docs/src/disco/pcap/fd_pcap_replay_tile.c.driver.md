# Purpose
This C source code file is designed to execute a program that replays packet capture (PCAP) data using a specified configuration. The program is structured to run in a hosted environment, as indicated by the `#if FD_HAS_HOSTED` preprocessor directive. The main function initializes the environment, processes command-line arguments to configure various parameters such as CNC (Command and Control), PCAP file, maximum packet size, memory caches, and output sequence files. It then joins shared memory resources and sets up a random number generator for use during execution. The core functionality is provided by the `fd_pcap_replay_tile` function, which handles the actual replay of the PCAP data using the specified configurations and resources.

The code is a standalone executable, as evidenced by the presence of a [`main`](#main) function, and it does not define any public APIs or external interfaces. It focuses on setting up the environment and resources necessary for replaying PCAP data, including memory allocation and resource management. The program logs its progress and errors using a logging mechanism, ensuring that any issues during execution are reported. The file concludes by releasing allocated resources and halting the environment, ensuring a clean shutdown. The code also includes a fallback [`main`](#main) function for non-hosted environments, which currently only logs a warning and exits, indicating that support for such environments is not yet implemented.

# Functions

---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function initializes the environment, logs a warning about unsupported build targets, and halts the program, returning an error code.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The count of command-line arguments passed to the program.
    - `argv`: An array of strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Call `fd_boot` to initialize the environment with command-line arguments.
    - Log a warning message indicating that support for the current build target is not implemented.
    - Call `fd_halt` to terminate the program.
    - Return an error code of 1.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer value of 1, indicating an error or unsupported operation.
