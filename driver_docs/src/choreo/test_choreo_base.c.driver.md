# Purpose
This C source code file is a minimal program that serves as a basic template for initializing and terminating a system or application using the functions `fd_boot` and `fd_halt`, which are likely defined in the included header file "fd_choreo.h". The [`main`](#main) function takes command-line arguments, which are passed by reference to `fd_boot`, suggesting that this function might perform some initialization tasks that require or modify these arguments. After initialization, the program immediately calls `fd_halt`, which likely performs cleanup or shutdown operations, before returning 0 to indicate successful execution. This structure is typical for applications that require specific setup and teardown procedures.
# Imports and Dependencies

- `fd_choreo.h`


# Functions

---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function initializes the program using `fd_boot` and then terminates it with `fd_halt`, returning 0 to indicate successful execution.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: An integer representing the number of command-line arguments passed to the program.
    - `argv`: An array of character pointers listing all the arguments passed to the program.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function begins by calling `fd_boot`, passing the addresses of `argc` and `argv` to initialize the program environment.
    - After initialization, the function calls `fd_halt` to perform any necessary cleanup or termination procedures.
    - Finally, the function returns 0, indicating that the program has executed successfully.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer value of 0, which is a standard convention to indicate successful execution of a program.
