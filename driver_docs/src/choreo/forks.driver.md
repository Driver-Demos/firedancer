## Files
- **[fd_forks.c](forks/fd_forks.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_forks.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase provides functions for managing and manipulating fork structures, including creation, joining, querying, updating, and publishing forks within a shared memory context.
- **[fd_forks.h](forks/fd_forks.h.driver.md)**: The `fd_forks.h` file in the `firedancer` codebase defines the structures and functions for managing and manipulating fork heads within a blockchain frontier, including operations for initialization, querying, advancing, preparing, updating, publishing, and printing fork information.
- **[Local.mk](forks/Local.mk.driver.md)**: The `Local.mk` file in the `firedancer` codebase defines build instructions for headers, objects, and unit tests related to `fd_forks` and other components, conditional on the presence of `FD_HAS_INT128`.
- **[test_forks.c](forks/test_forks.c.driver.md)**: The `test_forks.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase contains a simple program that initializes and halts the `fd_forks` system.
