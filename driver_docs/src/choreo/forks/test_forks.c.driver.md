# Purpose
This is a simple C program that serves as a basic template for initializing and finalizing a process using the functions `fd_boot` and `fd_halt`, which are likely defined in the included header file "fd_forks.h". The `fd_boot` function is called at the start of the [`main`](#main) function to perform any necessary setup or initialization, potentially modifying the command-line arguments `argc` and `argv`. After the initialization, the program immediately calls `fd_halt`, which likely performs cleanup or shutdown operations before the program exits. This structure suggests that the program is designed to be a minimal framework for applications that require specific startup and shutdown procedures, possibly in a larger system or library context.
# Imports and Dependencies

# Functions

---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function initializes the program using `fd_boot` and then terminates it using `fd_halt`.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: An integer representing the number of command-line arguments passed to the program.
    - `argv`: An array of character pointers listing all the arguments passed to the program.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function `fd_boot` is called with pointers to `argc` and `argv` to perform any necessary initialization.
    - The function `fd_halt` is called to perform any necessary cleanup or termination procedures.
    - The function returns 0, indicating successful execution.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer value of 0, indicating successful completion of the program.
