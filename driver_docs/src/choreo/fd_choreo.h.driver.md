# Purpose
This code is a C header file that serves as an inclusion guard and a central point for including multiple other header files related to a project or module named "choreo." The inclusion guard, defined by `#ifndef`, `#define`, and `#endif`, prevents multiple inclusions of this header file, which could lead to compilation errors. The file includes several other headers, such as `fd_choreo_base.h`, `fd_epoch.h`, `fd_eqvoc.h`, `fd_forks.h`, `fd_ghost.h`, `fd_tower.h`, and `fd_voter.h`, suggesting that it aggregates various components or functionalities related to the "choreo" module. This setup is typical in modular C projects to manage dependencies and organize code efficiently.
