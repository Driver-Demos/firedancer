- **[fd_epoch.c](epoch/fd_epoch.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_epoch.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase provides functions for managing epochs, including creating, joining, leaving, deleting, initializing, and finalizing epoch structures with shared memory and voter management.
- **[fd_epoch.h](epoch/fd_epoch.h.driver.md)**: The `fd_epoch.h` file in the `firedancer` codebase defines the structure and functions for managing epochs, including initialization, joining, leaving, and deleting epochs, as well as handling voter data within an epoch.
- **[Local.mk](epoch/Local.mk.driver.md)**: The `Local.mk` file in the `firedancer` codebase specifies conditional inclusion of headers and objects related to `fd_epoch` and `fd_choreo` based on the presence of 128-bit integer support.
