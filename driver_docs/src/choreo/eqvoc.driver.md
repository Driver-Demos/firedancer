## Files
- **[fd_eqvoc.c](eqvoc/fd_eqvoc.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_eqvoc.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase implements functions for managing and verifying Forward Error Correction (FEC) and proof data structures, including creation, joining, insertion, and verification of shreds and proofs.
- **[fd_eqvoc.h](eqvoc/fd_eqvoc.h.driver.md)**: The `fd_eqvoc.h` file in the `firedancer` codebase provides an API for detecting and handling proofs of equivocation, including constructing, verifying, and managing equivocation proofs from shreds, as well as managing FEC set metadata to detect conflicting shreds.
- **[Local.mk](eqvoc/Local.mk.driver.md)**: The `Local.mk` file in the `firedancer` codebase specifies build instructions for the `fd_eqvoc` component, including header and object files, and conditional unit test setup based on the presence of `FD_HAS_INT128` and `FD_HAS_HOSTED`.
- **[test_eqvoc.c](eqvoc/test_eqvoc.c.driver.md)**: The `test_eqvoc.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase is a specialized C test suite designed to verify the integrity and authenticity of data shreds using cryptographic proof mechanisms, focusing on testing equivocation scenarios in distributed or blockchain-based environments through functions like `test_eqvoc_proof_verify`, `test_eqvoc_proof_from_chunks`, and `test_eqvoc_proof_to_chunks`, and is structured around a series of test cases to ensure the correctness of the `fd_eqvoc_shreds_verify` function.
