# Purpose
The provided C code defines a function [`fd_voter_state`](#fd_voter_state) that is part of a larger system, likely dealing with some form of record or transaction management, as suggested by the inclusion of headers like "fd_funk.h" and "fd_funk_val.h". This function is designed to retrieve the state of a voter from a given record, using a query mechanism to interact with a database or data structure represented by `fd_funk_t`. The function performs a series of checks to ensure the integrity and validity of the data it processes, such as verifying the presence and correctness of metadata and state information. It uses a loop to repeatedly attempt to query and validate the record until a valid state is found or it determines that the record is not suitable for use.

The function is part of a broader library or module, as indicated by its reliance on external components like `fd_funk_rec_query_try_global` and `fd_funk_val_const`. It does not define a public API or external interface directly but rather serves as an internal utility function that other parts of the system might call to obtain voter state information. The function's robust error-checking and logging mechanisms suggest it is designed for use in a critical system where data integrity is paramount. The use of macros like `FD_UNLIKELY` and `FD_LIKELY` indicates an emphasis on performance optimization, likely to guide branch prediction in the compiled code.

# Functions

### fd\_voter\_state<!-- {{#callable:fd_voter_state}} -->
The `fd_voter_state` function retrieves the voter state from a record in a database, ensuring the record and its metadata are valid before returning the state.
- **Inputs**:
    - `funk`: A pointer to an `fd_funk_t` structure, representing the database context.
    - `query`: A pointer to an `fd_funk_rec_query_t` structure, used to query the database.
    - `txn`: A pointer to a constant `fd_funk_txn_t` structure, representing the transaction context.
    - `key`: A pointer to a constant `fd_funk_rec_key_t` structure, representing the key of the record to query.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Enter an infinite loop to repeatedly attempt to retrieve and validate the record.
    - Call `fd_funk_rec_query_try_global` to attempt to retrieve the record associated with the given key and transaction.
    - If the record is not found or is marked for erasure, return `NULL`.
    - Retrieve the account metadata using `fd_funk_val_const` and check its validity by comparing its magic number.
    - If the metadata is invalid, log a warning and continue to the next iteration of the loop.
    - Calculate the voter state pointer by offsetting from the metadata and validate its discriminant value.
    - If the voter state is invalid, log a warning and continue to the next iteration of the loop.
    - If the query test passes, return the valid voter state.
- **Output**: A pointer to a constant `fd_voter_state_t` structure representing the voter state, or `NULL` if the record is invalid or not found.
