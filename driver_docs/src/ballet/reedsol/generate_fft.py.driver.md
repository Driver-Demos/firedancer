# Purpose
This Python script is designed to generate C header and source files that implement a specialized Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and its inverse (IFFT) for use with Reed-Solomon erasure codes. The script leverages the Galois field arithmetic provided by the `galois` library and uses `numpy` for numerical operations. The primary purpose of the generated C code is to transform polynomials between two bases: the "evaluation basis" and the "coefficient basis," as described in a referenced IEEE paper. The script defines macros and functions for these transformations, which are optimized for specific sizes (powers of 2) and shifts, and are intended to be used in high-performance computing environments where Reed-Solomon codes are applied for error correction.

The script generates macros for FFT and IFFT operations, which are parameterized by the size of the transform and a shift value. These macros are used to insert code that performs the basis transformations, leveraging precomputed constants for efficiency. The script also generates C source files that define functions for these operations, allowing them to be compiled separately to improve build times. The generated code is highly specialized, focusing on vectorized operations in the Galois field GF(2^8), which is typical for applications in digital communications and data storage systems where Reed-Solomon codes are prevalent. The script's output is a set of C files that can be integrated into larger systems requiring robust error correction capabilities.

# Global Variables

### header
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: The `header` variable is a multi-line string that contains the content of a C header file. This header file is auto-generated and defines macros and function declarations for implementing a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-like operator for Reed-Solomon erasure codes, as described in a specific IEEE paper.
- **Use**: This variable is used to store the content of a C header file that is written to a file named 'fd_reedsol_fft.h'.


---
### outf
- **Type**: `file object`
- **Description**: The variable `outf` is a file object that is opened for writing text to a file named 'fd_reedsol_fft.h'. This file is intended to store auto-generated C header content related to FFT-like operations for Reed-Solomon erasure codes.
- **Use**: This variable is used to write the header content and macro definitions to the specified file.


---
### GF
- **Type**: `galois.GF`
- **Description**: The variable `GF` is an instance of a Galois Field of order 2^8, created using the `galois` library. Galois Fields are mathematical structures used in coding theory and cryptography, particularly for error correction and detection.
- **Use**: This variable is used to perform arithmetic operations within the Galois Field GF(2^8), which is essential for the implementation of the FFT-like operator for Reed-Solomon erasure codes.


---
### svals
- **Type**: `dictionary`
- **Description**: The `svals` variable is a dictionary that stores precomputed values of polynomials s_j(x) for j ranging from 0 to 7 and x ranging from 0 to 255. These values are computed using operations in the Galois Field GF(2^8).
- **Use**: This variable is used to store intermediate polynomial values that are later used to compute normalized polynomials and other transformations in the FFT and IFFT operations.


---
### sbar
- **Type**: `dict`
- **Description**: The `sbar` variable is a dictionary that stores normalized polynomial values used in the FFT-like operator for Reed-Solomon erasure codes. It is indexed by tuples of integers `(j, x)`, where `j` is the index of the polynomial and `x` is the value at which the polynomial is evaluated. The values are computed as the division of `svals[j, x]` by `svals[j, 1<<j]`, where the operations are performed in the Galois Field GF(2^8).
- **Use**: The `sbar` dictionary is used to store precomputed normalized polynomial values for efficient computation of FFT and IFFT operations in the context of Reed-Solomon erasure codes.


# Functions

---
### reverse\_bits<!-- {{#callable:firedancer/src/ballet/reedsol/generate_fft.reverse_bits}} -->
The `reverse_bits` function reverses the order of bits in an integer `i` up to a specified length `l`.
- **Inputs**:
    - `i`: The integer whose bits are to be reversed.
    - `l`: The number of bits to consider for reversal.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize an output variable `out` to 0.
    - Iterate over each bit position `z` from 0 to `l-1`.
    - Check if the `z`-th bit of `i` is set (i.e., `i & (1<<z)` is true).
    - If the `z`-th bit is set, set the corresponding bit in `out` at position `l-1-z`.
    - Return the value of `out` after processing all bits.

- **Inputs**:
    - `macro_name`: The name of the macro to be defined.
    - `args`: A list of argument names for the macro.
    - `lines`: A list of strings representing the lines of code to be included in the macro body.
    - `indent`: An optional integer specifying the number of spaces to use for indentation, defaulting to 2.
