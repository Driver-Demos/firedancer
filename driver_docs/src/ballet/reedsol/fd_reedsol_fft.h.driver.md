# Purpose
The provided code is a C header file implementing specialized Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT) operations tailored for Reed-Solomon error correction codes, utilizing a novel polynomial basis as described in an IEEE paper. It is designed to transform polynomials between the "evaluation basis" and the "coefficient basis" within the Galois Field GF(2^8), which is essential for error correction in data storage and transmission systems. The code comprises macros and function declarations, such as `FD_REEDSOL_GENERATE_FFT` and `FD_REEDSOL_GENERATE_IFFT`, which facilitate FFT and IFFT operations on data sets of varying sizes, optimized through vectorization and "butterfly" operations. These components are intended for internal use within a larger library, providing foundational functionality for error correction without defining a public API, and are likely auto-generated to allow dynamic code creation based on specific configurations. This structure supports high-performance computing applications by offering reusable, low-level building blocks for robust error correction capabilities.

### fd\_reedsol\_ifft\_256\_0<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_reedsol_ifft_256_0}} -->
Performs an inverse fast Fourier transform on 256 Galois field elements.
- **Description**: This function is used to perform an inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) on 256 elements of a Galois field, which are provided as input pointers. It is typically used in error correction algorithms, such as Reed-Solomon codes, where transforming data between time and frequency domains is necessary. The function expects exactly 256 input pointers, each pointing to a valid `gf_t` element. The input values are modified in place, meaning the results of the IFFT are written back to the same memory locations. Ensure that all input pointers are valid and non-null before calling this function to avoid undefined behavior.

### fd\_reedsol\_fft\_256\_0<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_reedsol_fft_256_0}} -->
Performs a 256-point Reed-Solomon FFT transformation on input data.
- **Description**: This function applies a 256-point Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) specific to Reed-Solomon error correction codes on the provided input data. It is designed to be used in contexts where Reed-Solomon encoding or decoding is required, particularly in error correction scenarios. The function expects 256 input elements, each represented by a pointer to a `gf_t` type, which is typically a Galois Field element. The function modifies the input data in place, so the input pointers must point to valid, writable memory locations. It is crucial to ensure that all input pointers are non-null and correctly initialized before calling this function to avoid undefined behavior.

### fd\_reedsol\_ifft\_128\_0<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_reedsol_ifft_128_0}} -->
Performs an inverse fast Fourier transform on 128 Galois field elements.
- **Description**: This function is used to perform an inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) on 128 input elements represented in a Galois field. It is typically used in error correction algorithms such as Reed-Solomon codes. The function takes pointers to 128 `gf_t` elements as input, modifies them in place, and does not return any value. It is essential that all input pointers are valid and point to initialized `gf_t` elements, as the function will dereference these pointers to read and write data. The caller must ensure that the input pointers are not null and that they point to memory locations that can be safely modified.

### fd\_reedsol\_ifft\_128\_128<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_reedsol_ifft_128_128}} -->
Performs an inverse fast Fourier transform on 128 input elements.
- **Description**: This function applies an inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) to 128 input elements, each represented by a pointer to a `gf_t` type. It is typically used in signal processing or error correction contexts where such transformations are necessary. The function expects all input pointers to be valid and non-null, as it reads from and writes back to these locations. The caller must ensure that the input data is correctly initialized before calling this function. After execution, the transformed data is written back to the original input locations.

### fd\_reedsol\_fft\_128\_0<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_reedsol_fft_128_0}} -->
Performs a 128-point Reed-Solomon FFT transformation on input data.
- **Description**: This function applies a 128-point Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) specific to Reed-Solomon error correction on the provided input data. It is designed to be used in contexts where Reed-Solomon encoding or decoding is required, particularly in error correction scenarios. The function expects exactly 128 input elements, each represented by a pointer to a `gf_t` type, which is typically a Galois Field element. The function modifies the input data in place, meaning the transformed data will overwrite the original input values. It is crucial that all input pointers are valid and point to properly initialized `gf_t` elements, as the function does not perform any input validation or error checking.

### fd\_reedsol\_fft\_128\_128<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_reedsol_fft_128_128}} -->
Performs a 128-point Reed-Solomon FFT on input data.
- **Description**: This function applies a 128-point Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) specifically designed for Reed-Solomon error correction codes on the provided input data. It is intended for use in contexts where Reed-Solomon encoding or decoding is required. The function expects exactly 128 input elements, each represented as a pointer to a `gf_t` type, which is typically a Galois Field element. The function modifies the input data in place, so the input pointers must point to valid, writable memory locations. It is crucial to ensure that all input pointers are non-null and correctly initialized before calling this function to avoid undefined behavior.

### fd\_reedsol\_fft\_64\_64<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_reedsol_fft_64_64}} -->
Performs a 64-point Reed-Solomon FFT on the input data.
- **Description**: This function applies a 64-point Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) specifically designed for Reed-Solomon error correction on the provided input data. It is intended for use in scenarios where Reed-Solomon encoding or decoding is required. The function takes 64 input values, each represented by a pointer to a `gf_t` type, and performs in-place transformation, meaning the input data is directly modified to contain the transformed values. Users must ensure that all input pointers are valid and point to initialized `gf_t` values before calling this function. The function does not perform any input validation, so invalid pointers or uninitialized data may lead to undefined behavior.
- **Inputs**:

### fd\_reedsol\_fft\_64\_128<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_reedsol_fft_64_128}} -->
Performs a 64-point FFT on 128-element input data.
- **Description**: This function applies a 64-point Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to a set of 128 input elements, modifying the input data in place. It is typically used in signal processing applications where such transformations are required. The function expects exactly 64 input pointers, each pointing to a valid `gf_t` element. The input data is transformed and the results are written back to the same memory locations. Ensure that all input pointers are valid and non-null before calling this function to avoid undefined behavior.
