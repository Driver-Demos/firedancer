# Purpose
This Python script is designed to generate C header and source files that implement the Principal Pivot Transform (PPT) for Reed-Solomon Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) operations. The script is highly specialized and focuses on generating macros and functions that facilitate the computation of the PPT, which is a mathematical technique used to interpolate polynomials when the number of data shreds is not a power of two. The script leverages the Galois field arithmetic provided by the `galois` library and uses `numpy` for matrix operations. The generated C code is intended to be used in scenarios where efficient polynomial interpolation and parity computation are required, such as in error correction and data recovery applications.

The script defines several key functions, such as [`m_fft`](#m_fft), [`m_ifft`](#m_ifft), [`fft_matrix`](#fft_matrix), and [`ifft_matrix`](#ifft_matrix), which are used to construct FFT and inverse FFT matrices. These matrices are then used in the [`principal_pivot_transform_k_no_x`](#principal_pivot_transform_k_no_x) function to generate a sequence of operations that implement the PPT. The script outputs a C header file (`fd_reedsol_ppt.h`) containing macros for different configurations of the PPT, as well as multiple C source files that define functions for specific cases of the PPT. These files are auto-generated to ensure consistency and efficiency in the implementation of the PPT for various sizes and configurations, making the script a crucial tool for developers working with Reed-Solomon codes in performance-critical applications.

# Global Variables

---
### header
- **Type**: `str`
- **Description**: The `header` variable is a multi-line string that contains the content of a C header file. This file is auto-generated and includes definitions and macros for implementing the Principal Pivot Transform (PPT) for the Reed Solomon FFT operator. The header file provides a macro `FD_REEDSOL_GENERATE_PPT` for computing the PPT and includes detailed comments explaining the mathematical operations and constraints involved.
- **Use**: This variable is used to store the content of a C header file, which is then written to a file named 'fd_reedsol_ppt.h' for use in C programs.


---
### outf
- **Type**: `file object`
- **Description**: The variable `outf` is a file object that is opened for writing text to the file 'fd_reedsol_ppt.h'. This file is intended to store auto-generated C header content related to the Principal Pivot Transform for the Reed Solomon FFT operator.
- **Use**: This variable is used to write the `header` string content to the specified file, effectively creating or overwriting the file with the provided data.


---
### GF
- **Type**: `galois.GF`
- **Description**: The variable `GF` is an instance of a Galois Field created using the `galois` library, specifically representing the finite field GF(2^8). This field is commonly used in error correction codes and cryptography due to its properties and operations defined over 256 elements.
- **Use**: This variable is used to perform arithmetic operations within the finite field GF(2^8), which is essential for the implementation of algorithms like Reed-Solomon error correction.


---
### svals
- **Type**: `dict`
- **Description**: The `svals` variable is a dictionary that stores precomputed values used in the principal pivot transform for Reed-Solomon FFT operations. It is indexed by tuples of two integers, where the first integer represents a stage in the computation and the second integer represents an element index within that stage. The values stored are elements of a Galois Field (GF) of order 2^8, which are used in the computation of the FFT matrices.
- **Use**: This variable is used to store and retrieve precomputed Galois Field elements for efficient computation during the FFT and IFFT operations in the principal pivot transform.


---
### sbar
- **Type**: `dict`
- **Description**: The `sbar` variable is a dictionary that stores computed values based on the `svals` dictionary. It is populated within a nested loop where the outer loop iterates over a range of 7, and the inner loop iterates over a range of 128. For each combination of `j` and `x`, `sbar` stores the result of dividing `svals[j, x]` by `svals[j, 1<<j]`. This operation is performed for each `j` and `x` combination, effectively creating a lookup table of values.
- **Use**: The `sbar` dictionary is used in the `m_fft` and `m_ifft` functions to access precomputed values for matrix operations.


---
### batches
- **Type**: `tuple`
- **Description**: The `batches` variable is a tuple containing a sequence of integers: (17, 25, 33, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 68). These integers likely represent batch sizes or thresholds used in the program's logic.
- **Use**: This variable is used in a loop to iterate over pairs of consecutive batch sizes, facilitating operations between these batch thresholds.
