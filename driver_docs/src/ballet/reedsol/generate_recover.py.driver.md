# Purpose
This Python script is designed to generate C source files that implement functions for data recovery using Reed-Solomon error correction codes. The script defines a function [`make_recover_var`](#make_recover_var) that takes two parameters: `n`, which specifies the number of data elements, and `max_shreds`, which indicates the maximum number of shreds (or fragments) that can be processed. The script uses a helper function [`cprint`](#cprint) to manage indentation and formatting of the generated C code. The generated C functions are responsible for recovering data from a set of shreds, some of which may be missing or corrupted, by leveraging the mathematical properties of Reed-Solomon codes.

The script generates multiple C files, each corresponding to a different value of `n`, by calling [`make_recover_var`](#make_recover_var) with various parameters. The generated C code includes logic for loading data shreds, checking for missing data, and performing mathematical operations such as inverse fast Fourier transforms (IFFT) and finite field arithmetic to reconstruct the original data. The script is structured to handle different cases of data erasure and corruption, ensuring that the recovered data is accurate. This Python script is a utility for automating the creation of specialized C functions that are part of a larger system for data integrity and recovery, likely used in storage systems or communication protocols where data reliability is critical.
# Global Variables

---
### indent
- **Type**: `int`
- **Description**: The `indent` variable is a global integer that tracks the current level of indentation for formatted output. It is used to adjust the indentation level when printing strings, particularly in the context of code generation or structured text output.
- **Use**: This variable is used to manage and adjust the indentation level dynamically as strings are printed, increasing or decreasing based on the presence of certain characters ('{' and '}').


# Functions

---
### cprint<!-- {{#callable:firedancer/src/ballet/reedsol/generate_recover.cprint}} -->
The `cprint` function prints a string to a global output file with indentation based on the presence of curly braces in the string.
- **Inputs**:
    - `string`: The string to be printed, which may contain indentation control characters ('{' and '}').
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if the input string is empty or contains only whitespace; if so, print a blank line to the output file and return.
    - If the string contains a closing brace '}', decrease the global indentation level by one.
    - Print the string to the output file, prefixed by spaces corresponding to the current indentation level.
    - If the string contains an opening brace '{', increase the global indentation level by one.
- **Output**: The function does not return any value; it outputs the formatted string to a global file object `outf`.

### make\_recover\_var<!-- {{#callable:firedancer/src/ballet/reedsol/generate_recover.make_recover_var}} -->
The `make_recover_var` function generates C code for a Reed-Solomon recovery function that handles variable numbers of data and parity shreds.
- **Inputs**:
    - `n`: The number of shreds to be processed, which determines the size of arrays and the function name.
    - `max_shreds`: The maximum number of shreds that can be processed, used to determine loop bounds and conditional logic.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Opens a file named 'fd_reedsol_recover_{n}.c' for writing, where {n} is the input parameter.
    - Writes C code to the file, starting with includes and a function declaration for a Reed-Solomon recovery function.
    - Initializes arrays `_erased` and `pi` with size `n` and calculates `shred_cnt` as the sum of `data_shred_cnt` and `parity_shred_cnt`.
    - Iterates over `n` to determine which shreds are loaded based on the `erased` array and updates `_erased` and `loaded_cnt`.
    - Checks if `loaded_cnt` is less than `data_shred_cnt` and returns an error if true.
    - Generates a permutation index `pi` using a function call specific to `n`.
    - Initializes a variable `diff` to track differences in regenerated shreds.
    - Iterates over `shred_sz` to process each shred position, loading data into vectors and performing operations like IFFT, FDERIV, and FFT.
    - Handles different cases for storing, comparing, and reloading shreds based on their erased status using macros.
    - If `max_shreds` is greater than `n`, processes remaining shreds in chunks, updating `shreds_remaining` and using IFFT and FFT operations.
    - Checks for any differences in regenerated shreds and returns an error if any are found.
    - Updates `shred_pos` and ensures it does not exceed `shred_sz`.
    - Returns success if all operations complete without errors.
- **Output**: The function outputs C code to a file that implements a Reed-Solomon recovery function for the specified number of shreds.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`firedancer/src/ballet/reedsol/generate_recover.cprint`](#cprint)
