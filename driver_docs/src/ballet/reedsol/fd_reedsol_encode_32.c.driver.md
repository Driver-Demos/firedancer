# Purpose
This C source code file defines a function named [`fd_reedsol_private_encode_32`](#fd_reedsol_private_encode_32), which is part of an implementation of Reed-Solomon error correction coding. The function is designed to generate parity shreds from a given set of data shreds, which is a common operation in data redundancy and error correction schemes. The function takes in parameters specifying the size of each shred, pointers to arrays of data shreds, the count of data shreds, pointers to arrays of parity shreds, and the count of parity shreds. The core functionality involves loading data shreds, performing operations to generate parity shreds using finite field arithmetic (as indicated by the use of `gf_t` types and functions like `gf_ldu` and `gf_stu`), and storing the resulting parity shreds.

The code is structured to handle different numbers of data shreds, with specific operations for each case, utilizing macros like `FD_REEDSOL_GENERATE_IFFT` and `FD_REEDSOL_GENERATE_PPT` to perform the necessary mathematical transformations. The function is marked with `FD_FN_UNSANITIZED`, indicating that it may not include certain safety checks, likely for performance reasons in a controlled environment. This file is likely part of a larger library focused on data integrity and recovery, and it does not define a public API directly but rather serves as an internal component of the Reed-Solomon encoding process. The use of macros and manual loop control suggests a focus on optimizing performance for high-throughput or resource-constrained environments.

### fd\_reedsol\_private\_encode\_32<!-- {{#callable:fd_reedsol_private_encode_32}} -->
The `fd_reedsol_private_encode_32` function generates parity shreds from data shreds using Reed-Solomon encoding for error correction.
- **Inputs**:
    - `shred_sz`: The size of each shred in bytes.
    - `data_shred`: An array of pointers to the data shreds to be encoded.
    - `data_shred_cnt`: The number of data shreds.
    - `parity_shred`: An array of pointers to store the generated parity shreds.
    - `parity_shred_cnt`: The number of parity shreds to generate.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize a loop to iterate over each position in the shreds up to `shred_sz`.
    - Load data from each data shred into variables `in00` to `in15`, and conditionally load more based on `data_shred_cnt`.
    - Use a switch statement to apply different Reed-Solomon encoding operations (`FD_REEDSOL_GENERATE_IFFT` or `FD_REEDSOL_GENERATE_PPT`) based on `data_shred_cnt`.
    - Calculate the number of parity shreds produced and remaining, and store the generated parity shreds into `parity_shred` array.
    - If more parity shreds are needed, generate additional parity shreds using `FD_REEDSOL_GENERATE_FFT` and store them.
    - Adjust `shred_pos` to handle cases where `shred_sz` is not divisible by 32.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value but modifies the `parity_shred` array to contain the generated parity shreds.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`gf_ldu`](fd_reedsol_arith_none.h.driver.md#gf_ldu)
