# Purpose
This C header file, `fd_reedsol_arith_avx2.h`, is part of a larger library focused on arithmetic operations for Reed-Solomon error correction codes, specifically optimized for AVX2 (Advanced Vector Extensions 2) instruction set. The file is not intended to be included directly; instead, it should be accessed through `fd_reedsol_private.h`, ensuring proper encapsulation and dependency management. The file defines a set of macros and functions that leverage SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) operations to perform efficient Galois Field arithmetic, which is crucial for the encoding and decoding processes in Reed-Solomon codes. The use of AVX2 allows for parallel processing of data, significantly enhancing performance for applications that require high-speed data integrity checks and error correction.

Key components of this file include the definition of `gf_t` as a type alias for `wb_t`, which represents a wide byte type used in SIMD operations. The file provides macros for loading, storing, zeroing, and performing arithmetic operations such as addition, multiplication, and logical OR on Galois Field elements. The multiplication operations, `GF_MUL` and `GF_MUL_VAR`, are particularly noteworthy as they utilize AVX2 intrinsics like `_mm256_shuffle_epi8` to perform byte-level shuffling and multiplication, optimized for compile-time constants. The file also includes a precomputed lookup table, `fd_reedsol_arith_scale4`, which aids in these operations. This header is a specialized component of a broader library, providing a high-performance, low-level interface for Galois Field arithmetic tailored for systems that support AVX2.
