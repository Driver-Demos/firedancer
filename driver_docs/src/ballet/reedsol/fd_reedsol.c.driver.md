# Purpose
This C source code file is part of a library that implements Reed-Solomon error correction, a method used to detect and correct errors in data transmission or storage. The file includes functionality for encoding and recovering data using Reed-Solomon codes, specifically tailored for different arithmetic implementations, as indicated by the conditional compilation directives. The code imports binary constants based on the arithmetic implementation selected, which could be generic, AVX2, or GFNI, optimizing the performance for different hardware capabilities.

The file defines several functions: [`fd_reedsol_encode_fini`](#fd_reedsol_encode_fini), [`fd_reedsol_recover_fini`](#fd_reedsol_recover_fini), and [`fd_reedsol_strerror`](#fd_reedsol_strerror). The [`fd_reedsol_encode_fini`](#fd_reedsol_encode_fini) function finalizes the encoding process by selecting the appropriate private encoding function based on the number of data and parity shreds. Similarly, [`fd_reedsol_recover_fini`](#fd_reedsol_recover_fini) finalizes the recovery process by determining the number of unerased shreds and selecting the appropriate recovery function. The [`fd_reedsol_strerror`](#fd_reedsol_strerror) function provides human-readable error messages corresponding to error codes. This file is likely part of a larger library, as it relies on private functions and constants, and it does not define a main function, indicating it is not an executable but rather a component intended to be used by other parts of the software.

# Functions

### fd\_reedsol\_encode\_fini<!-- {{#callable:fd_reedsol_encode_fini}} -->
The `fd_reedsol_encode_fini` function finalizes the encoding process for Reed-Solomon error correction by selecting the appropriate encoding function based on the number of data and parity shreds, and then resets the shred counts.
- **Inputs**:
    - `rs`: A pointer to an `fd_reedsol_t` structure, which contains the data and parity shreds, shred size, and other necessary information for encoding.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if the arithmetic implementation is 3 and both data and parity shred counts are 32, then call `fd_reedsol_private_encode_32_32`.
    - If the data shred count is less than or equal to 16, call [`fd_reedsol_private_encode_16`](fd_reedsol_encode_16.c.driver.md#fd_reedsol_private_encode_16).
    - If the data shred count is less than or equal to 32, call [`fd_reedsol_private_encode_32`](fd_reedsol_encode_32.c.driver.md#fd_reedsol_private_encode_32).
    - If the data shred count is less than or equal to 64, call [`fd_reedsol_private_encode_64`](fd_reedsol_encode_64.c.driver.md#fd_reedsol_private_encode_64).
    - Otherwise, call [`fd_reedsol_private_encode_128`](fd_reedsol_encode_128.c.driver.md#fd_reedsol_private_encode_128).
    - Reset `data_shred_cnt` and `parity_shred_cnt` to 0.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it modifies the `fd_reedsol_t` structure in place, specifically resetting the data and parity shred counts.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`fd_reedsol_private_encode_16`](fd_reedsol_encode_16.c.driver.md#fd_reedsol_private_encode_16)
    - [`fd_reedsol_private_encode_32`](fd_reedsol_encode_32.c.driver.md#fd_reedsol_private_encode_32)
    - [`fd_reedsol_private_encode_64`](fd_reedsol_encode_64.c.driver.md#fd_reedsol_private_encode_64)
    - [`fd_reedsol_private_encode_128`](fd_reedsol_encode_128.c.driver.md#fd_reedsol_private_encode_128)

### fd\_reedsol\_recover\_fini<!-- {{#callable:fd_reedsol_recover_fini}} -->
The `fd_reedsol_recover_fini` function finalizes the recovery process of Reed-Solomon encoded data by determining the number of unerased shreds and invoking the appropriate recovery function based on the number of unerased shreds.
- **Inputs**:
    - `rs`: A pointer to an `fd_reedsol_t` structure, which contains information about the data and parity shreds, as well as the recovery state.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize `data_shred_cnt` and `parity_shred_cnt` from the `rs` structure.
    - Reset `data_shred_cnt` and `parity_shred_cnt` in the `rs` structure to zero.
    - Iterate over the total number of shreds (data + parity) to count the number of unerased shreds.
    - If the number of unerased shreds is not equal to `data_shred_cnt`, return `FD_REEDSOL_ERR_PARTIAL`.
    - Based on the number of unerased shreds, call the appropriate recovery function (`fd_reedsol_private_recover_var_*`) to handle the recovery process.
- **Output**: Returns an integer status code indicating the success or failure of the recovery process, with specific codes for partial recovery or success.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`fd_reedsol_private_recover_var_16`](fd_reedsol_recover_16.c.driver.md#fd_reedsol_private_recover_var_16)
    - [`fd_reedsol_private_recover_var_32`](fd_reedsol_recover_32.c.driver.md#fd_reedsol_private_recover_var_32)
    - [`fd_reedsol_private_recover_var_64`](fd_reedsol_recover_64.c.driver.md#fd_reedsol_private_recover_var_64)
    - [`fd_reedsol_private_recover_var_128`](fd_reedsol_recover_128.c.driver.md#fd_reedsol_private_recover_var_128)
    - [`fd_reedsol_private_recover_var_256`](fd_reedsol_recover_256.c.driver.md#fd_reedsol_private_recover_var_256)

### fd\_reedsol\_strerror<!-- {{#callable:fd_reedsol_strerror}} -->
The `fd_reedsol_strerror` function returns a string description of an error code related to Reed-Solomon operations.
- **Inputs**:
    - `err`: An integer representing the error code for which a string description is needed.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function uses a switch statement to check the value of the input error code `err`.
    - If `err` matches `FD_REEDSOL_SUCCESS`, the function returns the string "success".
    - If `err` matches `FD_REEDSOL_ERR_CORRUPT`, the function returns the string "corrupt".
    - If `err` matches `FD_REEDSOL_ERR_PARTIAL`, the function returns the string "partial".
    - If `err` does not match any of the predefined error codes, the function returns the string "unknown".
- **Output**: A constant character pointer to a string describing the error code.
