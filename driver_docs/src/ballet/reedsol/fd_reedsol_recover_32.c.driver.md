# Purpose
This C source code file is part of an implementation of a Reed-Solomon error correction algorithm, specifically designed to recover data from a set of shreds, which are fragments of data that may include both original data and parity information. The function [`fd_reedsol_private_recover_var_32`](#fd_reedsol_private_recover_var_32) is the primary component of this file, and it is responsible for reconstructing missing or corrupted data shreds using the Reed-Solomon coding technique. The function takes in parameters such as the size of each shred, pointers to the shreds themselves, the count of data and parity shreds, and an array indicating which shreds are erased. It then attempts to recover the original data by leveraging the parity information and the properties of Galois Fields, which are mathematical structures used in error correction codes.

The code is highly specialized and focuses on a narrow functionality of data recovery using Reed-Solomon codes. It includes operations such as loading data shreds, performing inverse fast Fourier transforms (IFFT), and forward fast Fourier transforms (FFT), and checking for data integrity by comparing regenerated shreds with existing ones. The file is auto-generated, indicating that it might be part of a larger system where such files are created programmatically to handle specific configurations or optimizations. The function does not define a public API or external interface directly, as it is marked as a private function, suggesting it is intended for internal use within a library or application that implements Reed-Solomon error correction.

### fd\_reedsol\_private\_recover\_var\_32<!-- {{#callable:fd_reedsol_private_recover_var_32}} -->
The function `fd_reedsol_private_recover_var_32` attempts to recover data from a set of shreds using Reed-Solomon error correction, ensuring that the data is consistent and uncorrupted.
- **Inputs**:
    - `shred_sz`: The size of each shred in bytes.
    - `shred`: An array of pointers to the shreds, where each pointer points to a shred of data.
    - `data_shred_cnt`: The number of data shreds available.
    - `parity_shred_cnt`: The number of parity shreds available.
    - `erased`: An array indicating which shreds are erased (1 if erased, 0 if not).
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize arrays `_erased` and `pi` to track erased shreds and permutation indices, respectively.
    - Calculate the total number of shreds (`shred_cnt`) and initialize `loaded_cnt` to count loaded data shreds.
    - Iterate over the first 32 shreds to determine which shreds can be loaded based on the `erased` array and update `_erased` and `loaded_cnt` accordingly.
    - If the number of loaded data shreds is less than `data_shred_cnt`, return an error indicating partial data.
    - Generate permutation indices using [`fd_reedsol_private_gen_pi_32`](fd_reedsol_pi.c.driver.md#fd_reedsol_private_gen_pi_32) based on `_erased`.
    - Initialize `diff` to track differences between regenerated and original shreds.
    - Iterate over each position in the shreds, loading data into variables `in00` to `in31`, setting erased positions to zero.
    - Multiply each loaded value by its corresponding permutation index from `pi`.
    - Perform inverse FFT, derivative, and FFT operations on the loaded data using macros `FD_REEDSOL_GENERATE_IFFT`, `FD_REEDSOL_GENERATE_FDERIV`, and `FD_REEDSOL_GENERATE_FFT`.
    - Multiply the results by the permutation indices again to prepare for storing or comparing.
    - Use a switch-case structure to handle storing, comparing, or reloading shreds based on their erased status and position.
    - If any differences are detected in the comparison, return an error indicating corruption.
    - Advance the shred position manually, ensuring it does not exceed `shred_sz`.
    - Return success if all operations complete without detecting errors.
- **Output**: Returns an integer status code: `FD_REEDSOL_SUCCESS` if recovery is successful, `FD_REEDSOL_ERR_PARTIAL` if not enough data shreds are available, or `FD_REEDSOL_ERR_CORRUPT` if a corruption is detected.
