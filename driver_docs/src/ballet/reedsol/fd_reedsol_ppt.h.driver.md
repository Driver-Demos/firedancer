# Purpose
The provided C code is a header file that implements the Principal Pivot Transform (PPT) for the Reed-Solomon Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) operator, forming part of a larger library focused on error correction codes, particularly Reed-Solomon codes. These codes are essential in data transmission and storage systems for detecting and correcting errors. The code is auto-generated, suggesting it is part of a system that produces optimized implementations for specific parameters, focusing on the computation of the PPT for data shreds that are not powers of two. It defines macros and function prototypes for various configurations, such as `FD_REEDSOL_PPT_IMPL_64_36` and `FD_REEDSOL_PPT_IMPL_64_48`, which handle different numbers of data and parity symbols using Galois Field arithmetic. These internal components are designed for integration into larger systems, leveraging SIMD operations for performance, and are intended to be wrapped by higher-level functions or interfaces, providing flexible and efficient error correction solutions without directly defining public APIs.

### fd\_reedsol\_ppt\_32\_17<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_reedsol_ppt_32_17}} -->
Generates a Reed-Solomon parity for 32 input elements.
- **Description**: This function computes the Reed-Solomon parity for a set of 32 input elements, which are expected to be pointers to `gf_t` types.

### fd\_reedsol\_ppt\_32\_30<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_reedsol_ppt_32_30}} -->
Generates a 32,30 Reed-Solomon parity check.
- **Description**: This function is used to generate a Reed-Solomon parity check for a set of 32 input symbols, where 30 of them are data symbols and the remaining are parity symbols. It is typically used in error correction scenarios to ensure data integrity. The function modifies the input symbols in place, so the caller must ensure that the input pointers are valid and point to writable memory locations. It is important to provide exactly 32 input pointers, each pointing to a valid `gf_t` type, as the function does not perform any bounds checking or validation on the inputs.
- **Inputs**:
    - `_in00`: Pointer to a `gf_t` type representing the first input symbol. Must not be null.
    - `_in01`: Pointer to a `gf_t` type representing the second input symbol. Must not be null.

Performs a Reed-Solomon encoding operation on 64 input elements.
- **Description**: This function applies a Reed-Solomon encoding operation to 64 input elements, which are expected to be pointers to elements of type `gf_t`. It is typically used in error correction coding to generate parity information from the input data. The function modifies the input elements in place, so the caller must ensure that the input pointers are valid and point to writable memory. This function should be called when the input data is ready for encoding, and the caller should handle any necessary synchronization if used in a multithreaded context.

### fd\_reedsol\_ppt\_64\_45<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_reedsol_ppt_64_45}} -->
Generates a Reed-Solomon parity for 64 input symbols.
- **Description**: This function is used to compute the parity symbols for a Reed-Solomon code with 64 input symbols and 45 data symbols. It is typically called when encoding data for error correction purposes. The function modifies the input symbols in place to include the parity information. It is important to ensure that all input pointers are valid and point to initialized `gf_t` values before calling this function. The function does not perform any input validation, so invalid pointers or uninitialized data may lead to undefined behavior.
- **Inputs**:

### fd\_reedsol\_ppt\_64\_46<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_reedsol_ppt_64_46}} -->
Performs a Reed-Solomon encoding operation on 64 input elements.
- **Description**: This function applies a Reed-Solomon encoding operation to 64 input elements, which are expected to be pointers to elements of type `gf_t`. It is typically used in error correction coding to generate parity data from the input data. The function modifies the input elements in place, so the caller must ensure that the input pointers are valid and point to writable memory. This function should be called when you need to encode data for error correction purposes, and it assumes that the input pointers are correctly initialized and non-null.

### fd\_reedsol\_ppt\_64\_49<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_reedsol_ppt_64_49}} -->
Performs a Reed-Solomon encoding operation on 64 input elements.
- **Description**: This function applies a Reed-Solomon encoding operation to 64 input elements, which are expected to be pointers to elements of type `gf_t`. It is typically used in error correction coding to generate parity data from the input data. The function modifies the input elements in place, so the caller must ensure that the input pointers are valid and point to writable memory. This function should be called when the input data is ready for encoding, and the caller is prepared to handle the modified data.

Performs a Reed-Solomon encoding operation on 64 input elements.
- **Description**: This function applies a Reed-Solomon encoding operation to 64 input elements, which are expected to be pointers to `gf_t` types.

The function modifies the input values in place, so the caller must ensure that the input pointers are valid and point to writable memory. This function does not perform any input validation, so it is the caller's responsibility to ensure that all pointers are non-null and correctly initialized before calling this function.

### fd\_reedsol\_ppt\_64\_60<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_reedsol_ppt_64_60}} -->
Processes 64 input elements using a Reed-Solomon algorithm.
- **Description**: This function applies a Reed-Solomon error correction algorithm to 64 input elements, each represented by a pointer to a `gf_t` type. It is typically used in scenarios where data integrity is critical, such as in data transmission or storage systems. The function expects all input pointers to be valid and non-null, as it reads from and writes back to these locations. Users must ensure that the input pointers point to valid memory locations before calling this function. The function does not return a value but modifies the input data in place.

### fd\_reedsol\_ppt\_64\_63<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_reedsol_ppt_64_63}} -->
Performs a Reed-Solomon encoding operation on 64 input elements.
- **Description**: This function applies a Reed-Solomon encoding operation to 64 input elements, each represented by a pointer to a `gf_t` type. It is typically used in error correction scenarios where data integrity is critical. The function modifies the input values in place, so the caller must ensure that the input pointers are valid and point to writable memory locations. It is important to note that the function does not perform any input validation, so the caller must ensure that all pointers are non-null and correctly initialized before calling this function.

### fd\_reedsol\_ppt\_128\_66<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_reedsol_ppt_128_66}} -->
Performs a Reed-Solomon encoding operation on 128 input elements.
- **Description**: This function applies a Reed-Solomon encoding operation to 128 input elements, each represented by a pointer to a `gf_t` type. It is typically used in error correction scenarios where data integrity is critical. The function expects all input pointers to be valid and non-null, as it reads from and writes back to these locations. The caller must ensure that the input pointers point to valid memory locations before calling this function. The function does not return a value, but it modifies the data at the input locations to reflect the encoded result.

### fd\_reedsol\_ppt\_128\_67<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_reedsol_ppt_128_67}} -->
Performs a Reed-Solomon encoding operation on 128 input elements.
- **Description**: This function applies a Reed-Solomon encoding operation to 128 input elements, each represented by a pointer to a `gf_t` type. It is typically used in error correction scenarios where data integrity is critical. The function expects all input pointers to be valid and non-null, as it reads from and writes back to these locations. The caller must ensure that the input data is correctly initialized before calling this function. The function does not return a value, but it modifies the input data in place, reflecting the results of the encoding operation.
