# Purpose
This C header file, `fd_reedsol_arith_gfni.h`, is part of a larger library focused on arithmetic operations in Galois Fields, specifically optimized for use with Intel's AVX (Advanced Vector Extensions) and GFNI (Galois Field New Instructions) instruction sets. The file is not intended to be included directly; instead, it should be accessed through `fd_reedsol_private.h`, ensuring that it is used within the correct context of the library. The file defines a set of macros and functions for performing arithmetic operations in a Galois Field, such as addition, multiplication, and logical operations, using SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) operations to leverage parallel processing capabilities of modern CPUs.

The file provides a narrow but highly specialized functionality, focusing on efficient Galois Field arithmetic, which is crucial for error correction algorithms like Reed-Solomon. It defines macros for loading, storing, and zeroing data, as well as for performing addition and multiplication operations. The multiplication operations are particularly noteworthy, as they include conditional compilation to handle differences in compiler versions, specifically addressing a bug in older versions of GCC. The file also includes an external constant array, `fd_reedsol_arith_consts_gfni_mul`, which is aligned for optimal memory access. This header is designed to be part of a larger system, providing low-level, performance-critical operations that can be used to build more complex error correction algorithms.

### fd\_reedsol\_arith\_consts\_gfni\_mul
- **Type**: `uchar const[]`
- **Description**: The `fd_reedsol_arith_consts_gfni_mul` is an external constant array of unsigned characters, aligned to 128 bytes. It is used in the context of Galois Field arithmetic operations, specifically for multiplication using the GFNI (Galois Field New Instructions) set.
- **Use**: This variable is used to store precomputed constants for efficient Galois Field multiplication operations in the Reed-Solomon error correction algorithm.
