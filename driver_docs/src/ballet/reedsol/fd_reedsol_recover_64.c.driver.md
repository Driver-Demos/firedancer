# Purpose
This C source code file is part of an implementation of a Reed-Solomon error correction algorithm, specifically designed to recover data from a set of shreds, which are fragments of data that may include both original data and parity information. The function [`fd_reedsol_private_recover_var_64`](#fd_reedsol_private_recover_var_64) is the primary component of this file, and it is responsible for reconstructing missing or corrupted data shreds using the Reed-Solomon coding technique. The function takes in parameters such as the size of each shred, pointers to the shreds themselves, the count of data and parity shreds, and an array indicating which shreds are erased. It uses these inputs to determine which shreds need to be regenerated and performs a series of operations involving finite field arithmetic to achieve data recovery.

The code is highly specialized and optimized for performance, as evidenced by the use of macros and inline functions for operations like loading and storing data, as well as performing fast Fourier transforms (FFT) and inverse FFTs (IFFT). The function is designed to handle up to 64 shreds at a time, leveraging vectorized operations to efficiently process data in parallel. The use of conditional logic and bitwise operations ensures that the function can handle various scenarios, such as partial data availability and data corruption, returning appropriate error codes when necessary. This file is likely part of a larger library focused on data integrity and recovery, and it does not define public APIs or external interfaces directly, as it is marked as a private function intended for internal use within the library.

### fd\_reedsol\_private\_recover\_var\_64<!-- {{#callable:fd_reedsol_private_recover_var_64}} -->
The function `fd_reedsol_private_recover_var_64` attempts to recover data from a set of shreds using Reed-Solomon error correction, handling up to 64 shreds at a time.
- **Inputs**:
    - `shred_sz`: The size of each shred in bytes.
    - `shred`: An array of pointers to the shreds, where each pointer points to a shred of data.
    - `data_shred_cnt`: The number of data shreds available.
    - `parity_shred_cnt`: The number of parity shreds available.
    - `erased`: An array indicating which shreds are erased (1 for erased, 0 for not erased).
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize arrays `_erased` and `pi` to track erased shreds and permutation indices respectively.
    - Calculate the total number of shreds (`shred_cnt`) and initialize `loaded_cnt` to count loaded data shreds.
    - Iterate over the first 64 shreds to determine which shreds can be loaded based on the `erased` array and update `_erased` and `loaded_cnt` accordingly.
    - If the number of loaded data shreds is less than `data_shred_cnt`, return an error indicating partial data.
    - Generate permutation indices using [`fd_reedsol_private_gen_pi_64`](fd_reedsol_pi.c.driver.md#fd_reedsol_private_gen_pi_64) based on `_erased`.
    - Initialize `diff` to zero to track differences between regenerated and original shreds.
    - Iterate over each position in the shreds, loading data into variables `in00` to `in63`, setting erased positions to zero.
    - Multiply each loaded value by its corresponding permutation index from `pi`.
    - Perform inverse FFT, derivative, and FFT operations on the loaded data using `FD_REEDSOL_GENERATE_IFFT`, `FD_REEDSOL_GENERATE_FDERIV`, and `FD_REEDSOL_GENERATE_FFT`.
    - Multiply the results by the permutation indices again to prepare for storage or comparison.
    - Use a switch statement to handle storing, comparing, or reloading shreds based on their erased status and position.
    - If any differences are detected in the comparison, return an error indicating corruption.
    - Advance the shred position by `GF_WIDTH` and adjust if necessary to avoid exceeding `shred_sz`.
    - Return success if all operations complete without errors.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer status code: `FD_REEDSOL_SUCCESS` on successful recovery, `FD_REEDSOL_ERR_PARTIAL` if not enough data shreds are available, or `FD_REEDSOL_ERR_CORRUPT` if a corruption is detected.
