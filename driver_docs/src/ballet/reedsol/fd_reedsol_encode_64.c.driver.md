# Purpose
This C source code file defines a function [`fd_reedsol_private_encode_64`](#fd_reedsol_private_encode_64), which is part of an implementation of Reed-Solomon encoding, a type of error correction code. The function is designed to generate parity shreds from a set of data shreds, which are used to recover lost or corrupted data in storage or transmission systems. The function takes in parameters specifying the size of each shred, pointers to arrays of data shreds, the count of data shreds, pointers to arrays of parity shreds, and the count of parity shreds. The function processes the data shreds to compute the necessary parity shreds using operations over a Galois Field, which is typical in Reed-Solomon encoding.

The code is structured to handle up to 64 data shreds and uses a series of switch-case statements to manage different counts of data shreds, ensuring that the correct number of parity shreds is generated. The function utilizes macros and helper functions (such as `gf_ldu`, `gf_stu`, and `FD_REEDSOL_GENERATE_IFFT`) to perform operations on the data, which are likely defined in the included header file `fd_reedsol_ppt.h`. The use of `FD_FN_UNSANITIZED` suggests that this function is optimized for performance, possibly at the expense of some safety checks, which is common in high-performance computing scenarios. The file is auto-generated, indicating that it might be part of a larger codebase where such functions are generated based on specific parameters or configurations.

### fd\_reedsol\_private\_encode\_64<!-- {{#callable:fd_reedsol_private_encode_64}} -->
The function `fd_reedsol_private_encode_64` generates parity shreds from data shreds using Reed-Solomon encoding for error correction.
- **Inputs**:
    - `shred_sz`: The size of each shred in bytes.
    - `data_shred`: An array of pointers to the data shreds to be encoded.
    - `data_shred_cnt`: The number of data shreds.
    - `parity_shred`: An array of pointers to the parity shreds where the encoded data will be stored.
    - `parity_shred_cnt`: The number of parity shreds to be generated.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize a loop to iterate over each position in the shreds up to `shred_sz`.
    - Load data from each data shred into `gf_t` variables for the first 32 shreds, and conditionally load more based on `data_shred_cnt`.
    - Use a switch statement to apply different Reed-Solomon encoding functions based on `data_shred_cnt`.
    - Calculate the number of parity shreds needed and store them in the `parity_shred` array.
    - If more parity shreds are needed, generate additional parity shreds using FFT and IFFT operations.
    - Adjust `shred_pos` to handle cases where `shred_sz` is not divisible by 32.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value but modifies the `parity_shred` array to contain the generated parity shreds.
