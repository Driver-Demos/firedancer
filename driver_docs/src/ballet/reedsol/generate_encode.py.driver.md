# Purpose
This Python script is designed to generate C source code files for encoding data using Reed-Solomon error correction algorithms. The script defines a function [`make_encode`](#make_encode) that takes parameters specifying the range of data shreds and the maximum number of parity shreds. It then generates a C file with a specific naming convention based on the number of data shreds, which includes the implementation of a function for encoding data shreds into parity shreds. The generated C code is structured to handle different numbers of data shreds and parity shreds, using conditional logic and loops to manage the encoding process. The script uses a helper function [`cprint`](#cprint) to manage indentation and formatting of the generated C code, ensuring that the code is well-structured and readable.

The script is not intended to be a standalone executable but rather a utility for generating C code files that can be compiled and used in a larger system. It leverages global variables and file operations to write the generated code to disk. The generated C code includes function definitions and logic for handling different cases of data and parity shreds, using macros and function calls to perform the necessary mathematical operations for Reed-Solomon encoding. This script is a specialized tool for developers working with Reed-Solomon codes, providing a way to automate the creation of encoding functions tailored to specific parameters.
# Global Variables

---
### indent
- **Type**: `int`
- **Description**: The `indent` variable is a global integer that is used to manage the indentation level for formatted output in the `cprint` function. It is initialized to 0 and is adjusted based on the presence of curly braces in the strings being printed, decreasing when a closing brace '}' is encountered and increasing when an opening brace '{' is encountered.
- **Use**: This variable is used to control the indentation of lines printed to the output file, ensuring that the code structure is visually represented with appropriate indentation.


# Functions

---
### cprint<!-- {{#callable:firedancer/src/ballet/reedsol/generate_encode.cprint}} -->
The `cprint` function prints a string to a global file with indentation that adjusts based on the presence of curly braces in the string.
- **Inputs**:
    - `string`: The string to be printed, which may contain curly braces that affect indentation.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Checks if the string contains a closing curly brace '}', and if so, decrements the global `indent` variable by 1.
    - Prints the string to the global file `outf`, prefixed by spaces corresponding to the current indentation level (2 spaces per indent level).
    - Checks if the string contains an opening curly brace '{', and if so, increments the global `indent` variable by 1.
- **Output**: The function does not return any value; it outputs the formatted string to the global file `outf`.


---
### make\_encode<!-- {{#callable:firedancer/src/ballet/reedsol/generate_encode.make_encode}} -->
The `make_encode` function generates a C source file that implements a Reed-Solomon encoding function for a specified range of data and parity shreds.
- **Inputs**:
    - `min_data_shreds`: The minimum number of data shreds to be considered for encoding.
    - `max_data_shreds`: The maximum number of data shreds to be considered for encoding.
    - `max_parity_shreds`: The maximum number of parity shreds that can be generated.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Calculate `n` as the smallest power of 2 greater than or equal to `max_data_shreds`.
    - Open a file named `fd_reedsol_encode_{n}.c` for writing.
    - Write the function signature and initial setup for a C function that performs Reed-Solomon encoding.
    - Initialize input variables for data shreds using a loop, setting unused variables to zero.
    - Use a switch statement to load data shreds into variables based on `data_shred_cnt`.
    - Define macros for all variables and their references if `n` is 64 or more.
    - Use another switch statement to generate parity shreds using IFFT or PPT functions based on `data_shred_cnt`.
    - Calculate the total number of shreds and use a switch statement to store the required parity shreds.
    - Iteratively generate additional parity shreds if needed, using FFT and IFFT functions, until all required parity shreds are produced.
    - Adjust `shred_pos` to handle non-divisible shred sizes by clamping it appropriately.
- **Output**: The function outputs a C source file that contains the implementation of a Reed-Solomon encoding function tailored to the specified parameters.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`firedancer/src/ballet/reedsol/generate_encode.cprint`](#cprint)
