# Purpose
This Python script is designed to generate a C header file (`fd_reedsol_fderiv.h`) that implements the formal derivative computation of polynomials over a finite field, specifically GF(2^8). The script uses the `galois` library to perform arithmetic operations in the finite field and `numpy` for numerical computations. The primary functionality of the generated C code is encapsulated in the macro `FD_REEDSOL_GEN_FDERIV`, which computes the formal derivative of a polynomial represented in the coefficient basis. This derivative is useful in coding theory, particularly in error correction algorithms, as it adheres to the formal equivalent of the product rule.

The script constructs several lookup tables (`svals`, `sbar`, and `sbarprime`) to facilitate efficient computation of the formal derivative. It then generates macros for different polynomial lengths (16, 32, 64, 128, and 256), which are powers of two, as required by the algorithm. These macros perform vectorized operations to compute the derivative, leveraging the properties of the finite field to optimize the process. The script outputs the generated C code to a file, ensuring that the macros are defined with appropriate input and output handling. This code is intended to be included in larger projects that require polynomial derivative computations over finite fields, such as those involving Reed-Solomon error correction.

# Global Variables

---
### header
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: The `header` variable is a multi-line string that contains C preprocessor directives and comments for an auto-generated header file. This header file is designed to implement the formal derivative computation of a polynomial stored in the coefficient basis, specifically for use with Reed-Solomon error correction codes over a finite field GF(2^8).
- **Use**: The `header` variable is used to write the contents of the auto-generated header file `fd_reedsol_fderiv.h`, which includes macros and implementation details for polynomial derivative computations.


---
### outf
- **Type**: `file object`
- **Description**: The variable `outf` is a file object that is opened for writing text to a file named 'fd_reedsol_fderiv.h'. This file is intended to store the auto-generated C header content for computing the formal derivative of a polynomial over a finite field.
- **Use**: `outf` is used to write the generated header content, including macros and definitions, to the specified file.


---
### GF
- **Type**: `galois.GF`
- **Description**: The variable `GF` is an instance of a Galois Field of order 2^8, created using the `galois` library. A Galois Field, also known as a finite field, is a field that contains a finite number of elements, and in this case, it is a field with 256 elements (2^8). This field is used for arithmetic operations in the context of error correction and cryptography.
- **Use**: `GF` is used to perform arithmetic operations over the finite field GF(2^8), which is essential for computing the formal derivative of polynomials in the given code.


---
### svals
- **Type**: `dictionary`
- **Description**: The `svals` variable is a dictionary that stores precomputed values used in the formal derivative computation of polynomials over the finite field GF(2^8). It is indexed by tuples of the form (j, x), where j is an integer from 0 to 7 and x is an integer from 0 to 255. The values are elements of the Galois field GF(2^8), calculated based on the previous values in the dictionary.
- **Use**: This variable is used to store intermediate results for the computation of polynomial derivatives in a finite field, facilitating efficient access and reuse of these values.


---
### sbar
- **Type**: `dict`
- **Description**: The `sbar` variable is a dictionary that stores precomputed values used in the formal derivative computation of polynomials over the finite field GF(2^8). It is indexed by tuples of two integers, where the first integer ranges from 0 to 7 and the second from 0 to 255. Each entry in `sbar` is calculated by dividing a value from the `svals` dictionary by another specific value from `svals`. This precomputation is part of the optimization for polynomial operations in the finite field.
- **Use**: `sbar` is used to store and retrieve precomputed values that facilitate efficient computation of polynomial derivatives in the finite field GF(2^8).


---
### sbarprime
- **Type**: `list`
- **Description**: The variable `sbarprime` is a list that initially contains a single element, the integer 1. It is then populated with additional elements through a loop that iterates from 1 to 7. In each iteration, a value `sprimek` is calculated using the product of a range of elements in the Galois Field GF(2^8) and a division by a specific value from the `svals` dictionary. This value is then appended to the `sbarprime` list.
- **Use**: This variable is used to store precomputed values that are later utilized in the computation of the formal derivative of a polynomial over a finite field.


---
### B
- **Type**: `list`
- **Description**: The variable `B` is a list that contains 256 elements, each representing a product of certain precomputed values from the `sbarprime` list. These products are determined by the binary representation of the index `i`, where each bit in `i` determines whether a corresponding element from `sbarprime` is included in the product.
- **Use**: This list is used in the macro generation process to scale input values by elements of `B` in the formal derivative computation of polynomials over a finite field.


# Functions

---
### print\_macro<!-- {{#callable:firedancer/src/ballet/reedsol/generate_fderiv.print_macro}} -->
The `print_macro` function generates and writes a C-style macro definition to a file, formatting it with specified arguments and lines of code.
- **Inputs**:
    - `macro_name`: The name of the macro to be defined.
    - `args`: A list of argument names for the macro.
    - `lines`: A list of strings representing the lines of code to be included in the macro.
    - `indent`: An optional integer specifying the number of spaces to use for indentation, defaulting to 2.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize the first line of the macro definition with the macro name and the first argument.
    - Calculate the maximum width for formatting based on the longest line in `lines` plus additional space for indentation and formatting.
    - Iterate over the remaining arguments, appending them to the first line, ensuring the line does not exceed the maximum width; if it does, print the line and start a new line with proper indentation.
    - Complete the first line with a closing parenthesis and a backslash for continuation, then print it.
    - Create and print the second line of the macro, starting with 'do {' and ending with a backslash for continuation.
    - Iterate over each line in `lines`, printing each with proper indentation and a backslash for continuation.
    - Print the closing line of the macro with '} while( 0 )' to ensure the macro behaves like a single statement.
    - Print two newlines to separate this macro from any subsequent content.
- **Output**: The function outputs the formatted macro definition to the file specified by the global `outf` variable.
