# Purpose
This Python script is designed to generate and write out several binary constant tables used for efficient mathematical operations in finite fields, specifically Galois Fields (GF). The script utilizes the `galois` library to perform operations in GF(2^8), which is a common field size used in error correction and cryptographic algorithms. The script constructs a matrix using Galois Field arithmetic and computes its inverse, which is then used to generate various constant tables. These tables are written to binary files in a specified output directory, `constants/`, and are intended for use in applications that require fast arithmetic operations, such as those involving vectorized operations or hardware acceleration.

The script generates three main types of constant tables: GFNI (Galois Field New Instructions) constants, AVX (Advanced Vector Extensions) constants, and generic constants. The GFNI constants are created by applying a specific affine transformation to each byte value, which is then packed into a binary format. The AVX constants are generated using a shuffle index and are written in a format suitable for AVX2 instructions. The generic constants include logarithm and inverse logarithm tables, which facilitate efficient multiplication in the Galois Field by reducing the operation to a series of table lookups and additions. This script is a utility for precomputing these constants, which can then be used in performance-critical applications that leverage Galois Field arithmetic.

### rust\_matrix1
- **Type**: `galois.GFArray`
- **Description**: `rust_matrix1` is a Galois Field array created using the `galois` library, specifically a 2D array of size `total_shreds` by `data_shreds`. Each element in the array is computed as `GF(i)**j`, where `i` ranges from 0 to `total_shreds` and `j` ranges from 0 to `data_shreds`. This array is constructed over the Galois Field GF(2^8).

---
### full\_matrix
- **Type**: `np.ndarray`
- **Description**: The `full_matrix` is a NumPy array that results from the matrix multiplication of a submatrix of `rust_matrix1` and the inverse of another submatrix of `rust_matrix1`. Specifically, it takes the rows from `data_shreds` to the end of `rust_matrix1` and multiplies them by the inverse of the first `data_shreds` rows of `rust_matrix1`. This operation is performed in the context of a Galois Field (GF(2^8)), which is a finite field used for error correction and cryptography.
- **Use**: This variable is used to store the result of a matrix operation that is likely part of a larger process involving error correction or cryptographic transformations.


---
### bytes\_to\_multiply
- **Type**: `range`
- **Description**: The variable `bytes_to_multiply` is a range object that represents a sequence of integers from 0 to 255. This range is used to iterate over all possible byte values in an 8-bit byte, which is typical for operations involving byte-level data manipulation.
- **Use**: This variable is used to generate encoded data for each byte value, which is then written to a binary file as part of a constant table.


---
### encoded
- **Type**: `list`
- **Description**: The `encoded` variable is a list that stores the results of a matrix multiplication operation involving Galois Field elements. It is created by reshaping an array of integers from 0 to 255 into a 256x1 matrix and multiplying it with another matrix derived from a tiled array of integers. This operation is performed using the Galois Field arithmetic provided by the `galois` library.

---
### shuffle\_idx
- **Type**: `np.ndarray`
- **Description**: `shuffle_idx` is a NumPy array created by tiling the sequence of integers from 0 to 15, inclusive, twice along the second axis. This results in a 1x32 array of 32-bit integers, where the sequence 0 to 15 is repeated twice.

It is used to store logarithmic values for elements in a Galois Field (GF) of size 2^8, where each index corresponds to an element in the field, and the value at that index represents the logarithm of the element with respect to a primitive element of the field. The first element is set to -256 to handle the special case of multiplication by zero.
