# Purpose
This C source code file is auto-generated and provides specialized functions for performing Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT) operations on a set of 128 Galois Field elements. The file includes two primary functions: [`fd_reedsol_fft_128_128`](#fd_reedsol_fft_128_128) and [`fd_reedsol_ifft_128_128`](#fd_reedsol_ifft_128_128). These functions are designed to handle arrays of 128 elements, each represented by the `gf_t` type, which is likely a custom type defined elsewhere to represent elements in a Galois Field. The functions perform FFT and IFFT operations, respectively, by utilizing macros `FD_REEDSOL_GENERATE_FFT` and `FD_REEDSOL_GENERATE_IFFT`, which are presumably defined in the included header file `fd_reedsol_fft.h`.

The code is structured to take pointers to `gf_t` elements as input, dereference them to local variables, and then apply the FFT or IFFT transformation. After the transformation, the results are written back to the original memory locations. This approach suggests that the code is intended for use in applications requiring efficient data transformation, such as error correction in data transmission or storage systems. The file is not a standalone executable but rather a component of a larger system, likely part of a library that provides Reed-Solomon error correction capabilities. The functions defined here are not public APIs but are likely intended for internal use within the library, as indicated by the `FD_FN_UNSANITIZED` macro, which suggests a focus on performance over safety checks.
