# Purpose
The provided content is from a Makefile, which is a build automation tool used to manage the build process of software projects. This specific section of the Makefile is using a macro or function call syntax, `$(call add-objs,...)`, to add object files to a target named `fd_reedsol`. Each line specifies a different implementation file, such as `fd_reedsol_ppt_impl_17` or `fd_reedsol_fft_impl_128_0`, which are likely source files that need to be compiled into object files as part of the build process. The purpose of this configuration is to ensure that all specified implementations are included in the build process for the `fd_reedsol` target, which may be a library or executable related to Reed-Solomon error correction or similar functionality.
