# Purpose
The provided C code is a collection of static constant arrays containing hexadecimal values, specifically designed for use in the Poseidon cryptographic hash function, tailored for the BN254 elliptic curve. These arrays, such as `fd_poseidon_ark_w` and `fd_poseidon_mds_w`, where `w` represents the width of the Poseidon permutation, are crucial for defining the round constants and Maximum Distance Separable (MDS) matrices, which are essential components in the Poseidon permutation process. The constants are represented in Montgomery form to optimize modular arithmetic operations, a common requirement in cryptographic computations. This code is not a standalone executable but rather a part of a larger cryptographic library, providing the necessary parameters for implementing the Poseidon hash function, which is particularly useful in zero-knowledge proofs and other cryptographic protocols. The arrays are intended for internal use within the library, facilitating secure and efficient hashing operations without directly exposing public APIs or external interfaces.
