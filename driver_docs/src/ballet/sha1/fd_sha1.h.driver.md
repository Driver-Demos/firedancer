# Purpose
This code is a C header file that declares a function for computing the SHA-1 hash of a given input. The function [`fd_sha1_hash`](#fd_sha1_hash) takes three parameters: a pointer to the input data, the length of the data, and a buffer to store the resulting hash. The hash buffer must be at least 20 bytes long, as the SHA-1 algorithm produces a 160-bit (20-byte) hash. The function returns a pointer to the output buffer containing the hash. This header file is likely part of a larger library or application, as indicated by the inclusion of another header file, `fd_ballet_base.h`, suggesting a modular design.

### fd\_sha1\_hash
- **Type**: `function pointer`
- **Description**: The `fd_sha1_hash` is a function that computes the SHA1 hash of the input data provided and writes the result into the specified hash buffer. The function requires the input data, its length, and a buffer to store the resulting hash.
- **Use**: This function is used to generate a SHA1 hash from given data and store it in a provided buffer.

### fd\_sha1\_hash<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_sha1_hash}} -->
Compute the SHA1 hash of the input data.
- **Description**: Use this function to compute the SHA1 hash of a given data buffer. It processes the input data and writes the resulting 20-byte hash into the provided output buffer. Ensure that the output buffer is at least 20 bytes in size to accommodate the hash. This function is useful for generating a fixed-size hash from variable-length data, which can be used for data integrity checks or cryptographic purposes.
- **Inputs**:
    - `data`: A pointer to the input data buffer to be hashed. The buffer must be valid and non-null, and the function will read data_len bytes from it.
    - `data_len`: The length of the input data in bytes. It must accurately represent the number of bytes in the data buffer.
    - `hash`: A pointer to the output buffer where the computed SHA1 hash will be stored. The buffer must be at least 20 bytes long, and the caller retains ownership.
- **Output**: Returns a pointer to the output buffer containing the 20-byte SHA1 hash.
