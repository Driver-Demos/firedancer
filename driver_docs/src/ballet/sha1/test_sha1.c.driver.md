# Purpose
This C source code file is an executable program designed to test the functionality of the SHA-1 hashing algorithm. It includes the necessary headers, such as "fd_sha1.h", which likely contains the implementation or interface for the SHA-1 hashing function. The program initializes by calling `fd_boot`, which is presumably a setup function for the environment or framework being used. It then defines a set of input strings and their corresponding expected SHA-1 hash outputs. The main functionality of the program is a loop that iterates over each input string, computes its SHA-1 hash using the `fd_sha1_hash` function, and then compares the computed hash against the expected output. The comparison is done by converting the hash to a hexadecimal string and using `FD_TEST` to assert that the computed and expected hashes match. If all tests pass, the program logs a "pass" message and gracefully exits using `fd_halt`.

The code provides a narrow functionality focused on validating the correctness of the SHA-1 hashing implementation. It does not define public APIs or external interfaces but rather serves as a self-contained test suite for the SHA-1 algorithm. The use of `fd_cstr_printf_check` and `fd_uint_bswap` suggests that the program is part of a larger framework or library, possibly providing utilities for string formatting and byte order manipulation. The inclusion of `fd_ballet.h` indicates that this file might be part of a broader collection of cryptographic or data processing utilities. Overall, the file is a specialized test harness ensuring the integrity and correctness of the SHA-1 hash function within its intended application context.

# Functions

---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function initializes the environment, computes SHA-1 hashes for a set of predefined input strings, and verifies the computed hashes against expected outputs.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The count of command-line arguments passed to the program.
    - `argv`: An array of strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Call `fd_boot` to initialize the environment with command-line arguments.
    - Define arrays `inputs` and `outputs` containing test strings and their expected SHA-1 hash results, respectively.
    - Iterate over each input string, compute its SHA-1 hash using [`fd_sha1_hash`](fd_sha1.c.driver.md#fd_sha1_hash), and store the result in `digest`.
    - Convert the `digest` to a hexadecimal string `hexdigest` using `fd_cstr_printf_check`.
    - Verify that `hexdigest` matches the expected hash in `outputs` using `FD_TEST` and `strcmp`.
    - Log a success message with `FD_LOG_NOTICE` if all tests pass.
    - Call `fd_halt` to clean up and terminate the program.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer value of 0, indicating successful execution.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`fd_sha1_hash`](fd_sha1.c.driver.md#fd_sha1_hash)
