# Purpose
The file is a Makefile snippet used for building and testing components in a software project. It defines build rules by adding header files (`fd_sha1.h`) and object files (`fd_sha1`, `fd_ballet`) to the build process. It also specifies the creation and execution of a unit test named `test_sha1`, which depends on the `fd_ballet` and `fd_util` components.
