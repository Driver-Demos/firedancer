# Purpose
This C source code file is designed to test the functionality of UTF-8 string verification. It includes a main function that executes a series of tests to validate the correctness of UTF-8 encoding using predefined test vectors. The file defines a structure, `fd_utf8_test_vector`, which holds test cases consisting of an input string, its size, and the expected result of the verification. The test vectors are derived from a Rust language test suite, ensuring a comprehensive set of scenarios for UTF-8 validation. The main function iterates over these test vectors, using the `fd_utf8_verify` function to check if the input strings are valid UTF-8 sequences and comparing the results against expected outcomes.

The code also includes additional tests to ensure robustness, such as checking combinations of single glyphs and preventing out-of-bounds reads. It uses assertions to verify that the `fd_utf8_verify` function behaves correctly under various conditions, including edge cases like null bytes within strings and invalid UTF-8 sequences. The file is structured as an executable C program, with the main function serving as the entry point. It does not define public APIs or external interfaces but rather focuses on internal testing of UTF-8 verification logic, likely intended to be part of a larger suite of tests for a UTF-8 handling library.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `fd_utf8.h`
- `assert.h`


# Global Variables

---
### \_single\_glyph\_vec
- **Type**: `fd_utf8_test_vector_t const[]`
- **Description**: The `_single_glyph_vec` is a static constant array of `fd_utf8_test_vector_t` structures, each containing a UTF-8 encoded string, its size, and an expected result indicating whether the string is valid UTF-8. This array is used to test the validity of single UTF-8 glyphs.
- **Use**: This variable is used in the main function to verify the correctness of UTF-8 encoding by iterating over each test vector and checking if the `fd_utf8_verify` function returns the expected result.


# Data Structures

---
### fd\_utf8\_test\_vector
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `input`: A pointer to a constant character array representing the UTF-8 encoded input string.
    - `sz`: An unsigned integer representing the size of the input string.
    - `result`: An integer indicating the expected result of UTF-8 verification (1 for valid, 0 for invalid).
- **Description**: The `fd_utf8_test_vector` structure is designed to hold test data for verifying UTF-8 encoded strings. It contains a pointer to the input string, the size of the string, and the expected result of a UTF-8 verification function. This structure is used to facilitate testing of UTF-8 validation logic by providing a set of predefined test cases with known outcomes.

### fd\_utf8\_test\_vector\_t
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `input`: A pointer to a constant character array representing the UTF-8 encoded input string.
    - `sz`: An unsigned integer representing the size of the input string.
    - `result`: An integer indicating the expected result of UTF-8 verification for the input string.
- **Description**: The `fd_utf8_test_vector_t` structure is designed to hold test vectors for UTF-8 validation. It contains a pointer to a UTF-8 encoded input string, the size of this string, and an expected result indicating whether the string is valid UTF-8. This structure is used to facilitate testing of UTF-8 verification functions by providing known inputs and expected outcomes.


# Functions

---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function tests the UTF-8 verification logic using various test vectors and scenarios to ensure correct behavior.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments passed to the program.
    - `argv`: An array of strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function begins by calling `fd_boot` to initialize the environment with the command-line arguments.
    - It iterates over `_single_glyph_vec` to test each single glyph input using [`fd_utf8_verify`](fd_utf8.c.driver.md#fd_utf8_verify) and checks if the result matches the expected outcome.
    - For each glyph, it tests smaller sizes and inserts a null byte to ensure [`fd_utf8_verify`](fd_utf8.c.driver.md#fd_utf8_verify) returns -1 for invalid inputs.
    - It performs a nested loop over `_single_glyph_vec` to test all combinations of two glyphs, verifying the combined result using [`fd_utf8_verify`](fd_utf8.c.driver.md#fd_utf8_verify).
    - A loop iterates over all possible single-byte values to check for out-of-bounds reads, ensuring [`fd_utf8_verify`](fd_utf8.c.driver.md#fd_utf8_verify) returns 0 or 1.
    - An explicit test checks if a string with a null byte in the middle is valid UTF-8.
    - Additional tests verify that certain out-of-bounds byte sequences are correctly identified as invalid UTF-8.
    - The function logs a notice of success and calls `fd_halt` before returning 0.
- **Output**: The function returns 0, indicating successful execution after performing all tests.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`fd_utf8_verify`](fd_utf8.c.driver.md#fd_utf8_verify)
