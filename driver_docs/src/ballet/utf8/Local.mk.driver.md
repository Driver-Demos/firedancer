# Purpose
The file is a Makefile snippet used for building and testing a software component. It specifies the inclusion of the header file `fd_utf8.h`, adds object files `fd_utf8` and `fd_ballet` to the build process, defines a unit test named `test_utf8` that depends on `fd_ballet` and `fd_util`, and executes the `test_utf8` unit test.
