# Purpose
This C source code file implements a Merkle tree structure specifically designed to handle a fixed number of nodes, as indicated by the `fd_wbmtree32_t` type. The primary functionality of this code is to initialize, append to, and finalize a Merkle tree, which is a cryptographic data structure used to verify the integrity and consistency of data. The code provides functions to initialize the tree ([`fd_wbmtree32_init`](#fd_wbmtree32_init)), append leaves to the tree ([`fd_wbmtree32_append`](#fd_wbmtree32_append)), and finalize the tree to produce a root hash ([`fd_wbmtree32_fini`](#fd_wbmtree32_fini)). These functions ensure that the tree is correctly aligned in memory and that the data is processed using SHA-256 hashing, a standard cryptographic hash function.

The code is structured to handle memory alignment and footprint calculations, ensuring efficient memory usage and alignment for the Merkle tree operations. The [`fd_wbmtree32_align`](#fd_wbmtree32_align) and [`fd_wbmtree32_footprint`](#fd_wbmtree32_footprint) functions provide utility for determining the necessary alignment and memory size for a given number of leaves. The implementation uses batch processing for SHA-256 hashing, which is initialized, used, and finalized within the append and finalize functions. This code is likely part of a larger library or system that requires cryptographic verification of data, and it provides a focused, narrow functionality centered around the creation and management of a Merkle tree.

# Functions

### fd\_wbmtree32\_init<!-- {{#callable:fd_wbmtree32_init}} -->
The `fd_wbmtree32_init` function initializes a 32-bit wide binary Merkle tree structure in a given memory region, setting up its initial state and preparing it for use.
- **Inputs**:
    - `mem`: A pointer to the memory region where the Merkle tree structure will be initialized.
    - `leaf_cnt`: The maximum number of leaves that the Merkle tree can accommodate.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if the `mem` pointer is NULL; if so, log a warning and return NULL.
    - Check if the `mem` pointer is properly aligned according to [`fd_wbmtree32_align`](#fd_wbmtree32_align); if not, log a warning and return NULL.
    - Clear the memory region using `fd_memset` to zero out the space required for the Merkle tree structure, as determined by [`fd_wbmtree32_footprint`](#fd_wbmtree32_footprint).
    - Cast the `mem` pointer to a `fd_wbmtree32_t` pointer and store it in `hdr`.
    - Set the `leaf_cnt_max` field of `hdr` to the provided `leaf_cnt` value.
    - Initialize the `leaf_cnt` field of `hdr` to 0, indicating that the tree currently has no leaves.
    - Initialize the SHA-256 batch processing context within `hdr` using `fd_sha256_batch_init`.
    - Return the `mem` pointer, now cast to a `fd_wbmtree32_t` pointer, indicating successful initialization.
- **Output**: A pointer to the initialized `fd_wbmtree32_t` structure, or NULL if initialization fails due to invalid input or misalignment.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`fd_wbmtree32_align`](#fd_wbmtree32_align)
    - [`fd_wbmtree32_footprint`](#fd_wbmtree32_footprint)

### fd\_wbmtree32\_append<!-- {{#callable:fd_wbmtree32_append}} -->
The `fd_wbmtree32_append` function appends a specified number of leaf nodes to a 32-bit wide Merkle tree, updating the tree's state and hash values accordingly.
- **Inputs**:
    - `bmt`: A pointer to the `fd_wbmtree32_t` structure representing the Merkle tree to which leaves are being appended.
    - `leaf`: A pointer to the first `fd_wbmtree32_leaf_t` structure in an array of leaves to be appended to the Merkle tree.
    - `leaf_cnt`: The number of leaf nodes to append to the Merkle tree.
    - `mbuf`: A buffer used to temporarily store data for hashing operations.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if the total number of leaves after appending will not exceed the maximum allowed (`bmt->leaf_cnt_max`).
    - Initialize a pointer `n` to the current position in the tree's data array where new nodes will be added.
    - Iterate over each leaf to be appended, performing the following steps:
    - Set the first byte of `mbuf` to 0, indicating the start of a new hash input.
    - Copy the leaf's data into `mbuf` starting from the second byte.
    - Add the data in `mbuf` to the SHA-256 batch process, storing the resulting hash in the appropriate position in the node's hash array.
    - Advance the `mbuf` pointer by the size of the leaf data plus one, and move to the next node and leaf.
    - Finalize the SHA-256 batch process to complete the hashing of the appended leaves.
    - Update the tree's leaf count to reflect the newly appended leaves.
    - Perform a final check to ensure the number of leaves does not exceed the maximum allowed.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it modifies the state of the Merkle tree structure `bmt` by appending new leaves and updating hash values.

### fd\_wbmtree32\_fini<!-- {{#callable:fd_wbmtree32_fini}} -->
The `fd_wbmtree32_fini` function finalizes a 32-bit wide binary Merkle tree by reducing it to a single root hash.
- **Inputs**:
    - `bmt`: A pointer to an `fd_wbmtree32_t` structure representing the Merkle tree to be finalized.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function begins by asserting that the current leaf count does not exceed the maximum allowed leaf count.
    - It initializes two pointers, `this` and `that`, to manage the current and next level of nodes in the tree.
    - A while loop runs as long as there is more than one leaf in the tree, indicating that the tree is not yet reduced to a single root hash.
    - If the number of leaves is odd, the last hash is duplicated to make the number of leaves even.
    - For each pair of leaves, a SHA-256 hash is computed and stored in the next level of the tree.
    - The SHA-256 batch is finalized, and the leaf count is halved to reflect the reduction in tree height.
    - The SHA-256 batch is re-initialized for the next iteration.
    - The `this` and `that` pointers are swapped to prepare for the next level of reduction.
    - The function returns a pointer to the root hash of the finalized tree.
- **Output**: A pointer to the root hash of the finalized Merkle tree.

### fd\_wbmtree32\_align<!-- {{#callable:fd_wbmtree32_align}} -->
The `fd_wbmtree32_align` function returns the alignment requirement of the `fd_wbmtree32_t` data structure.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function calls the `alignof` operator on the `fd_wbmtree32_t` type to determine its alignment requirement.
    - The function returns the result of the `alignof` operation.
- **Output**: The function outputs an `ulong` value representing the alignment requirement of the `fd_wbmtree32_t` type.


---
### fd\_wbmtree32\_footprint<!-- {{#callable:fd_wbmtree32_footprint}} -->
The `fd_wbmtree32_footprint` function calculates the memory footprint required for a Merkle tree structure based on the number of leaf nodes.
- **Inputs**:
    - `leaf_cnt`: The number of leaf nodes for which the memory footprint is to be calculated.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if the number of leaf nodes (`leaf_cnt`) is odd, and if so, increment it to make it even.
    - Calculate the total memory footprint by adding the size of the `fd_wbmtree32_t` structure and the size of `fd_wbmtree32_node_t` multiplied by the adjusted number of leaf nodes plus half of that number.
    - Return the calculated memory footprint.
- **Output**: The function returns an unsigned long integer representing the total memory footprint required for the Merkle tree structure.
