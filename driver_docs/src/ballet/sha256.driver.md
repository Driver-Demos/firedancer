## Folders
- **[cavp](sha256/cavp.driver.md)**: The `cavp` folder in the `firedancer` codebase contains test vector files for SHA-256 Monte Carlo and short message hashing, providing detailed information on message digests and iterations.

## Files
- **[fd_sha256.c](sha256/fd_sha256.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_sha256.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase provides an implementation of the SHA-256 hashing algorithm, including functions for initializing, appending data, finalizing, and computing the hash in both incremental and non-incremental modes.
- **[fd_sha256.h](sha256/fd_sha256.h.driver.md)**: The `fd_sha256.h` file in the `firedancer` codebase provides APIs for SHA-256 hashing, including functions for initializing, appending data to, and finalizing SHA-256 hash calculations, as well as batch processing capabilities with different implementations based on available hardware acceleration.
- **[fd_sha256_batch_avx.c](sha256/fd_sha256_batch_avx.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_sha256_batch_avx.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase implements a batched SHA-256 hashing function optimized for AVX (Advanced Vector Extensions) to process multiple data blocks simultaneously, with specific optimizations for handling message tails and state updates.
- **[fd_sha256_batch_avx512.c](sha256/fd_sha256_batch_avx512.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_sha256_batch_avx512.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase implements a batch processing function for SHA-256 hashing using AVX-512 SIMD instructions, with a fallback to AVX for smaller batch sizes.
- **[fd_sha256_core_shaext.S](sha256/fd_sha256_core_shaext.S.driver.md)**: The `fd_sha256_core_shaext.S` file in the `firedancer` codebase contains an optimized assembly implementation of the SHA-256 hash function using SHA extensions and modern x86_64 architecture features, derived and modified from OpenSSL's autogenerated code.
- **[fd_sha256_test_vector.c](sha256/fd_sha256_test_vector.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_sha256_test_vector.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase contains a set of predefined SHA-256 test vectors, which were generated using OpenSSL on various randomly generated text strings.
- **[fuzz_sha256.c](sha256/fuzz_sha256.c.driver.md)**: The `fuzz_sha256.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase implements a fuzz testing framework for the SHA-256 hashing algorithm, supporting both single message and batch hashing operations.
- **[Local.mk](sha256/Local.mk.driver.md)**: The `Local.mk` file in the `firedancer` codebase specifies the build configuration for the SHA-256 implementation, including headers, object files, assembly files, unit tests, and conditional compilation based on available hardware features like SHANI, AVX, and AVX512.
- **[test_sha256.c](sha256/test_sha256.c.driver.md)**: The `test_sha256.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase contains a comprehensive suite of tests and benchmarks for verifying the correctness and performance of SHA-256 hashing implementations, including single-shot, incremental, and batched hashing.
