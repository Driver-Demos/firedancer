# Purpose
This C source code file is designed to test the correctness, mutation resilience, and performance of transaction parsing functions within a blockchain or distributed ledger context. The file imports several binary transaction fixtures, each representing different transaction scenarios, such as transactions that never landed on the blockchain, those that did, and others crafted to test edge cases like maximum size or invalid instructions. The code defines a series of tests that parse these transactions, verify their structure and contents, and ensure that the parsing logic correctly handles various transaction attributes, such as signatures, account addresses, and instructions.

The file includes functions that perform detailed validation of parsed transactions, checking for expected values and ensuring that the parsing logic is robust against mutations and truncations. It also measures the performance of the parsing function by timing how long it takes to parse a large number of transactions. The code is structured to be executed as a standalone program, with a [`main`](#main) function that initializes the environment, runs the tests, and logs the results. This file is not intended to be a library or header file for external use but rather a comprehensive test suite for validating the transaction parsing capabilities of the system.
