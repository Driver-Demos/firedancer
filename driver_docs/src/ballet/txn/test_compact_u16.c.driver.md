# Purpose
This C source code file is a test suite designed to validate the functionality of encoding and decoding functions for compact 16-bit unsigned integers. The code is structured to ensure that the decoding function, `fd_cu16_dec`, is the exact inverse of the encoding function, `fd_cu16_enc`, within its proper domain. The test suite checks the injective and surjective properties of the decoding function, ensuring that it correctly maps encoded byte patterns back to their original 16-bit unsigned integer values and rejects any patterns outside its domain. The code uses a random number generator to initialize the testing environment and logs progress and results to provide feedback on the test execution.

The file includes several key components: a main function that orchestrates the testing process, arrays to store encoded data and results, and loops that iterate over possible byte patterns to verify the decoding function's behavior. The test suite is comprehensive, covering all possible 16-bit unsigned integer values and additional patterns to ensure robustness. The code is intended to be executed as a standalone program, as indicated by the presence of the [`main`](#main) function, and it does not define any public APIs or external interfaces. The focus is on internal validation of the encoding and decoding logic, making it a critical component for ensuring data integrity in systems that rely on compact 16-bit integer representations.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `fd_compact_u16.h`


# Global Variables

---
### compact\_u16
- **Type**: `uchar`
- **Description**: The `compact_u16` is a two-dimensional array of unsigned characters, with dimensions defined by `TEST_U16_MAX` and `TEST_U16_BUF_SZ`. It is used to store compact representations of 16-bit unsigned integers.
- **Use**: This variable is used to hold the encoded form of 16-bit unsigned integers for testing the decoding function `fd_cu16_dec`.


---
### found
- **Type**: `uchar array`
- **Description**: The `found` variable is a global array of unsigned characters with a size defined by `TEST_U16_MAX`. It is used to track which ushort values have been successfully decoded by the `fd_cu16_dec` function.
- **Use**: This variable is used to ensure that each ushort value is decoded exactly once, verifying the injective property of the decoding function.


---
### encoded\_sz
- **Type**: `uchar array`
- **Description**: The `encoded_sz` variable is a global array of unsigned characters with a size defined by `TEST_U16_MAX`, which is slightly larger than the maximum value that can fit in a 16-bit unsigned integer. This array is used to store the encoded sizes of 16-bit unsigned integers after they have been processed by the encoding function `fd_cu16_enc`. Each element in the array corresponds to the encoded size of a specific 16-bit unsigned integer value.
- **Use**: `encoded_sz` is used to store the encoded sizes of 16-bit unsigned integers for later verification against the decoding function's output.


# Functions

---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function tests the [`fd_cu16_dec`](fd_compact_u16.h.driver.md#fd_cu16_dec) decoding function to ensure it is the inverse of the encoding function [`fd_cu16_enc`](fd_compact_u16.h.driver.md#fd_cu16_enc), verifying its injective and surjective properties within its domain.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments passed to the program.
    - `argv`: An array of strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize the program environment with `fd_boot` and set up a random number generator.
    - Iterate over all possible ushort values to encode them using [`fd_cu16_enc`](fd_compact_u16.h.driver.md#fd_cu16_enc) and store the encoded size.
    - For each possible buffer size, iterate over all possible byte patterns to test the decoding function [`fd_cu16_dec`](fd_compact_u16.h.driver.md#fd_cu16_dec).
    - Log progress for the largest buffer size when certain conditions are met.
    - For each byte pattern, decode it and verify the consumed size matches the encoded size if decoding is successful.
    - Check injective property by ensuring no duplicate decoding results and that the decoded buffer matches the encoded buffer.
    - Mark the decoded result as found if it meets the injective criteria.
    - Verify surjective property by ensuring all expected integers are found and no unexpected integers are found.
    - Clean up the random number generator and log a success message before halting the program.
- **Output**: The function returns 0, indicating successful execution after verifying the decoding function's properties.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`fd_cu16_enc`](fd_compact_u16.h.driver.md#fd_cu16_enc)
    - [`fd_cu16_dec`](fd_compact_u16.h.driver.md#fd_cu16_dec)
