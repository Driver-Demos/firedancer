# Purpose
The file is a Makefile script used for automating the build and test processes in a software project. It defines rules to add header files and object files, create unit tests, and conditionally create a fuzz test if the `FD_HAS_HOSTED` variable is set. Additionally, it specifies commands to run the defined unit tests, ensuring the software components are correctly built and tested.
