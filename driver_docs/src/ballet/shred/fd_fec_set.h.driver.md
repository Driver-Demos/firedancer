# Purpose
This C header file defines structures and macros related to Forward Error Correction (FEC) sets, which are used in data transmission systems to ensure data integrity and reliability. It includes the "fd_reedsol.h" header, indicating reliance on Reed-Solomon error correction techniques. The file defines two sets, `d_rcvd` and `p_rcvd`, for managing received data and parity shreds, respectively, with maximum sizes defined by `FD_REEDSOL_DATA_SHREDS_MAX` and `FD_REEDSOL_PARITY_SHREDS_MAX`. The `fd_fec_set` structure encapsulates the counts and arrays for data and parity shreds, which are essential for constructing and validating FEC sets in transmission and reception processes. This header is likely part of a larger system that handles data packet transmission using Merkle shreds, where complete FEC sets must be constructed or received to ensure data integrity.

# Data Structures

### fd\_shred\_t
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `fd_shred_t`: A typedef for the struct fd_shred, which is a forward declaration of a data structure used in the context of FEC (Forward Error Correction) sets.
- **Description**: The fd_shred_t is a typedef for a struct named fd_shred, which is forward-declared in the provided code. This indicates that fd_shred_t is a custom data type used within the context of FEC sets, which are related to the transmission and reception of data packets using Merkle shreds. The actual definition of the struct fd_shred is not provided in the code, suggesting that it is defined elsewhere, and it plays a role in the handling of data and parity shreds within FEC sets.

### fd\_fec\_set
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `data_shred_cnt`: Stores the count of data shreds in the FEC set.
    - `parity_shred_cnt`: Stores the count of parity shreds in the FEC set.
    - `data_shred_rcvd`: An array indicating which data shreds have been received.
    - `parity_shred_rcvd`: An array indicating which parity shreds have been received.
    - `data_shreds`: An array of pointers to the data shreds.
    - `parity_shreds`: An array of pointers to the parity shreds.
- **Description**: The `fd_fec_set` structure is used to manage a Forward Error Correction (FEC) set, which is a collection of data and parity shreds used in error correction and data recovery processes. It includes counters for the number of data and parity shreds, arrays to track received shreds, and arrays of pointers to the actual data and parity shreds. This structure is crucial for constructing and validating FEC sets, which are necessary for reliable data transmission and reception in systems utilizing Merkle shreds.

### fd\_fec\_set\_t
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `data_shred_cnt`: Stores the count of data shreds in the FEC set.
    - `parity_shred_cnt`: Stores the count of parity shreds in the FEC set.
    - `data_shred_rcvd`: An array indicating which data shreds have been received.
    - `parity_shred_rcvd`: An array indicating which parity shreds have been received.
    - `data_shreds`: An array of pointers to the data shreds.
    - `parity_shreds`: An array of pointers to the parity shreds.
- **Description**: The `fd_fec_set_t` structure represents a Forward Error Correction (FEC) set used in data transmission, particularly with Merkle shreds. It contains counters for the number of data and parity shreds, arrays to track received shreds, and arrays of pointers to the actual data and parity shreds. This structure is crucial for managing the transmission and validation of data packets, as the entire FEC set must be constructed or received before any data can be sent or validated.
