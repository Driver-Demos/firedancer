# Purpose
This C source code file is an executable program designed to process and verify data shreds from binary archives. The program imports binary data from specified files using the `FD_IMPORT_BINARY` macro, which suggests that these files contain serialized data shreds. The main functionality of the program revolves around reading these shreds from the archives, deserializing them, and then processing them using a deshredder mechanism. The deshredder, represented by the `fd_deshredder_t` structure, is initialized and used to concatenate and verify the integrity of the shreds. The program performs this operation for multiple sets of shreds, as indicated by the different versions and slots (e.g., "v13 slot 0", "v14 slot 0", "v14 slot 1").

The code is structured to ensure that the shreds are read correctly and that the deserialized data matches expected values, as evidenced by the various `FD_TEST` assertions. These assertions check the size of the defragmented batch, the number of shreds, and the integrity of the deshredded content against known values. The program logs its progress and results using `FD_LOG_NOTICE`, providing a trace of its operations. This file is a standalone executable, as indicated by the presence of the [`main`](#main) function, and it does not define any public APIs or external interfaces. Its primary purpose is to validate the deserialization and integrity of data shreds from binary archives, likely as part of a larger data processing or validation pipeline.

# Functions

---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function initializes and processes shred data from multiple archive files, verifying the integrity and size of the deserialized batches.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments.
    - `argv`: An array of command-line argument strings.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize the application with `fd_boot` using command-line arguments.
    - Open the first archive file `localnet_shreds_0` for reading and initialize the archive reader.
    - Initialize a deshredder with an empty list of shreds and a buffer for deserialized data.
    - Iterate over each shred in the archive, reading and parsing it, then feeding it to the deshredder one by one.
    - Verify that the archive was fully consumed and check the size and content of the deserialized batch against expected values.
    - Repeat the process for two more archive files: `localnet_v14_shreds_0` and `localnet_v14_shreds_1`.
    - Log progress and results at various stages.
    - Terminate the application with `fd_halt` and return 0.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer value of 0, indicating successful execution.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`fd_shred_parse`](fd_shred.c.driver.md#fd_shred_parse)
