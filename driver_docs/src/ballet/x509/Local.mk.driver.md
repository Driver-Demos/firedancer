# Purpose
This file is a Makefile script used for building and testing components in a software project. It adds header files and object files to the build process, specifically `fd_x509_mock.h` and `fd_x509_mock` with `fd_ballet`. It also defines and executes a unit test named `test_x509`, which depends on `fd_ballet` and `fd_util` libraries.
