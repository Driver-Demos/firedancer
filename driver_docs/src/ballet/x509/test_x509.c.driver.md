# Purpose
This C source code file is a test program designed to validate the functionality of a mock X.509 certificate handling library. The program includes the header file `fd_x509_mock.h`, which likely contains the declarations for functions related to mock X.509 certificate operations, and `fd_util.h`, which might provide utility functions such as logging and random number generation. The main function initializes a random number generator and performs a series of tests on mock X.509 certificates. It tests the extraction of public keys from predefined certificate data and verifies the integrity of the extraction process by comparing the extracted keys with expected values.

The program also generates random public keys, creates mock certificates using these keys, and verifies that the public key extraction from these certificates is consistent. Additionally, it tests the robustness of the extraction process by intentionally corrupting parts of the certificate data and ensuring that the extraction fails when expected. The use of `FD_TEST` macros suggests a testing framework that checks conditions and likely logs failures. The program concludes by cleaning up resources and logging a success message if all tests pass. This file is primarily focused on testing and validating the mock X.509 certificate functionalities, rather than providing a broad API or library for external use.

# Functions

### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function initializes a random number generator, tests the extraction of public keys from mock X.509 certificates, and verifies the integrity of these certificates under various conditions.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments passed to the program.
    - `argv`: An array of strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize the program environment with `fd_boot` using the command-line arguments.
    - Create and join a random number generator instance.
    - Define two static arrays representing mock X.509 certificates (`cert_v1_1` and `cert_v1_2`).
    - Extract public keys from these certificates using [`fd_x509_mock_pubkey`](fd_x509_mock.c.driver.md#fd_x509_mock_pubkey) and verify their correctness with `FD_TEST`.
    - Test the extraction of public keys from `cert_v1_2` with varying sizes to check for out-of-bounds errors.
    - Run a loop 100,000 times to generate random public keys, create mock certificates, and verify the integrity of the certificates and extracted keys.
    - Within the loop, corrupt random bytes in the certificate and verify that the extraction fails if the corruption affects the template.
    - Delete the random number generator instance and log a success message before halting the program.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer value of 0, indicating successful execution.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`fd_x509_mock_pubkey`](fd_x509_mock.c.driver.md#fd_x509_mock_pubkey)
    - [`fd_x509_mock_cert`](fd_x509_mock.c.driver.md#fd_x509_mock_cert)
