# Purpose
This code is a C header file designed to configure and include the necessary dependencies for working with Protocol Buffers using the nanopb library in a project. It begins with include guards to prevent multiple inclusions and checks if the `pb.h` file has already been included, issuing an error if so, to ensure that only `pb_firedancer.h` is used. The file sets several preprocessor directives: `PB_BUFFER_ONLY`, `PB_FIELD_32BIT`, and `PB_ENABLE_MALLOC`, which configure the nanopb library to use 32-bit fields and enable dynamic memory allocation. Additionally, it includes the `pb.h` file from the nanopb library and a utility header `fd_util.h` from a relative path, suggesting that this file is part of a larger project structure. A TODO comment indicates that custom memory allocation functions using `fd_alloc` need to be implemented, hinting at a planned extension or customization of memory management.
