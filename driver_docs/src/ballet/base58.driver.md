## Files
- **[fd_base58.c](base58/fd_base58.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_base58.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase provides an implementation for encoding and decoding data using the Base58 encoding scheme, with support for AVX optimizations.
- **[fd_base58.h](base58/fd_base58.h.driver.md)**: The `fd_base58.h` file in the `firedancer` codebase provides methods for encoding and decoding 32 and 64 byte binary data to and from base58 strings, suitable for use with Solana account addresses and transaction signatures.
- **[fd_base58_avx.h](base58/fd_base58_avx.h.driver.md)**: The `fd_base58_avx.h` file in the `firedancer` codebase provides AVX2-optimized functions for converting data to and from base58 encoding, including operations for loading, storing, and manipulating vectors, as well as counting leading zeros and packing base58 digits.
- **[fd_base58_tmpl.c](base58/fd_base58_tmpl.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_base58_tmpl.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase provides template functions for encoding and decoding binary data to and from base58, specifically for binary data of lengths 32 or 64 bytes.
- **[fuzz_base58_garbage.c](base58/fuzz_base58_garbage.c.driver.md)**: The `fuzz_base58_garbage.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase implements a fuzzing test for the Base58 decoding functions, ensuring they handle various inputs correctly and safely.
- **[fuzz_base58_roundtrip.c](base58/fuzz_base58_roundtrip.c.driver.md)**: The `fuzz_base58_roundtrip.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase implements a fuzz testing routine to verify the correctness of Base58 encoding and decoding functions for data of specific sizes.
- **[Local.mk](base58/Local.mk.driver.md)**: The `Local.mk` file in the `firedancer` codebase specifies the build configuration for the `base58` module, including headers, object files, unit tests, and conditional fuzz tests.
- **[test_base58.c](base58/test_base58.c.driver.md)**: The `test_base58.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase contains tests for encoding and decoding functions that convert data to and from base58 format, including reference implementations and performance tests for both 256-bit and 512-bit conversions, with additional tests for AVX optimizations if available.
