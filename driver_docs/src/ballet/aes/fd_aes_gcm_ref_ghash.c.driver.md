# Purpose
The provided C source code file, `fd_aes_gcm_ref.c`, is a specialized implementation of the Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) for AES encryption, specifically focusing on a 4-bit table-driven approach. This file is part of a cryptographic library, originally derived from the OpenSSL project, and it implements functions for initializing and performing GCM operations using a 4-bit lookup table. The primary functions include [`fd_gcm_init_4bit`](#fd_gcm_init_4bit), which initializes a hash table for GCM operations, [`fd_gcm_gmult_4bit`](#fd_gcm_gmult_4bit), which performs a multiplication operation in the Galois field, and [`fd_gcm_ghash_4bit`](#fd_gcm_ghash_4bit), which computes a hash over a data stream. These functions are designed to optimize the balance between security and performance, avoiding larger table sizes that could lead to cache-timing attacks and excessive memory usage.

The code is not intended to be a standalone executable but rather a component of a larger cryptographic library, as indicated by its inclusion of the header file `fd_aes_gcm.h`. It does not define public APIs or external interfaces directly but provides internal implementations that are likely used by higher-level functions within the library. The file includes detailed comments explaining the rationale behind the 4-bit implementation choice, emphasizing security considerations and performance trade-offs. The use of macros and static data structures, such as `rem_4bit`, further supports the efficient execution of cryptographic operations while maintaining a focus on minimizing vulnerabilities to side-channel attacks.
# Imports and Dependencies

- `fd_aes_gcm.h`


# Global Variables

---
### rem\_4bit
- **Type**: `static const ulong[16]`
- **Description**: The `rem_4bit` variable is a static constant array of 16 unsigned long integers. Each element in the array is the result of a macro `PACK` applied to a hexadecimal value, which shifts the value to the left by a number of bits determined by the size of `ulong`. This array is used in the Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) implementation for cryptographic operations.
- **Use**: The `rem_4bit` array is used to perform bitwise operations in the GCM multiplication and hashing functions to aid in the reduction of intermediate values during cryptographic computations.


# Functions

---
### fd\_gcm\_init\_4bit<!-- {{#callable:fd_gcm_init_4bit}} -->
The `fd_gcm_init_4bit` function initializes a 16-entry lookup table for Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) encryption using a 4-bit table-driven approach.
- **Inputs**:
    - `Htable`: An array of 16 `fd_gcm128_t` structures that will be initialized to store precomputed values for GCM operations.
    - `H`: A constant array of two unsigned long integers representing the initial hash subkey used for GCM operations.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize the first entry of `Htable` to zero.
    - Set the `V` variable with the values from the `H` array.
    - Assign `V` to the 8th entry of `Htable`.
    - Iteratively reduce `V` by one bit using the `REDUCE1BIT` macro and assign it to the 4th, 2nd, and 1st entries of `Htable`.
    - Compute the XOR of `V` with previous entries to fill the 3rd, 5th, 6th, and 7th entries of `Htable`.
    - Reassign `V` to the 8th entry of `Htable` and compute the XOR with previous entries to fill the 9th to 15th entries of `Htable`.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it modifies the `Htable` array in place to store precomputed values for GCM operations.

### fd\_gcm\_gmult\_4bit<!-- {{#callable:fd_gcm_gmult_4bit}} -->
The `fd_gcm_gmult_4bit` function performs a 4-bit Galois field multiplication on a 128-bit input using a precomputed hash table.
- **Inputs**:
    - `Xi`: An array of two unsigned long integers representing a 128-bit input value to be multiplied.
    - `Htable`: A constant array of 16 `fd_gcm128_t` structures, each containing two unsigned long integers, representing the precomputed hash table for multiplication.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize a `fd_gcm128_t` structure `Z` to store intermediate results.
    - Extract the least significant 4 bits (`nlo`) and the next 4 bits (`nhi`) from the last byte of `Xi`.
    - Set `Z` to the corresponding entry in `Htable` indexed by `nlo`.
    - Enter a loop that iterates 16 times, decrementing `cnt` each time.
    - In each iteration, calculate the remainder of `Z.lo` modulo 16 and update `Z` by shifting and XORing with `rem_4bit` and `Htable` entries.
    - Break the loop when `cnt` is less than 0.
    - Extract `nlo` and `nhi` from the current byte of `Xi` and repeat the update process for `Z`.
    - After the loop, swap the byte order of `Z.hi` and `Z.lo` and store them back into `Xi`.
- **Output**: The function modifies the `Xi` array in place, storing the result of the Galois field multiplication in the same array.

### fd\_gcm\_ghash\_4bit<!-- {{#callable:fd_gcm_ghash_4bit}} -->
The `fd_gcm_ghash_4bit` function performs a 4-bit Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) hash operation on a block of data using a precomputed hash table.
- **Inputs**:
    - `Xi`: An array of two unsigned long integers representing the current hash state.
    - `Htable`: A constant array of 16 `fd_gcm128_t` structures representing the precomputed hash table for GCM.
    - `inp`: A pointer to the input data (unsigned char array) to be hashed.
    - `len`: The length of the input data in bytes, which should be a multiple of 16.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize a temporary variable `Z` and loop counter `cnt`.
    - Enter a do-while loop that continues as long as `len` is greater than 0.
    - Inside the loop, set `cnt` to 15 and calculate `nlo` and `nhi` from the last byte of `Xi` XORed with the last byte of `inp`.
    - Initialize `Z` using the precomputed values from `Htable` indexed by `nlo`.
    - Enter a while loop that continues until `cnt` is less than 0.
    - In each iteration of the while loop, perform a series of bitwise operations and XORs to update `Z` using `rem_4bit` and `Htable`.
    - Decrement `cnt` and repeat the process for the next byte of `Xi` and `inp`.
    - After exiting the while loop, update `Xi` with the byte-swapped values of `Z`.
    - Increment the `inp` pointer by 16 and decrement `len` by 16.
    - Repeat the do-while loop until all input data is processed.
- **Output**: The function updates the `Xi` array with the new hash state after processing the input data.
