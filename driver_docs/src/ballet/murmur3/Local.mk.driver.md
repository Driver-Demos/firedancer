# Purpose
The file is a Makefile snippet used for building and testing components of a software project. It adds the header file `fd_murmur3.h` and object files `fd_murmur3` and `fd_ballet` to the build process, defines a unit test named `test_murmur3` that depends on `fd_ballet` and `fd_util`, and specifies the execution of this unit test.
