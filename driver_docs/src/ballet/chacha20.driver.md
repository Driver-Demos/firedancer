## Files
- **[fd_chacha20.c](chacha20/fd_chacha20.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_chacha20.c` file provides a reference implementation of the ChaCha20 block function, which is not optimized for high performance but can be parallelized using SSE or AVX if needed.
- **[fd_chacha20.h](chacha20/fd_chacha20.h.driver.md)**: The `fd_chacha20.h` file defines constants and a prototype for the ChaCha20 block function, specifying the block and key sizes, within the `firedancer` codebase.
- **[fd_chacha20_avx.c](chacha20/fd_chacha20_avx.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_chacha20_avx.c` file implements a function to refill a ChaCha20 random number generator buffer using AVX SIMD instructions for performance optimization.
- **[fd_chacha20_sse.c](chacha20/fd_chacha20_sse.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_chacha20_sse.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase implements the ChaCha20 block function using SSE (Streaming SIMD Extensions) for optimized cryptographic operations.
- **[fd_chacha20rng.c](chacha20/fd_chacha20rng.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_chacha20rng.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase implements functions for managing and initializing a ChaCha20-based random number generator, including memory alignment, creation, joining, leaving, deletion, and refilling operations.
- **[fd_chacha20rng.h](chacha20/fd_chacha20rng.h.driver.md)**: The `fd_chacha20rng.h` file provides APIs for a ChaCha20-based random number generator used in the Solana protocol, detailing its initialization, memory management, and random number generation methods.
- **[Local.mk](chacha20/Local.mk.driver.md)**: The `Local.mk` file in the `firedancer` codebase specifies the build configuration for the ChaCha20 component, including header and object files, conditional AVX and SSE optimizations, and unit tests.
- **[test_chacha20.c](chacha20/test_chacha20.c.driver.md)**: The `test_chacha20.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase contains functions to test and benchmark the `fd_chacha20_block` function using a test vector from IETF RFC 7539.
- **[test_chacha20rng.c](chacha20/test_chacha20rng.c.driver.md)**: The `test_chacha20rng.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase tests the functionality and performance of the ChaCha20-based random number generator, including initialization, output verification, and benchmarking with and without AVX optimizations.
- **[test_chacha20rng_roll.c](chacha20/test_chacha20rng_roll.c.driver.md)**: The `test_chacha20rng_roll.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase contains tests for the ChaCha20 random number generator, including comparisons with Rust-generated samples and iterated RNG operations, as well as a command-line interface for testing RNG rolls with specified parameters.
