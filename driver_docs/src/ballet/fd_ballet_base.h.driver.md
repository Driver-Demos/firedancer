# Purpose
This C header file, `fd_ballet_base.h`, serves as a configuration and setup file for defining constants and macros related to data alignment and transaction size in a Solana-based application. It defines `FD_TPU_MTU`, which specifies the maximum size of a Solana transaction in its serialized form, excluding network headers. The file also establishes a macro, `FD_ALIGN`, to determine the default memory alignment based on the platform's capabilities, such as AVX512, AVX, or the presence of 128-bit integers. Additionally, it provides a macro, `FD_ALIGNED`, to facilitate the use of compiler-specific alignment attributes. The file includes a placeholder for future interoperability functionality, indicating potential expansion to include more complex operations or definitions.
