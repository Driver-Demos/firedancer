## Files
- **[fd_compact_u16.h](txn/fd_compact_u16.h.driver.md)**: The `fd_compact_u16.h` file declares utility methods for encoding and decoding the compact-u16 format used in Solana transactions, providing functions for reading, validating, and encoding 16-bit unsigned integers in a variable-length format.
- **[fd_txn.h](txn/fd_txn.h.driver.md)**: The `fd_txn.h` file in the `firedancer` codebase defines the structure and functions for handling Solana transactions, including transaction components like instructions, account addresses, and address lookup tables, as well as utilities for parsing and analyzing these transactions.
- **[fd_txn_parse.c](txn/fd_txn_parse.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_txn_parse.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase implements a function to parse Solana transaction payloads, ensuring safety and correctness through a series of checks and validations.
- **[fuzz_txn_parse.c](txn/fuzz_txn_parse.c.driver.md)**: The `fuzz_txn_parse.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase implements a fuzzing test for transaction parsing, ensuring that the transaction data is correctly parsed and meets certain size constraints.
- **[Local.mk](txn/Local.mk.driver.md)**: The `Local.mk` file in the `firedancer` codebase specifies the headers, object files, unit tests, and conditional fuzz tests for the transaction parsing component in the `ballet/txn` directory.
- **[test_compact_u16.c](txn/test_compact_u16.c.driver.md)**: The `test_compact_u16.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase tests the decoding function `fd_cu16_dec` to ensure it is the inverse of the encoding function for 16-bit unsigned integers, verifying its injective and surjective properties within its domain.
- **[test_txn.c](txn/test_txn.c.driver.md)**: The `test_txn.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase contains tests for transaction structures, including account category iteration and validation of transaction size constraints.
- **[test_txn_parse.c](txn/test_txn_parse.c.driver.md)**: The `test_txn_parse.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase contains tests for parsing and validating various transaction binaries, including correctness, mutation, and performance tests, using the `fd_txn_parse` function.
