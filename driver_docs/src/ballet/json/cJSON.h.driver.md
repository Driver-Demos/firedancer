# Purpose
This C header file defines the interface for the cJSON library, which is a lightweight JSON parser and generator written in C. The file provides a comprehensive set of functions and macros for creating, parsing, manipulating, and serializing JSON data structures. It includes definitions for various JSON data types such as objects, arrays, strings, numbers, booleans, and null values, encapsulated within the `cJSON` structure. The library supports both formatted and unformatted JSON output, and it allows for deep copying and comparison of JSON objects. Additionally, the file includes functionality for memory management, enabling users to specify custom memory allocation functions.

The header file is designed to be cross-platform, with specific considerations for Windows and Unix-like systems, including conditional compilation directives to handle symbol visibility and calling conventions. It defines a public API with functions prefixed by `CJSON_PUBLIC`, which ensures the correct export or import of symbols depending on the build configuration. The file also includes versioning information and a set of utility macros to facilitate common operations, such as iterating over JSON arrays or setting values within JSON objects. Overall, this header file serves as a crucial component of the cJSON library, providing a clear and structured interface for developers to interact with JSON data in C applications.

# Data Structures

---
### cJSON
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `next`: Pointer to the next cJSON item in a linked list, used for traversing arrays or objects.
    - `prev`: Pointer to the previous cJSON item in a linked list, used for traversing arrays or objects.
    - `child`: Pointer to the first child of a cJSON item, used for arrays or objects containing other items.
    - `type`: Integer representing the type of the cJSON item, such as string, number, array, or object.
    - `valuestring`: Pointer to a string value if the cJSON item is of type string or raw.
    - `valueint`: Deprecated integer value of the cJSON item, use cJSON_SetNumberValue instead.
    - `valuedouble`: Double value of the cJSON item if it is of type number.
    - `valueulong`: Unsigned long value associated with the cJSON item.
    - `string`: Pointer to the name string of the cJSON item if it is a child or part of an object.
- **Description**: The cJSON structure is a fundamental component of the cJSON library, representing a JSON data item. It is designed to handle various JSON data types, including strings, numbers, arrays, and objects. The structure uses linked list pointers (next, prev) to facilitate navigation through JSON arrays and objects, while the child pointer is used to access nested items within arrays or objects. The type field indicates the specific JSON type of the item, and the structure includes fields for storing string and numeric values. The cJSON structure is versatile, allowing for the creation, manipulation, and traversal of JSON data in C programs.

### cJSON\_Hooks
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `malloc_fn`: A function pointer to a custom memory allocation function.
    - `free_fn`: A function pointer to a custom memory deallocation function.
- **Description**: The `cJSON_Hooks` structure is designed to allow users to specify custom memory management functions for the cJSON library. It contains two function pointers, `malloc_fn` and `free_fn`, which can be set to user-defined functions for allocating and freeing memory, respectively. This is particularly useful for integrating cJSON with custom memory management systems or for ensuring compatibility with different calling conventions, especially on Windows platforms.
