# Purpose
The file is a Makefile snippet used in a build system to manage dependencies. It utilizes the `add-hdrs` and `add-objs` macros to include the `cJSON.h` header file and the `cJSON` and `fd_ballet` object files in the build process. This configuration ensures that these components are correctly compiled and linked during the software build.
