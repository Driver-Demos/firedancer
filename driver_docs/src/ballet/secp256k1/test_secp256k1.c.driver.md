# Purpose
This C source code file is designed to test the functionality and performance of the `fd_secp256k1_recover` function, which is part of a cryptographic library dealing with the secp256k1 elliptic curve. This curve is widely used in blockchain technologies, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, for public key cryptography. The file includes several test cases to verify the correctness of the public key recovery from a given message and signature, using both Solana and Ethereum test vectors. It also includes performance benchmarking to measure the execution speed of the recovery function under different conditions.

The file is structured as an executable C program, with a [`main`](#main) function that initializes a random number generator and calls the [`test_recover`](#test_recover) function. The [`test_recover`](#test_recover) function contains multiple test scenarios, including both successful and failing cases, to ensure the robustness of the `fd_secp256k1_recover` function. Additionally, the file includes a benchmarking section that logs the performance of the recovery function, both in typical and erroneous scenarios. The inclusion of logging and benchmarking indicates a focus on both functional correctness and performance efficiency, making this file a comprehensive test suite for the secp256k1 recovery functionality.

# Functions

### log\_bench<!-- {{#callable:log_bench}} -->
The `log_bench` function logs the performance metrics of a benchmark test, specifically the throughput in KHz per core and the average time per call in nanoseconds.
- **Inputs**:
    - `descr`: A constant character pointer representing the description of the benchmark being logged.
    - `iter`: An unsigned long integer representing the number of iterations performed in the benchmark.
    - `dt`: A long integer representing the total time taken for the benchmark in microseconds.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Calculate the throughput in KHz per core by multiplying 1e6 with the ratio of iterations to time (iter/dt).
    - Calculate the average time per call in nanoseconds by dividing the total time by the number of iterations (dt/iter).
    - Log the description, throughput, and average time per call using the FD_LOG_NOTICE macro.
- **Output**: The function does not return any value; it logs the benchmark results using a logging macro.

### test\_recover<!-- {{#callable:test_recover}} -->
The `test_recover` function tests the correctness and performance of the [`fd_secp256k1_recover`](fd_secp256k1.c.driver.md#fd_secp256k1_recover) function using predefined test cases and benchmarks.
- **Inputs**:
    - `rng`: An unused random number generator pointer, marked as unused with FD_FN_UNUSED.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize expected public key, message, signature, and recovery ID for Solana test cases.
    - Call [`fd_secp256k1_recover`](fd_secp256k1.c.driver.md#fd_secp256k1_recover) and verify the output matches the expected public key using `FD_TEST` and `memcmp`.
    - Repeat the above steps for another Solana test case with different inputs.
    - Initialize expected public key, message, signature, and recovery ID for Ethereum test cases.
    - Call [`fd_secp256k1_recover`](fd_secp256k1.c.driver.md#fd_secp256k1_recover) and verify the output matches the expected public key using `FD_TEST` and `memcmp`.
    - Test signature recovery with a modified message to ensure it returns an incorrect public key.
    - Test signature recovery with a modified signature to ensure it fails and returns NULL.
    - Test invalid recovery IDs to ensure they fail and return NULL without causing a panic.
    - Benchmark the [`fd_secp256k1_recover`](fd_secp256k1.c.driver.md#fd_secp256k1_recover) function with valid inputs and log the performance.
    - Benchmark the [`fd_secp256k1_recover`](fd_secp256k1.c.driver.md#fd_secp256k1_recover) function with invalid signature inputs and log the performance.
- **Output**: The function does not return any value; it performs tests and logs results to verify the correctness and performance of the [`fd_secp256k1_recover`](fd_secp256k1.c.driver.md#fd_secp256k1_recover) function.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`fd_secp256k1_recover`](fd_secp256k1.c.driver.md#fd_secp256k1_recover)
    - [`log_bench`](#log_bench)

### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function initializes the environment, runs a test for the `fd_secp256k1_recover` function, logs a success message, and then halts the program.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments passed to the program.
    - `argv`: An array of strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Call `fd_boot` to initialize the environment with command-line arguments.
    - Create a random number generator `rng` using `fd_rng_new` and `fd_rng_join`.
    - Call [`test_recover`](#test_recover) with the `rng` to test the `fd_secp256k1_recover` function.
    - Log a notice message 'pass' using `FD_LOG_NOTICE`.
    - Call `fd_halt` to terminate the program.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer `0`, indicating successful execution.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`test_recover`](#test_recover)
