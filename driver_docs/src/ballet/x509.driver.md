- **[fd_x509_mock.c](x509/fd_x509_mock.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_x509_mock.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase provides functions for handling mock X.509 certificates, including generating a certificate with a specified public key and extracting the public key from a certificate.
- **[fd_x509_mock.h](x509/fd_x509_mock.h.driver.md)**: The `fd_x509_mock.h` file generates mock X.509 certificates for QUIC peer-to-peer use, specifically designed to pass as valid with rustls peers despite being semantically invalid, and includes functions for creating and extracting public keys from these certificates.
- **[Local.mk](x509/Local.mk.driver.md)**: The `Local.mk` file in the `firedancer` codebase specifies the headers, objects, and unit tests for the `fd_x509_mock` component within the `ballet/x509` directory.
- **[test_x509.c](x509/test_x509.c.driver.md)**: The `test_x509.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase contains tests for verifying the functionality of X.509 certificate handling, including public key extraction and certificate integrity checks.
