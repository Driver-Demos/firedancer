# Purpose
This code is a C header file that defines a data structure for a Zstandard decompression stream, likely used in a larger compression/decompression library. It includes a macro for alignment (`FD_ZSTD_DSTREAM_ALIGN`) and a magic number (`FD_ZSTD_DSTREAM_MAGIC`) for identifying or validating the structure. The `fd_zstd_dstream` structure is defined with specific alignment requirements to optimize memory access and performance, particularly for SIMD operations. The structure contains a `magic` field for integrity checks, a `mem_sz` field to store the size of the memory, and a flexible array member `mem` for dynamic memory allocation, with padding to ensure proper alignment. This setup is typical for managing memory in performance-critical applications.

### fd\_zstd\_dstream
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `magic`: A unique identifier for the data structure, likely used for validation or identification.
    - `mem_sz`: Stores the size of the memory allocated for the stream.
    - `pad`: A padding array to ensure proper alignment of the structure.
    - `mem`: A flexible array member used to store the actual data, starting at a 32-byte aligned address.
- **Description**: The `fd_zstd_dstream` structure is designed for handling Zstandard decompression streams, ensuring 32-byte alignment for performance optimization. It includes a magic number for validation, a memory size indicator, and a flexible array member for data storage, with padding to maintain alignment.
