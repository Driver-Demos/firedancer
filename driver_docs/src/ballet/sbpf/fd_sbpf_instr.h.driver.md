# Purpose
This C header file defines data structures and functions for handling eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter) instructions, specifically for a custom or specialized eBPF virtual machine implementation. It introduces several structures to represent different types of eBPF opcodes, such as `fd_sbpf_opcode_any_t`, `fd_sbpf_opcode_normal_t`, and `fd_sbpf_opcode_mem_t`, each using bit fields to efficiently store opcode information. The `fd_sbpf_instr_t` structure encapsulates a complete eBPF instruction, including opcode, destination and source registers, an offset, and an immediate value. Additionally, the file provides two inline functions, [`fd_sbpf_instr`](#fd_sbpf_instr) and [`fd_sbpf_ulong`](#fd_sbpf_ulong), for converting between a `ulong` representation and the `fd_sbpf_instr_t` structure, facilitating the encoding and decoding of instructions. This header is part of a larger system, as indicated by the inclusion of a utility header and the use of macros for managing function prototypes.
