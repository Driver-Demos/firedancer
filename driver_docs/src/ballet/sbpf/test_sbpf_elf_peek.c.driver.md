# Purpose
This C source code file is designed to test the compatibility and versioning of Solana BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter) programs, specifically focusing on different versions of ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) binaries. The file includes a series of test functions that verify the SBPF version of various ELF binaries, using a custom testing framework. The primary technical components include the `fd_sbpf_elf_peek` function, which inspects the ELF binaries to determine their SBPF version, and the `FD_TEST_CUSTOM` macro, which asserts the expected version outcomes. The code imports ELF binaries using the `FD_IMPORT_BINARY` macro, which is defined to load specific ELF files from a given directory path.

The file serves as an executable test suite, as indicated by the presence of a [`main`](#main) function that initializes the testing environment with `fd_boot`, executes the test functions, and then cleans up with `fd_halt`. The tests cover scenarios where the ELF binaries are expected to match specific SBPF versions, and they also check for unsupported versions. This code is not intended to be a library or header file for external use but rather a standalone executable for validating the SBPF versioning logic within a specific context, likely as part of a larger testing framework for Solana BPF programs.

# Functions

---
### test\_sbpf\_version\_default<!-- {{#callable:test_sbpf_version_default}} -->
The function `test_sbpf_version_default` tests the default behavior of the `fd_sbpf_elf_peek` function when handling different versions of Solana program ELF files.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize an `fd_sbpf_elf_info_t` structure named `info` to store ELF information.
    - Set `min_version` and `max_version` to `FD_SBPF_V0`, indicating the version range to be checked.
    - Call `fd_sbpf_elf_peek` with the ELF data for `hello_solana_program_elf` and check if the `sbpf_version` in `info` is `FD_SBPF_V0`.
    - Call `fd_sbpf_elf_peek` with the ELF data for `hello_solana_program_sbpf_v2_elf` and check if the `sbpf_version` in `info` is `FD_SBPF_V0`, indicating that version 2 is accepted as version 0.
    - Call `fd_sbpf_elf_peek` with the ELF data for `hello_solana_program_old_sbpf_v2_elf` and verify that the result is `NULL`, indicating that the old version 2 is unsupported.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value but uses assertions to validate the expected behavior of the `fd_sbpf_elf_peek` function with different ELF files.

### test\_sbpf\_version\_from\_elf\_header<!-- {{#callable:test_sbpf_version_from_elf_header}} -->
The function `test_sbpf_version_from_elf_header` tests the SBPF version compatibility of different ELF binaries against specified version constraints.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize a `fd_sbpf_elf_info_t` structure named `info` to store ELF information.
    - Define `min_version` as `FD_SBPF_V0` and `max_version` as `FD_SBPF_V2`.
    - Call `fd_sbpf_elf_peek` with the ELF binary `hello_solana_program_elf` and check if the `sbpf_version` is `FD_SBPF_V0` using `FD_TEST_CUSTOM`.
    - Call `fd_sbpf_elf_peek` with the ELF binary `hello_solana_program_sbpf_v2_elf` and check if the `sbpf_version` is `FD_SBPF_V2` using `FD_TEST_CUSTOM`.
    - Call `fd_sbpf_elf_peek` with the ELF binary `hello_solana_program_old_sbpf_v2_elf` and check if the result is `NULL` using `FD_TEST_CUSTOM`, indicating unsupported version.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value but performs assertions to verify the SBPF version compatibility of ELF binaries.

### test\_sbpf\_version\_from\_elf\_header\_with\_min<!-- {{#callable:test_sbpf_version_from_elf_header_with_min}} -->
The function `test_sbpf_version_from_elf_header_with_min` tests the compatibility of different ELF binaries with a specific SBPF version range, ensuring that only binaries matching the specified version are accepted.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize an `fd_sbpf_elf_info_t` structure named `info`.
    - Set `min_version` and `max_version` to `FD_SBPF_V2`.
    - Call `fd_sbpf_elf_peek` with `hello_solana_program_elf` and check that the result is `NULL`, indicating that version 0 is not supported.
    - Call `fd_sbpf_elf_peek` with `hello_solana_program_sbpf_v2_elf` and verify that the `sbpf_version` in `info` is `FD_SBPF_V2`, confirming support for version 2.
    - Call `fd_sbpf_elf_peek` with `hello_solana_program_old_sbpf_v2_elf` and check that the result is `NULL`, indicating that the old version 2 is unsupported.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it performs assertions to validate ELF version compatibility.

### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function initializes the environment, runs a series of tests on SBPF version handling, and then terminates the program.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The count of command-line arguments passed to the program.
    - `argv`: An array of strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Call `fd_boot` to initialize the environment with command-line arguments.
    - Execute [`test_sbpf_version_default`](#test_sbpf_version_default) to test default SBPF version handling.
    - Execute [`test_sbpf_version_from_elf_header`](#test_sbpf_version_from_elf_header) to test SBPF version handling based on ELF headers.
    - Execute [`test_sbpf_version_from_elf_header_with_min`](#test_sbpf_version_from_elf_header_with_min) to test SBPF version handling with a minimum version requirement.
    - Call `fd_halt` to clean up and terminate the program.
    - Return 0 to indicate successful execution.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer value of 0, indicating successful execution.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`test_sbpf_version_default`](#test_sbpf_version_default)
    - [`test_sbpf_version_from_elf_header`](#test_sbpf_version_from_elf_header)
