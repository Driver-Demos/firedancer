# Purpose
This C source code file is designed to test the functionality of loading and handling eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter) programs, specifically focusing on scenarios involving duplicate entry points within ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) files. The code imports an ELF binary, `duplicate_entrypoint_entry.elf`, and examines its properties, particularly the presence of two symbol entries with the same name "entrypoint." The test ensures that the correct entry point is registered and that erroneous entries are not mistakenly included in the call destinations (`calldests`). The code uses a set of predefined syscalls, represented as hexadecimal values, which are inserted into the syscall table for the eBPF program. The test checks that the program correctly identifies valid and invalid call destinations, ensuring robust handling of ELF files with duplicate symbols.

The file includes a main function, indicating that it is an executable program rather than a library or header file. It initializes necessary resources, such as memory allocation for the eBPF program and syscall structures, and performs cleanup after the test execution. The code leverages several utility functions and macros, such as `FD_IMPORT_BINARY`, `fd_sbpf_program_new`, and `fd_sbpf_syscalls_insert`, to facilitate the loading and testing of the eBPF program. The primary focus of this file is to validate the behavior of the eBPF loader in handling specific edge cases related to ELF symbol entries, ensuring that the system can correctly manage and execute eBPF programs with complex symbol configurations.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `fd_sbpf_loader.h`
- `../../util/fd_util.h`


# Global Variables

---
### \_syscalls
- **Type**: `uint const[]`
- **Description**: The `_syscalls` variable is a global constant array of unsigned integers, each represented in hexadecimal format. These integers likely represent identifiers or addresses for system calls used within the program.
- **Use**: This array is used to initialize a set of system calls in the `fd_sbpf_syscalls_t` structure by iterating over its elements and inserting them into the system calls set.


# Functions

---
### test\_duplicate\_entrypoint\_entry<!-- {{#callable:test_duplicate_entrypoint_entry}} -->
The function `test_duplicate_entrypoint_entry` tests the handling of duplicate entry points in an ELF file by verifying the registration of call destinations.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize a scratch memory context using `fd_scratch_push` and `fd_scratch_virtual`.
    - Peek into the ELF file `duplicate_entrypoint_entry_elf` to gather information using `fd_sbpf_elf_peek`.
    - Allocate memory for read-only data using `fd_valloc_malloc` based on the ELF information.
    - Create a new SBPF program with [`fd_sbpf_program_new`](fd_sbpf_loader.c.driver.md#fd_sbpf_program_new), using the allocated memory and ELF information.
    - Initialize a new set of syscalls with `fd_sbpf_syscalls_new` and populate it with predefined syscalls from `_syscalls`.
    - Load the SBPF program using [`fd_sbpf_program_load`](fd_sbpf_loader.c.driver.md#fd_sbpf_program_load) and verify successful loading with `FD_TEST`.
    - Test the call destinations using `fd_sbpf_calldests_test` to ensure the correct entry points are registered or not, specifically checking addresses 595 and 3920.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value but performs assertions to verify the correct handling of duplicate entry points in the ELF file.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`fd_sbpf_program_new`](fd_sbpf_loader.c.driver.md#fd_sbpf_program_new)
    - [`fd_sbpf_program_align`](fd_sbpf_loader.c.driver.md#fd_sbpf_program_align)
    - [`fd_sbpf_program_footprint`](fd_sbpf_loader.c.driver.md#fd_sbpf_program_footprint)
    - [`fd_sbpf_program_load`](fd_sbpf_loader.c.driver.md#fd_sbpf_program_load)


---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function initializes the environment, runs a test on a duplicate entry point in an ELF file, and then cleans up before exiting.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments passed to the program.
    - `argv`: An array of strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Call `fd_boot` to initialize the environment with command-line arguments.
    - Declare and initialize a static memory buffer `scratch_mem` of 32MB and a static aligned memory buffer `scratch_fmem`.
    - Attach the scratch memory using `fd_scratch_attach` for temporary memory allocation.
    - Invoke [`test_duplicate_entrypoint_entry`](#test_duplicate_entrypoint_entry) to perform tests on the ELF file with duplicate entry points.
    - Detach the scratch memory using `fd_scratch_detach` to clean up resources.
    - Call `fd_halt` to perform any necessary shutdown operations.
    - Return 0 to indicate successful execution.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer value of 0, indicating successful execution.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`test_duplicate_entrypoint_entry`](#test_duplicate_entrypoint_entry)
