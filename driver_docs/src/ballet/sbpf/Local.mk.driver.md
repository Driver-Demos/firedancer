# Purpose
The provided content is from a Makefile, which is a build automation tool used to manage the build process of software projects. This Makefile snippet defines a series of build and test instructions for components related to "sbpf" (likely a software module or library). The `add-hdrs` and `add-objs` functions are used to specify header files and object files, respectively, that are part of the build process. The `ifdef FD_HAS_HOSTED` conditional block indicates that certain unit tests and fuzz tests should only be compiled and executed if the `FD_HAS_HOSTED` variable is defined, suggesting a conditional build environment. The `make-unit-test` and `run-unit-test` functions are used to create and execute unit tests, while `make-fuzz-test` is used to create fuzz tests, ensuring the robustness and reliability of the software components.
