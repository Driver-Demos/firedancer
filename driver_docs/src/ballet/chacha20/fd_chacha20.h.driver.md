# Purpose
This C header file defines constants and a function prototype related to the ChaCha20 encryption algorithm, which is a stream cipher known for its simplicity and efficiency. The file specifies the size of the ChaCha20 block and key, with `FD_CHACHA20_BLOCK_SZ` set to 64 bytes and `FD_CHACHA20_KEY_SZ` set to 32 bytes, respectively. It declares the [`fd_chacha20_block`](#fd_chacha20_block) function, which is responsible for generating a ChaCha20 block given an output block, an encryption key, and a combination of block index and nonce. The function is designed to handle aligned memory for these inputs, but currently, it is limited to processing a single block at a time, as indicated by the FIXME comment suggesting future support for multiple blocks. The file does not yet implement full encryption or decryption functions, as they are not required at this stage.

### fd\_chacha20\_block
- **Type**: `function pointer`
- **Description**: `fd_chacha20_block` is a function that implements the ChaCha20 block function, which is a core component of the ChaCha20 encryption algorithm. It takes three parameters: a pointer to the output block, a pointer to the encryption key, and a pointer to the block index and nonce. The function is designed to process a single 64-byte block of data using a 32-byte key and a 16-byte index/nonce combination.
- **Use**: This function is used to perform the core block transformation in the ChaCha20 encryption process, generating a 64-byte output block from the given key and nonce.
