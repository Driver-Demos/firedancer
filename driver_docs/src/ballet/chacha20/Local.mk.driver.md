# Purpose
The provided content is from a Makefile, which is used to automate the build process of a software project. This Makefile snippet is specifically configuring the inclusion of header files and object files related to the ChaCha20 encryption algorithm and its random number generator variant. It conditionally adds object files based on the availability of AVX or SSE instruction sets, optimizing the build for different hardware capabilities. Additionally, it defines and runs unit tests for the ChaCha20 and ChaCha20 RNG functionalities, ensuring that these components are correctly implemented and function as expected. The use of macros like `add-hdrs`, `add-objs`, `make-unit-test`, and `run-unit-test` indicates a structured approach to managing dependencies and testing within the build process.
