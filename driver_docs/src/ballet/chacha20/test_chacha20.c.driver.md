# Purpose
This C source code file is designed to test and benchmark the `fd_chacha20_block` function, which is part of a cryptographic library implementing the ChaCha20 stream cipher. The file includes two primary functions: `test_chacha20_block` and `bench_chacha20_block`. The `test_chacha20_block` function verifies the correctness of the `fd_chacha20_block` function by comparing its output against a known test vector from the IETF RFC 7539, ensuring that the implementation produces the expected cryptographic output. If the output does not match the expected result, an error is logged. The `bench_chacha20_block` function measures the performance of the `fd_chacha20_block` function by executing it multiple times and calculating the throughput in gigabits per second and the time per byte in nanoseconds, providing insights into the efficiency of the implementation.

The file is structured as an executable C program, with a [`main`](#main) function that initializes the environment, runs the test and benchmark functions, and then terminates the program. It includes headers for necessary dependencies, such as `fd_ballet.h` and `fd_chacha20.h`, which likely contain the definitions and implementations of the cryptographic functions and logging utilities used in this file. The code is focused on a specific cryptographic operation, providing both validation and performance metrics, which are crucial for ensuring the reliability and efficiency of cryptographic software.
# Imports and Dependencies

- `../fd_ballet.h`
- `fd_chacha20.h`


# Functions

---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function initializes the environment, runs tests and benchmarks for the ChaCha20 block cipher, logs the results, and then halts the program.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The count of command-line arguments passed to the program.
    - `argv`: An array of strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Call `fd_boot` to initialize the environment with command-line arguments.
    - Invoke `test_chacha20_block` to run a test on the ChaCha20 block cipher implementation.
    - Invoke `bench_chacha20_block` to benchmark the performance of the ChaCha20 block cipher.
    - Log a notice message indicating the tests and benchmarks passed.
    - Call `fd_halt` to cleanly shut down the environment.
    - Return 0 to indicate successful execution.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer value of 0, indicating successful execution.
