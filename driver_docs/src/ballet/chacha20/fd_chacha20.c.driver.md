# Purpose
This C source code file provides a reference implementation of the ChaCha20 block function, a core component of the ChaCha20 stream cipher. The code is designed to transform a 512-bit input block using a 256-bit key and a 128-bit nonce, producing a pseudo-random output block of the same size. The implementation is not optimized for high performance, as noted in the comments, but it is structured to be easily parallelizable using SIMD instructions like SSE or AVX if needed. The main technical components include the [`fd_chacha20_quarter_round`](#fd_chacha20_quarter_round) function, which performs the quarter-round operations essential to the ChaCha20 algorithm, and the [`fd_chacha20_block`](#fd_chacha20_block) function, which orchestrates the setup and execution of 20 rounds of the ChaCha20 algorithm.

The file is intended to be part of a larger cryptographic library, as indicated by the inclusion of a header file (`fd_chacha20.h`). It does not define a public API or external interface directly but provides the core functionality that can be utilized by other components of the library or application. The code constructs the ChaCha20 block state matrix, performs the necessary transformations through repeated quarter-round operations, and finally combines the transformed state with the original input to produce the final output block. This implementation is a crucial part of any system that requires secure, high-speed encryption or decryption using the ChaCha20 algorithm.

### fd\_chacha20\_quarter\_round<!-- {{#callable:fd_chacha20_quarter_round}} -->
The `fd_chacha20_quarter_round` function performs a single ChaCha20 quarter round operation on four 32-bit unsigned integers, modifying them in place.
- **Inputs**:
    - `a`: Pointer to the first 32-bit unsigned integer involved in the quarter round.
    - `b`: Pointer to the second 32-bit unsigned integer involved in the quarter round.
    - `c`: Pointer to the third 32-bit unsigned integer involved in the quarter round.
    - `d`: Pointer to the fourth 32-bit unsigned integer involved in the quarter round.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Add the value pointed to by `b` to the value pointed to by `a`.
    - XOR the value pointed to by `d` with the updated value of `a`.
    - Rotate the value pointed to by `d` left by 16 bits.
    - Add the value pointed to by `d` to the value pointed to by `c`.
    - XOR the value pointed to by `b` with the updated value of `c`.
    - Rotate the value pointed to by `b` left by 12 bits.
    - Add the value pointed to by `b` to the value pointed to by `a`.
    - XOR the value pointed to by `d` with the updated value of `a`.
    - Rotate the value pointed to by `d` left by 8 bits.
    - Add the value pointed to by `d` to the value pointed to by `c`.
    - XOR the value pointed to by `b` with the updated value of `c`.
    - Rotate the value pointed to by `b` left by 7 bits.
- **Output**: The function modifies the values pointed to by `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` in place, with no return value.

### fd\_chacha20\_block<!-- {{#callable:fd_chacha20_block}} -->
The `fd_chacha20_block` function implements the ChaCha20 block function, which processes a block of data using a key and nonce to produce a cryptographic output.
- **Inputs**:
    - `_block`: A pointer to the memory location where the output block will be stored, assumed to be aligned to 64 bytes.
    - `_key`: A pointer to the 256-bit key used for encryption, assumed to be aligned to 32 bytes.
    - `_idx_nonce`: A pointer to the 128-bit index and nonce, assumed to be aligned to 16 bytes.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Aligns the input pointers to the required byte boundaries for performance optimization.
    - Initializes the ChaCha20 block state with constants, the key, and the index/nonce.
    - Copies the initial block state to a temporary array for later use.
    - Performs 20 rounds of the ChaCha20 quarter round function, alternating between column and diagonal rounds.
    - Adds the original block state to the transformed block state to complete the ChaCha20 block transformation.
- **Output**: Returns a pointer to the transformed block, which contains the cryptographic output.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`fd_chacha20_quarter_round`](#fd_chacha20_quarter_round)
