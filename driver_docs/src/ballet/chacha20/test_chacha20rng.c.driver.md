# Purpose
This C source code file is an executable program designed to test and benchmark the functionality of a ChaCha20-based random number generator (RNG) implemented in the `fd_chacha20rng` module. The program begins by initializing the environment with `fd_boot` and then proceeds to create and configure an instance of the ChaCha20 RNG. It verifies the alignment and size of the RNG structure to ensure it meets expected specifications. The RNG is initialized with a predefined 32-byte key, and its output is tested against known values to confirm correct operation. The program then benchmarks the RNG's performance by measuring the time taken to generate a large number of random numbers, reporting the throughput in gigabits per second and the number of random numbers generated per second.

Additionally, if the system supports AVX (Advanced Vector Extensions), the program benchmarks the performance of the `fd_chacha20rng_refill_avx` function, which is likely an optimized version of the RNG refill operation using AVX instructions. This benchmarking is done by measuring the throughput of the RNG when refilling its buffer with random data. The program concludes by cleaning up the RNG instance and logging a success message before halting. This file serves as both a validation and performance testing tool for the ChaCha20 RNG implementation, ensuring its correctness and efficiency on supported hardware.

# Functions

### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function initializes, tests, and benchmarks a ChaCha20-based random number generator (RNG) using various configurations and outputs performance metrics.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments passed to the program.
    - `argv`: An array of strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize the program environment with `fd_boot`.
    - Create a `fd_chacha20rng_t` RNG object and verify its alignment and size.
    - Join the RNG object to a new ChaCha20 RNG instance in modular mode.
    - Initialize the RNG with a predefined 32-byte key.
    - Test the RNG output against expected values to ensure correctness.
    - Benchmark the RNG's performance by generating random numbers and measuring throughput in Gbps and operations per second.
    - If AVX is available, benchmark the AVX-optimized refill function similarly.
    - Clean up by deleting the RNG instance and halting the program.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer status code, typically 0 for successful execution.
