# Purpose
This C source code file provides secure implementations of various operations on points in the Ed25519 elliptic curve, specifically focusing on constant-time execution to prevent side-channel attacks. The file includes functions for securely adding two points (`fd_ed25519_point_add_secure`), doubling a point multiple times (`fd_ed25519_point_dbln_secure`), conditionally selecting between two points ([`fd_ed25519_point_if`](#fd_ed25519_point_if)), and conditionally negating a point (`fd_ed25519_point_neg_if`). These operations are crucial for cryptographic applications where the secrecy of the input data must be preserved, as they ensure that the execution time does not vary based on the input values, thus preventing attackers from inferring secret information through timing analysis.

The file defines macros and functions that manipulate points in the extended Edwards coordinates, using precomputed tables and temporary variables to maintain security. The use of macros like `FD_R43X6_GE_ADD_TABLE_ALT` and `FD_R43X6_GE_DBL_ALT` highlights the emphasis on efficient and secure arithmetic operations. The code is designed to be small and auditable, with no local variables that need clearing, and it uses specific techniques to clear registers upon function exit. This ensures that sensitive data does not remain in memory longer than necessary, further enhancing security. The file is intended to be part of a larger cryptographic library, providing essential building blocks for secure elliptic curve operations.

# Functions

### fd\_ed25519\_point\_if<!-- {{#callable:fd_ed25519_point_if}} -->
The `fd_ed25519_point_if` function conditionally assigns one of two given Ed25519 points to a result point based on a secret condition, ensuring constant-time execution.
- **Inputs**:
    - `r`: A pointer to an `fd_ed25519_point_t` structure where the result will be stored.
    - `secret_cond`: An unsigned char (uchar) that acts as a boolean condition (0 or 1) to determine which point to assign to `r`.
    - `a0`: A pointer to a constant `fd_ed25519_point_t` structure representing the first point option.
    - `a1`: A pointer to a constant `fd_ed25519_point_t` structure representing the second point option.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function uses the `wwl_if` function to conditionally select between the fields of `a0` and `a1` based on the negated `secret_cond` value.
    - For each field (`P03`, `P14`, `P25`) of the result point `r`, it assigns the corresponding field from `a0` if `secret_cond` is true (1), otherwise it assigns from `a1`.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it modifies the `fd_ed25519_point_t` structure pointed to by `r` in place.
