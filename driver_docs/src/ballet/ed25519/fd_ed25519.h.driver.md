# Purpose
This C header file, `fd_ed25519.h`, provides a set of APIs for performing cryptographic operations using the Ed25519 signature scheme. It includes function prototypes for generating public keys from private keys, signing messages, verifying signatures, and verifying batches of signatures for a single message. The file defines several error codes to indicate the success or failure of these operations, such as `FD_ED25519_SUCCESS` for successful operations and specific error codes for invalid signatures, public keys, or message mismatches. Additionally, it includes a utility function to convert error codes into human-readable strings. The header also ensures the inclusion of necessary dependencies, such as a SHA-512 hashing module, which is integral to the Ed25519 operations.
# Imports and Dependencies

# Global Variables

### fd\_ed25519\_public\_from\_private
- **Type**: `function`
- **Description**: The `fd_ed25519_public_from_private` function computes the public key corresponding to a given private key using the Ed25519 algorithm. It requires a 32-byte memory region for both the public and private keys and utilizes a SHA-512 calculator for hashing operations. The function does not perform input validation and sanitizes the SHA-512 state and stack to minimize the risk of leaking private key information.
- **Use**: This function is used to derive a public key from a private key in Ed25519 cryptographic operations.


---
### fd\_ed25519\_strerror
- **Type**: `FD_FN_CONST char const *`
- **Description**: The `fd_ed25519_strerror` function is a global function that converts error codes related to ED25519 operations into human-readable strings. It takes an integer error code as input and returns a constant character pointer to a string that describes the error. The returned string is guaranteed to be non-NULL and has an infinite lifetime.
- **Use**: This function is used to translate ED25519 error codes into descriptive strings for easier debugging and error handling.


# Function Declarations (Public API)

---
### fd\_ed25519\_verify<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_ed25519_verify}} -->
Verifies a message signature using the Ed25519 standard.
- **Description**: Use this function to verify the authenticity of a message by checking its signature against a given public key using the Ed25519 standard. This function requires a SHA-512 context for hashing operations and assumes that the signature and public key are provided in the correct format and size. It returns a success code if the signature is valid or an error code indicating the type of failure if the verification fails. The function does not perform input validation, so ensure that all inputs are correctly formatted and initialized before calling.
- **Inputs**:
    - `msg`: A pointer to the message data to verify. The message can be of any size, including zero, in which case msg can be NULL.
    - `msg_sz`: The size of the message in bytes. Can be zero if msg is NULL.
    - `sig`: A pointer to a 64-byte array containing the signature to verify. Must not be NULL.
    - `public_key`: A pointer to a 32-byte array containing the public key used for verification. Must not be NULL.
    - `sha`: A pointer to an initialized fd_sha512_t structure used for SHA-512 hashing during verification. The caller must ensure it is properly initialized before calling.
- **Output**: Returns FD_ED25519_SUCCESS (0) if the signature is valid, or an error code (FD_ED25519_ERR_SIG, FD_ED25519_ERR_PUBKEY, FD_ED25519_ERR_MSG) indicating the reason for failure.

### fd\_ed25519\_verify\_batch\_single\_msg<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_ed25519_verify_batch_single_msg}} -->
Verifies a batch of ED25519 signatures over a single message.
- **Description**: This function is used to verify multiple ED25519 signatures for a single message using a batch processing approach. It is useful when you have multiple signatures and public keys that need to be verified against the same message, improving efficiency over verifying each signature individually. The function requires that the batch size is greater than zero and does not exceed a predefined maximum. It returns a success code if all signatures are valid, or an error code indicating the type of failure if any signature is invalid.
- **Inputs**:
    - `msg`: A pointer to the message data to be verified. The message can be of any size, including zero, in which case msg can be NULL.
    - `msg_sz`: The size of the message in bytes. It can be zero if the message is empty.
    - `signatures`: A pointer to an array of signatures, each 64 bytes long, corresponding to the message. The array must have at least 64 * batch_sz bytes.
    - `pubkeys`: A pointer to an array of public keys, each 32 bytes long, used to verify the signatures. The array must have at least 32 * batch_sz bytes.
    - `shas`: An array of pointers to SHA-512 calculator handles, one for each signature in the batch. The array must have at least batch_sz elements.
    - `batch_sz`: The number of signatures, public keys, and SHA-512 handles in the batch. Must be greater than zero and not exceed the maximum allowed batch size.
- **Output**: Returns FD_ED25519_SUCCESS (0) if all signatures are verified successfully, or an FD_ED25519_ERR_* code indicating the type of failure otherwise.

### fd\_ed25519\_strerror<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_ed25519_strerror}} -->
Convert an error code to a human-readable string.
- **Description**: Use this function to obtain a descriptive string for a given error code returned by other fd_ed25519 functions. This is useful for logging or displaying error messages to users. The function accepts an error code and returns a constant string describing the error. It handles known error codes specifically and returns "unknown" for any unrecognized codes. The returned string is always non-NULL and has an infinite lifetime.
- **Inputs**:
    - `err`: An integer representing the error code to be converted. Valid values are FD_ED25519_SUCCESS, FD_ED25519_ERR_SIG, FD_ED25519_ERR_PUBKEY, and FD_ED25519_ERR_MSG. Any other value will result in the string "unknown".
- **Output**: A constant string describing the error code. The string is non-NULL and has an infinite lifetime.
- **See also**: [`fd_ed25519_strerror`](fd_ed25519_user.c.driver.md#fd_ed25519_strerror)  (Implementation)
