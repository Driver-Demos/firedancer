# Purpose
This C source code file is designed to provide secure cryptographic operations related to the Curve25519 elliptic curve, specifically focusing on constant-time implementations to prevent side-channel attacks. The file includes functions that are critical for cryptographic operations, such as scalar multiplication on the Ed25519 curve, which is a variant of Curve25519 used in digital signatures. The code is structured to ensure that operations are performed in constant time, meaning the execution time does not depend on the input values, which is crucial for maintaining the secrecy of cryptographic keys. This is achieved through techniques like avoiding data-dependent branching and using constant-time arithmetic operations.

The file conditionally includes different implementations based on the availability of AVX-512 instructions, which are advanced vector extensions that can optimize performance on supported hardware. The functions within this file, such as [`fd_ed25519_scalar_radix16`](#fd_ed25519_scalar_radix16), [`const_time_eq`](#const_time_eq), and [`fd_ed25519_table_select`](#fd_ed25519_table_select), are designed to handle sensitive data securely by clearing local variables and registers before exiting, thus minimizing the risk of data leakage. The main function, `fd_ed25519_scalar_mul_base_const_time`, performs scalar multiplication of the base point in constant time, which is a fundamental operation in cryptographic protocols like digital signatures. This function and its sub-functions are marked as sensitive and are expected to be static inline, ensuring that they are optimized for performance and security. Overall, this file is a specialized component of a cryptographic library, providing secure and efficient implementations of elliptic curve operations.

# Functions

---
### fd\_ed25519\_scalar\_radix16<!-- {{#callable:fd_ed25519_scalar_radix16}} -->
The function `fd_ed25519_scalar_radix16` converts a 32-byte scalar into a 64-byte array of values in the range [-8, 8] using a radix-16 representation.
- **Inputs**:
    - `secret_e`: A 64-element character array that will store the output values in the range [-8, 8].
    - `secret_a`: A 32-byte unsigned character array representing the input scalar, assumed to be valid.
    - `tmp_secret_carry`: A pointer to a character used to temporarily store carry values during computation.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize `tmp_secret_carry` to 0.
    - Iterate over each byte of `secret_a`, splitting each byte into two 4-bit values and storing them in `secret_e`.
    - Iterate over the first 63 elements of `secret_e`, adjusting each value by adding the carry, computing a new carry, and reducing the value to fit within the range [-8, 8].
    - Adjust the last element of `secret_e` by adding the final carry.
- **Output**: The function outputs a 64-element character array `secret_e` where each element is in the range [-8, 8], representing the input scalar in a radix-16 format.


---
### const\_time\_eq<!-- {{#callable:const_time_eq}} -->
The `const_time_eq` function performs a constant-time comparison of two unsigned characters and returns 1 if they are equal, otherwise 0.
- **Inputs**:
    - `secret_a`: An unsigned character representing the first value to compare.
    - `secret_b`: An unsigned character representing the second value to compare.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function calculates the bitwise XOR of `secret_a` and `secret_b`, which results in 0 if they are equal and a non-zero value otherwise.
    - It subtracts 1 from the XOR result, which will underflow to a large unsigned integer if the XOR result is 0 (i.e., the inputs are equal).
    - The result is then right-shifted by 31 bits, which will yield 1 if the inputs are equal (since the subtraction underflowed) and 0 otherwise.
- **Output**: The function returns an unsigned character, 1 if `secret_a` is equal to `secret_b`, and 0 otherwise.


---
### fd\_ed25519\_table\_select<!-- {{#callable:fd_ed25519_table_select}} -->
The `fd_ed25519_table_select` function selects a precomputed point from a table based on a given index and sign, performing operations in constant time to ensure security.
- **Inputs**:
    - `r`: A pointer to an `fd_ed25519_point_t` structure where the selected point will be stored.
    - `tmp`: A pointer to an `fd_ed25519_point_t` structure used as a temporary storage during selection.
    - `j`: An integer representing the index of the table from which the point is selected.
    - `secret`: A signed character representing the secret value used to determine the point selection.
    - `tmp_secret_idx`: A pointer to an unsigned character where the index of the selected point will be stored.
    - `tmp_secret_sgn`: A pointer to an unsigned character where the sign of the secret will be stored.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Determine the sign of the secret and store it in `tmp_secret_sgn` by right-shifting the secret by 7 bits.
    - Calculate the absolute index of the secret and store it in `tmp_secret_idx` by adjusting for the sign and subtracting one.
    - Initialize the temporary point `tmp` to zero using `fd_ed25519_point_set_zero_precomputed`.
    - Iterate over the possible indices (0 to 7) and use [`fd_ed25519_point_if`](avx512/fd_curve25519_secure.c.driver.md#fd_ed25519_point_if) to conditionally select the point from the table based on `tmp_secret_idx`, storing the result alternately in `r` and `tmp`.
    - Negate the selected point in `r` if the secret was negative, using `fd_ed25519_point_neg_if`.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value but modifies the point `r` to contain the selected point from the precomputed table, potentially negated based on the sign of the secret.
