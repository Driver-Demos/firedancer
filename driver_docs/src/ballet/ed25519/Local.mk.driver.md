# Purpose
The provided content is from a Makefile, which is used to automate the build process of a software project. This particular Makefile snippet is focused on cryptographic components, specifically related to the Ed25519 and X25519 algorithms, as well as Curve25519 and Ristretto255. The `add-hdrs` and `add-objs` functions are used to include header files and object files, respectively, into the build process, indicating the files necessary for compiling the cryptographic modules. The `make-unit-test` and `run-unit-test` functions define and execute unit tests for these cryptographic components, ensuring their correctness and reliability. Additionally, conditional fuzz testing is set up with `make-fuzz-test` for Ed25519 verification functions, which is executed if the `FD_HAS_HOSTED` variable is defined, allowing for robustness testing under various input conditions.
