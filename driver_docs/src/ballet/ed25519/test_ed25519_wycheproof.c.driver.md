# Purpose
The provided C source code file is a test data file generated by a script named `gen_wycheproofs.py`. It contains a static array of test cases for verifying Ed25519 digital signatures, a widely used elliptic curve signature scheme. Each test case is represented by a structure `fd_ed25519_verify_wycheproof_t`, which includes fields for a comment, message, message size, public key, signature, test case ID, and a boolean indicating whether the test case is expected to pass (`ok` field). The array `ed25519_verify_wycheproofs` is populated with various test cases, each designed to test different aspects of the Ed25519 signature verification process, including valid signatures, edge cases, and known failure scenarios.

This file is intended to be included in a larger test suite for Ed25519 signature verification, providing a comprehensive set of test vectors to ensure the correctness and robustness of the implementation. The test cases cover a range of scenarios, including special values for the signature components, malleability checks, and regression tests for known arithmetic errors. The file does not define any public APIs or external interfaces; instead, it serves as a data source for testing purposes, likely to be used in conjunction with a test harness that iterates over the test cases and verifies the behavior of the signature verification function against the expected outcomes.

### ed25519\_verify\_wycheproofs
- **Type**: ``fd_ed25519_verify_wycheproof_t const[]``
- **Description**: The `ed25519_verify_wycheproofs` is a static constant array of `fd_ed25519_verify_wycheproof_t` structures. Each element in the array represents a test case for verifying Ed25519 signatures, containing fields such as test case ID (`tc_id`), a comment, the message (`msg`) and its size (`msg_sz`), the public key (`pub`), the signature (`sig`), and a boolean indicating if the test case is expected to pass (`ok`).
- **Use**: This array is used to store a series of test cases for verifying the correctness of Ed25519 signature verification against known test vectors.
