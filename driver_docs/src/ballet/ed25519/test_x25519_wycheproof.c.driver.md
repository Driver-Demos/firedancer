# Purpose
The provided C code defines a data structure for a set of test vectors used in cryptographic verification, specifically for the X25519 key exchange protocol, and is automatically generated for internal use within a testing framework. It consists of an array of structs, each representing a test case with fields such as `tc_id`, `comment`, `shared`, `prv`, `pub`, and `ok`, which hold the test case identifier, descriptive comments, shared secret data, private and public key data, and a boolean indicating the expected success of the test case, respectively. The hexadecimal strings in the `shared`, `prv`, and `pub` fields represent cryptographic keys or shared secrets, and the comments provide context for each test case, often highlighting special conditions or edge cases. This code is not an executable or a library but serves as a static dataset for validating the correctness and robustness of an X25519 implementation against predefined test vectors, likely derived from the Wycheproof project, ensuring comprehensive testing of cryptographic operations under various scenarios. The presence of a terminating `{0}` suggests the use of a C-style array, marking the end of the array, which is a common practice in C programming.
# Imports and Dependencies

- `../fd_ballet_base.h`


# Global Variables

---
### x25519\_verify\_wycheproofs
- **Type**: `fd_x25519_verify_wycheproof_t[]`
- **Description**: The `x25519_verify_wycheproofs` is a static constant array of `fd_x25519_verify_wycheproof_t` structures. Each element in the array represents a test case for verifying the X25519 key exchange implementation against known test vectors from the Wycheproof project. The structure contains fields for test case ID, a comment describing the test case, the expected shared secret, the private key, the public key, and a boolean indicating if the test case is expected to pass.
- **Use**: This variable is used to store and organize test cases for verifying the correctness of an X25519 key exchange implementation.


# Data Structures

---
### fd\_x25519\_verify\_wycheproof
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `comment`: A pointer to a constant character string, typically used for comments or descriptions.
    - `shared`: An array of 32 unsigned characters, representing the shared secret.
    - `prv`: An array of 32 unsigned characters, representing the private key.
    - `pub`: An array of 32 unsigned characters, representing the public key.
    - `tc_id`: An unsigned integer representing the test case identifier.
    - `ok`: An integer indicating the success or failure of the verification.
- **Description**: The `fd_x25519_verify_wycheproof` structure is designed to hold data related to the verification of X25519 key exchange operations, specifically for use with Wycheproof test vectors. It includes fields for storing a comment, the shared secret, private and public keys, a test case identifier, and a status indicator for the verification result.

### fd\_x25519\_verify\_wycheproof\_t
- **Type**: `typedef struct`
- **Description**: The `fd_x25519_verify_wycheproof_t` is a typedef for a structure named `fd_x25519_verify_wycheproof`. This suggests that it is likely used to encapsulate data or functionality related to verifying X25519 cryptographic operations, possibly in the context of Wycheproof, which is a project that provides test vectors for cryptographic algorithms. However, without additional details on the structure's fields or implementation, the specific purpose and usage of this data structure cannot be fully determined.
