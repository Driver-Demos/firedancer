# Purpose
This C header file defines an API for performing X25519 Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key exchange, as specified in RFC 7748 Section 5. It provides two main functions: [`fd_x25519_public`](#fd_x25519_public), which generates a public key from a 32-byte private key, and `fd_x25519_exchange`, which computes a shared secret using a private key and a peer's public key. The file ensures secure key exchange by allowing two parties to derive a shared secret without revealing their private keys. The header also includes necessary macros and function prototypes, and it handles potential security issues, such as low order curve points, by zeroing out the shared secret in case of failure.

### fd\_x25519\_public
- **Type**: `function`
- **Description**: The `fd_x25519_public` function generates an X25519 public key (curve point) from a given 32-byte secret key. It takes two parameters: `self_public_key`, a pointer to a memory region of at least 32 bytes where the generated public key will be stored, and `self_private_key`, a constant pointer to the 32-byte secret key used for the generation. The function returns the `self_public_key` pointer, which now contains the serialized public key suitable for network sharing.
- **Use**: This function is used to derive a public key from a private key for use in the X25519 ECDH key exchange process.
