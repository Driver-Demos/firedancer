# Purpose
This C source code file implements cryptographic operations related to the X25519 elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key exchange protocol. The code provides functions for performing scalar multiplication on the Montgomery form of the curve, which is a critical operation in the X25519 protocol used for secure key exchange. The file includes functions such as [`fd_x25519_scalar_mul_const_time`](#FD_FN_SENSITIVEfd_x25519_scalar_mul_const_time), `fd_x25519_public`, and `fd_x25519_exchange`, which are used to compute public keys and shared secrets in a constant-time manner to prevent timing attacks. The code is optimized for different hardware capabilities, with conditional compilation directives to leverage AVX and AVX-512 vector instructions for performance improvements when available.

The file defines both low-level operations, such as the Montgomery ladder algorithm for scalar multiplication, and higher-level functions that adhere to the specifications outlined in RFC 7748. It ensures constant-time execution for sensitive operations to enhance security. The code also includes mechanisms to handle non-canonical values and mask certain bits of the scalar to comply with the X25519 specification. The file is intended to be part of a larger cryptographic library, as indicated by the inclusion of headers like "fd_x25519.h" and "fd_f25519.h", and it provides a focused set of functionalities specifically for the X25519 protocol, without defining a broad public API or external interfaces.

# Global Variables

---
### fd\_x25519\_basepoint
- **Type**: ``static const uchar[32]``
- **Description**: The `fd_x25519_basepoint` is a static constant array of 32 unsigned characters, initialized with the value 9. It is aligned according to the `FD_X25519_ALIGN` macro, which ensures proper memory alignment based on the system's capabilities.
- **Use**: This variable is used as the base point in X25519 elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman key exchange operations.


# Functions

---
### fd\_x25519\_is\_zero\_const\_time<!-- {{#callable:FD_FN_SENSITIVE::fd_x25519_is_zero_const_time}} -->
The function `fd_x25519_is_zero_const_time` checks if a 32-byte array is entirely zero in a constant-time manner.
- **Inputs**:
    - `point`: A constant 32-byte array of type `uchar` that represents the point to be checked for zero.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize an integer `is_zero` to 1, which will be used to track if all bytes are zero.
    - Iterate over each byte in the `point` array from index 0 to 31.
    - For each byte, perform a logical AND operation between `is_zero` and the negation of the byte value, updating `is_zero`.
    - Return the value of `is_zero`, which will be 1 if all bytes are zero, otherwise 0.
- **Output**: An integer that is 1 if all bytes in the input array are zero, otherwise 0.

### fd\_x25519\_montgomery\_ladder<!-- {{#callable:FD_FN_SENSITIVE::fd_x25519_montgomery_ladder}} -->
The `fd_x25519_montgomery_ladder` function performs the Montgomery ladder algorithm for scalar multiplication on the X25519 elliptic curve, using a secret scalar and a point on the curve.
- **Inputs**:
    - `x2`: A pointer to an `fd_f25519_t` structure where the resulting x-coordinate of the scalar multiplication will be stored.
    - `z2`: A pointer to an `fd_f25519_t` structure where the resulting z-coordinate of the scalar multiplication will be stored.
    - `x1`: A constant pointer to an `fd_f25519_t` structure representing the x-coordinate of the input point on the curve.
    - `secret_scalar`: A constant pointer to an array of unsigned characters representing the secret scalar used for the scalar multiplication.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize variables and pack the input point `x1` into the `U` and `Q` structures.
    - Iterate over each bit of the `secret_scalar` from the most significant to the least significant bit (254 to 0).
    - For each bit, compute the swap value and conditionally swap the coordinates using the `wwl_permute` function.
    - Perform a series of arithmetic operations to compute the intermediate values `A`, `B`, `C`, `D`, `E`, `F`, `G`, `H`, and `GG` using the `FD_R43X6_QUAD_*` macros.
    - Update the `Q` structure with the new values of `x_2`, `z_2`, `x_3`, and `z_3`.
    - After the loop, perform a final conditional swap based on the last swap value.
    - Unpack the final results into `x2` and `z2`.
    - Clear sensitive data from memory using `fd_memset_explicit` to prevent information leakage.
- **Output**: The function outputs the x and z coordinates of the resulting point after scalar multiplication, stored in the `x2` and `z2` structures, respectively.

- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize two `fd_f25519_t` variables `x2` and `z2` to store intermediate results.
    - Call [`fd_x25519_montgomery_ladder`](#FD_FN_SENSITIVEfd_x25519_montgomery_ladder) to perform the scalar multiplication using the Montgomery ladder technique, storing results in `x2` and `z2`.
    - Compute the modular inverse of `z2` using `fd_f25519_inv`.
    - Multiply `x2` by the inverse of `z2` to obtain the final x-coordinate of the result.
