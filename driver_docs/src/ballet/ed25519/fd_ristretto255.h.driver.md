# Purpose
The provided C header file, `fd_ristretto255.h`, defines a public API for operations on the Ristretto255 group, which is a prime order group derived from Curve25519. This API is specifically designed for use within the Solana virtual machine's syscall `sol_curve_group_op`, and it ensures stability across different backend implementations, such as reference or AVX. The file includes essential operations for handling Ristretto255 group elements, such as setting, adding, subtracting, and validating points, as well as compressing and decompressing them. It also provides functions for checking equality and negation of group elements, and for mapping hash outputs to curve points.

The header file is structured to ensure that operations on Ristretto255 group elements are distinct from those on Ed25519 elements, despite using the same underlying data type. It achieves this by defining type aliases and macros that map Ristretto255 operations to their Ed25519 counterparts, while also providing additional functions specific to Ristretto255, such as [`fd_ristretto255_point_eq`](#fd_ristretto255_point_eq) and [`fd_ristretto255_point_eq_neg`](#fd_ristretto255_point_eq_neg). The file also includes functions for hashing to the curve and mapping to the curve, which are crucial for cryptographic applications that require random oracle behavior or internal mappings. Overall, this header file serves as a comprehensive interface for cryptographic operations involving the Ristretto255 group, ensuring compatibility and stability within the specified context.

The function does not handle null pointers, so both the buffer and the group element pointer must be non-null.
- **Inputs**:
    - `buf`: A buffer of at least 32 bytes where the compressed form of the group element will be stored. The caller must ensure this buffer is allocated and non-null.
    - `h`: A pointer to a valid fd_ristretto255_point_t representing the group element to be compressed. The pointer must be non-null and point to a properly initialized group element.
- **Output**: Returns the pointer to the buffer containing the 32-byte compressed form of the group element.
