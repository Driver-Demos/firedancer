# Purpose
The provided C source code file implements functions for working with the Ristretto255 group, a prime-order group based on the Edwards25519 curve. This code is part of a cryptographic library that provides functionality for encoding and decoding points on the Ristretto255 curve, as well as mapping and hashing data to the curve. The file includes functions such as [`fd_ristretto255_point_frombytes`](#fd_ristretto255_point_frombytes) and [`fd_ristretto255_point_tobytes`](#fd_ristretto255_point_tobytes), which handle the conversion of byte arrays to and from Ristretto255 points, ensuring that only canonical points are accepted. Additionally, the file implements the Elligator2 map and a hash-to-curve function, which are used to map arbitrary data to points on the curve in a way that is indistinguishable from random points.

The technical components of this file include operations on finite field elements (fd_f25519_t) and various mathematical transformations necessary for the Ristretto255 encoding and decoding processes. The code relies on functions for arithmetic operations in the finite field, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and inversion, as well as specific operations like square roots and conditional selection. The file is not an executable on its own but is intended to be part of a larger cryptographic library, providing essential functions for applications that require secure and efficient elliptic curve operations. The functions defined in this file form a crucial part of the public API for interacting with the Ristretto255 group, enabling developers to perform cryptographic operations with strong security guarantees.

### fd\_ristretto255\_point\_frombytes<!-- {{#callable:fd_ristretto255_point_frombytes}} -->
The function `fd_ristretto255_point_frombytes` converts a 32-byte array into a Ristretto255 point, ensuring the point is canonical and valid.
- **Inputs**:
    - `h`: A pointer to an `fd_ristretto255_point_t` structure where the resulting point will be stored.
    - `buf`: A constant 32-byte array representing the encoded point to be converted.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Convert the 32-byte input `buf` into a field element `s` using `fd_f25519_frombytes`.
    - Convert `s` back to bytes and compare with `buf` to ensure the point is canonical; return `NULL` if not.
    - Compute `ss` as the square of `s`, then calculate `u1` as `1 - ss` and `u2` as `1 + ss`.
    - Square `u2` to get `u2sq`, then compute `v` as `-(D * u1^2) - u2sq`.
    - Calculate the inverse square root of `v * u2sq` to determine if `v` is a square, storing the result in `inv_sq`.
    - Compute `den_x` as `inv_sq * u2` and `den_y` as `inv_sq * den_x * v`.
    - Calculate `x` as the absolute value of `2 * s * den_x`, `y` as `u1 * den_y`, and `t` as `x * y`.
    - Check if the point is valid by ensuring `was_square` is true, `t` is non-negative, and `y` is non-zero; return `NULL` if any condition fails.
    - If valid, convert the calculated coordinates into an `fd_ristretto255_point_t` using `fd_ed25519_point_from` and return it.
- **Output**: Returns a pointer to the `fd_ristretto255_point_t` structure containing the converted point, or `NULL` if the input does not represent a valid canonical point.
