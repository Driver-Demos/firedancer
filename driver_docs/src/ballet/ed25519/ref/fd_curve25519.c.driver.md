# Purpose
This C source code file provides functionality for operations on elliptic curve points, specifically for the Curve25519 and Ed25519 elliptic curves. The file includes functions for point addition, subtraction, doubling, and conversion between different representations of elliptic curve points. The primary focus is on optimizing these operations for performance, particularly in the context of scalar multiplication, which is a common operation in cryptographic algorithms. The functions `fd_ed25519_point_add_with_opts` and `fd_ed25519_point_sub_with_opts` allow for optional optimizations based on the properties of the input points, such as whether a point is in affine form or precomputed, which can save computational resources by reducing the number of multiplications required.

The file also includes functions for serializing and deserializing elliptic curve points, as well as converting points to and from affine coordinates. These operations are crucial for cryptographic protocols that require efficient and secure handling of elliptic curve points. The code is structured to be part of a larger library, as indicated by the inclusion of a header file and the use of inline functions for performance-critical operations. The functions defined in this file are likely intended to be used as part of a cryptographic library that implements the Ed25519 signature scheme or similar protocols, providing a robust and efficient foundation for elliptic curve arithmetic.

# Functions

### fd\_ed25519\_point\_add<!-- {{#callable:fd_ed25519_point_add}} -->
The `fd_ed25519_point_add` function computes the sum of two Ed25519 elliptic curve points and returns the result.
- **Inputs**:
    - `r`: A pointer to an `fd_ed25519_point_t` structure where the result of the addition will be stored.
    - `a`: A constant pointer to an `fd_ed25519_point_t` structure representing the first point to be added.
    - `b`: A constant pointer to an `fd_ed25519_point_t` structure representing the second point to be added.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function `fd_ed25519_point_add` is a wrapper that calls `fd_ed25519_point_add_with_opts` with default options (all set to 0).
    - The `fd_ed25519_point_add_with_opts` function performs the actual addition of the two points `a` and `b` on the Ed25519 curve.
    - It uses several temporary variables to perform arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, and multiplication on the coordinates of the points.
    - The function checks for optimizations based on the options provided, such as whether `b->Z` is one, whether `b` is precomputed, and whether to skip the last multiplication step.
    - The result of the addition is stored in the point `r`, which is then returned.
- **Output**: A pointer to the `fd_ed25519_point_t` structure `r` containing the result of the addition.

### fd\_ed25519\_point\_sub<!-- {{#callable:fd_ed25519_point_sub}} -->
The `fd_ed25519_point_sub` function computes the subtraction of two Ed25519 points and returns the result.
- **Inputs**:
    - `r`: A pointer to an `fd_ed25519_point_t` structure where the result of the subtraction will be stored.
    - `a`: A constant pointer to an `fd_ed25519_point_t` structure representing the first point in the subtraction.
    - `b`: A constant pointer to an `fd_ed25519_point_t` structure representing the second point in the subtraction.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function calls `fd_ed25519_point_sub_with_opts` with the provided points `a` and `b`, and the result pointer `r`.
    - It passes additional parameters `0, 0, 0` to `fd_ed25519_point_sub_with_opts`, indicating no special options are used for optimization.

    - `a`: A constant pointer to an `fd_ed25519_point_t` structure representing the point to be doubled.
- **Control Flow**:
    - A temporary `fd_ed25519_point_t` structure `t` is declared to hold intermediate results.
    - The function `fd_ed25519_partial_dbl` is called with `t` and `a` to perform the partial doubling operation, which uses squaring instead of multiplication as per the reference paper.
    - The function `fd_ed25519_point_add_final_mul` is called with `r` and `t` to complete the doubling operation and store the result in `r`.
