# Purpose
The provided C code defines a data structure and initializes a set of test vectors specifically for verifying the Ed25519 digital signature scheme. Each test vector is represented as a structure containing fields such as a test case ID (`tc_id`), a descriptive comment, a message (`msg`) with its size (`msg_sz`), a signature (`sig`), a public key (`pub`), and an `ok` flag indicating the expected outcome of the signature verification (1 for success, 0 for failure). This code is not an executable program or library but serves as a collection of test data used in conjunction with a cryptographic library or test framework to validate the correctness of Ed25519 signature implementations. The test vectors are crucial for ensuring the reliability and security of cryptographic operations by providing predefined inputs and expected outputs, allowing automated testing of the signature verification process. The code does not define public APIs or external interfaces, but rather functions as an internal dataset for testing purposes, with the `ok` field providing a clear pass/fail criterion for each test case.

### ed25519\_verify\_cctvs
- **Type**: ``fd_ed25519_verify_cctv_t[]``
- **Description**: The `ed25519_verify_cctvs` is a static constant array of type `fd_ed25519_verify_cctv_t`, which holds multiple test cases for verifying Ed25519 signatures. Each element in the array represents a test case with fields such as `tc_id`, `comment`, `msg`, `msg_sz`, `sig`, `pub`, and `ok`, which store the test case ID, a comment, the message, message size, signature, public key, and the expected verification result, respectively.
- **Use**: This array is used to store test vectors for verifying the correctness of Ed25519 signature verification implementations.


# Data Structures

### fd\_ed25519\_verify\_cctv
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `comment`: A pointer to a constant character string for storing comments.
    - `msg`: A pointer to a constant unsigned character array representing the message to be verified.
    - `msg_sz`: An unsigned long integer representing the size of the message.
    - `pub`: An array of 32 unsigned characters representing the public key.
    - `sig`: An array of 64 unsigned characters representing the signature.
    - `tc_id`: An unsigned integer representing the test case identifier.
    - `ok`: An integer indicating the verification result, typically 1 for success and 0 for failure.
- **Description**: The `fd_ed25519_verify_cctv` structure is designed to encapsulate all necessary components for verifying an Ed25519 signature. It includes pointers to the message and a comment, the size of the message, arrays for the public key and signature, a test case identifier, and a verification result flag. This structure is likely used in cryptographic operations to ensure the integrity and authenticity of messages using the Ed25519 digital signature algorithm.

### fd\_ed25519\_verify\_cctv\_t
- **Type**: `typedef struct`
- **Description**: The `fd_ed25519_verify_cctv_t` is a forward declaration of a structure in C, indicating that the actual definition of the structure is provided elsewhere in the code. This structure is likely used for handling operations related to the verification of Ed25519 signatures, possibly in a context involving closed-circuit television (CCTV) systems, as suggested by its name. However, without the full definition, the specific fields and their purposes within the structure remain unspecified.
