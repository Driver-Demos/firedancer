# Purpose
The file is a Makefile snippet used in a build system. It defines a library target named `fd_ballet` and specifies header files `fd_ballet_base.h` and `fd_ballet.h` to be included in the build process. The `make-lib` and `add-hdrs` are likely macros or functions that facilitate the library creation and header file management.
