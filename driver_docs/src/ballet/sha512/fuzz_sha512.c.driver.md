# Purpose
This C source code file is designed to perform fuzz testing on the SHA-512 hashing functionality, specifically focusing on both single message hashing and batch message hashing. The code is structured to be used with LLVM's libFuzzer, as indicated by the presence of the [`LLVMFuzzerInitialize`](#LLVMFuzzerInitialize) and [`LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`](#LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput) functions. The primary purpose of this file is to ensure the robustness and correctness of the SHA-512 implementation by subjecting it to a variety of inputs, potentially including malformed or unexpected data, to identify any vulnerabilities or unexpected behavior.

The file includes several key components: it initializes the fuzzing environment, sets up necessary configurations, and defines the logic for hashing both individual and multiple messages. The `fd_sha512` and `fd_sha512_batch` functions are used to compute hashes, and assertions are employed to verify that the computed hashes match expected results. The code also includes mechanisms to handle batch processing of messages, dividing the input data into smaller chunks and verifying the integrity of each hashed output. This file is not intended to be a standalone executable but rather a component of a larger testing framework, leveraging the functionality provided by the included headers and libraries.

# Global Variables

---
### batch\_sha
- **Type**: `fd_sha512_batch_t[1]`
- **Description**: The `batch_sha` variable is a static array of type `fd_sha512_batch_t` with a single element. It is used to manage the state of a batch SHA-512 hashing operation.
- **Use**: This variable is used to initialize, add messages to, and finalize a batch SHA-512 hashing process.


---
### hash1
- **Type**: `uchar array`
- **Description**: The `hash1` variable is a static array of unsigned characters with a size defined by `FD_SHA512_HASH_SZ`. It is used to store the result of a SHA-512 hash operation.
- **Use**: `hash1` is used to store the hash result of a single message processed by the `fd_sha512_fini` function.


---
### hash2
- **Type**: `uchar array`
- **Description**: The `hash2` variable is a static array of unsigned characters with a size defined by `FD_SHA512_HASH_SZ`. It is used to store the SHA-512 hash of a single message.
- **Use**: `hash2` is used to store the result of the `fd_sha512_hash` function, which computes the SHA-512 hash of the input data.


---
### ref\_hash
- **Type**: `uchar array`
- **Description**: The `ref_hash` is a static array of unsigned characters with a size defined by `FD_SHA512_HASH_SZ`, which represents the size of a SHA-512 hash. It is used to store a reference hash value for comparison purposes during batch hashing operations.
- **Use**: `ref_hash` is used to store the result of a SHA-512 hash computation for comparison against other hash values to ensure correctness.


---
### hash\_mem
- **Type**: `uchar array`
- **Description**: The `hash_mem` variable is a static array of unsigned characters with a size determined by the product of `FD_SHA512_HASH_SZ` and `BATCH_CNT`. It is used to store the hash results for a batch of messages processed by the SHA-512 hashing algorithm.
- **Use**: `hash_mem` is used to allocate memory for storing the hash outputs of multiple messages in a batch processing context.


---
### hashes
- **Type**: `uchar *`
- **Description**: The `hashes` variable is a static array of pointers to unsigned characters, with a size defined by the constant `BATCH_CNT`. Each element in the array is intended to point to a memory location where a SHA-512 hash result is stored.
- **Use**: This variable is used to store the results of batch SHA-512 hash computations, with each pointer in the array pointing to a different hash result.


---
### messages
- **Type**: `char const *[BATCH_CNT]`
- **Description**: The `messages` variable is a static array of constant character pointers, with a size defined by the macro `BATCH_CNT`. It is used to store pointers to the start of each message segment within a batch of data to be hashed.
- **Use**: This variable is used to hold the starting addresses of message segments for batch processing in SHA-512 hashing operations.


---
### msg\_sizes
- **Type**: `ulong array`
- **Description**: The `msg_sizes` variable is a static array of unsigned long integers with a size defined by the constant `BATCH_CNT`, which is set to 32. This array is used to store the sizes of individual messages in a batch for SHA-512 hashing operations.
- **Use**: `msg_sizes` is used to keep track of the size of each message in a batch during the batch hashing process.


# Functions

---
### LLVMFuzzerInitialize<!-- {{#callable:LLVMFuzzerInitialize}} -->
The `LLVMFuzzerInitialize` function initializes the environment for fuzz testing by setting environment variables, bootstrapping the system, registering a cleanup function, and configuring logging behavior.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: A pointer to an integer representing the number of command-line arguments.
    - `argv`: A pointer to an array of strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Set the environment variable 'FD_LOG_BACKTRACE' to '0' to disable backtraces in logs.
    - Call `fd_boot` with `argc` and `argv` to perform system-specific initialization.
    - Register `fd_halt` to be called on program exit using `atexit`.
    - Set the core logging level to 3 using `fd_log_level_core_set`, which will cause the program to crash on warning logs.
    - Return 0 to indicate successful initialization.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer value of 0, indicating successful initialization.


---
### LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput<!-- {{#callable:LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput}} -->
The function `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` performs SHA-512 hashing on input data, both as a single message and in batches, to verify the integrity of the hashing process.
- **Inputs**:
    - `fuzz_data`: A pointer to the input data to be hashed.
    - `fuzz_sz`: The size of the input data in bytes.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize a SHA-512 context and hash the input data as a single message, storing the result in `hash1`.
    - Compute the SHA-512 hash of the input data directly into `hash2` and verify that `hash1` and `hash2` are identical.
    - If the input size is greater than or equal to `BATCH_CNT`, proceed with batch hashing.
    - Initialize a batch SHA-512 context and divide the input data into `BATCH_CNT` segments.
    - For each segment, compute its SHA-512 hash and store the result in the corresponding position in `hashes`.
    - Finalize the batch hashing process and verify that each batch hash matches the expected hash computed directly.
- **Output**: The function returns 0, indicating successful execution and verification of the hashing process.
