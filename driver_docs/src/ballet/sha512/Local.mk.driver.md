# Purpose
The provided content is a Makefile script used in a software build system to manage the compilation and testing of components related to SHA-512 and SHA-384 cryptographic functions. It utilizes conditional logic to include additional assembly and object files optimized for specific CPU instruction sets, such as AVX and AVX512, if they are available. The script defines unit tests for both SHA-512 and SHA-384, ensuring that these cryptographic functions are correctly implemented and function as expected. Additionally, if the environment supports hosted execution, it includes fuzz testing for these cryptographic functions to identify potential vulnerabilities or errors. This configuration ensures that the cryptographic components are robust, optimized, and thoroughly tested across different hardware capabilities.
