# Purpose
This assembly source code file is an implementation of the SHA-512 cryptographic hash function optimized for the x86_64 architecture using AVX2 instructions. The code is part of the OpenSSL project, a widely used open-source library for secure communications. The primary function defined in this file, `fd_sha512_core_avx2`, is responsible for performing the core operations of the SHA-512 algorithm, which involves processing blocks of data to produce a fixed-size hash value. The use of AVX2 instructions allows for efficient parallel processing, which enhances the performance of the hash computation on modern processors that support these instructions.

The file includes several key technical components, such as the use of AVX2 vector instructions for parallel data processing, and the manipulation of 64-bit registers to handle the 512-bit blocks of data that SHA-512 operates on. The code also includes a set of constants, `fd_sha512_core_avx2_k`, which are used in the SHA-512 algorithm's compression function. These constants are part of the algorithm's specification and are crucial for the correct transformation of input data into the hash output.

Overall, this file is a specialized component of a larger cryptographic library, providing a highly optimized implementation of the SHA-512 hash function. Its purpose is to offer a secure and efficient means of generating hash values, which are essential for data integrity verification, digital signatures, and other cryptographic applications. The use of assembly language and AVX2 instructions highlights the focus on performance optimization, making it suitable for high-throughput environments where cryptographic operations are a bottleneck.

### fd\_sha512\_core\_avx2\_k
- **Type**: ``@object``
- **Description**: The `fd_sha512_core_avx2_k` is a global variable defined as an object in the assembly code. It contains a series of 64-bit constants (quadwords) that are used in the SHA-512 hashing algorithm. These constants are part of the K array, which is a set of predefined values used in the SHA-512 compression function to perform bitwise operations and transformations on the input data.
- **Use**: This variable is used within the SHA-512 core function to perform cryptographic transformations on data using AVX2 instructions.
