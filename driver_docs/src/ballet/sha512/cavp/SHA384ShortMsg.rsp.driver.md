# Purpose
This file is a test vector file for the SHA-384 cryptographic hash function, used to verify the correctness of SHA-384 implementations. It is a configuration file that provides a series of test cases, each consisting of a message of varying lengths (denoted by "Len" and "Msg") and their corresponding SHA-384 hash outputs (denoted by "MD"). The file is structured to test byte-oriented implementations of SHA-384, ensuring that the hash function produces the expected output for a given input. The relevance of this file to a codebase lies in its use for validating the integrity and correctness of cryptographic functions, which is crucial for security-related software development. The file's contents are organized into a series of test cases, each representing a different input message length, providing comprehensive coverage for testing the hash function's behavior across a wide range of input sizes.
# Content Summary
This file is a test vector configuration for the SHA-384 cryptographic hash function, specifically for short message testing. It is part of the Cryptographic Algorithm Validation System (CAVS) version 11.0, which is used to validate the implementation of cryptographic algorithms. The file contains a series of test cases, each specifying a message of varying lengths and their corresponding SHA-384 hash outputs.

Key technical details include:

1. **Message Length (Len):** Each test case specifies the length of the message in bits. The lengths range from 0 to 1024 bits, increasing in increments of 8 bits.

2. **Message (Msg):** The message is represented in hexadecimal format. It is the input data for which the SHA-384 hash is computed.

3. **Message Digest (MD):** This is the expected output of the SHA-384 hash function for the given message. It is also represented in hexadecimal format.

4. **Byte-Oriented Implementation:** The tests are configured for byte-oriented implementations, meaning the input messages are processed as sequences of bytes.

5. **Purpose:** The primary purpose of this file is to provide a set of known inputs and expected outputs to verify the correctness of SHA-384 implementations. Developers can use these test vectors to ensure their cryptographic libraries produce the correct hash values for given inputs.

This file is crucial for developers working on cryptographic software, as it provides a reliable means to validate the accuracy and compliance of their SHA-384 implementations with established standards.
