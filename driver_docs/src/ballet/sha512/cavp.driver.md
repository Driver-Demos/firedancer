- **[SHA384ShortMsg.rsp](cavp/SHA384ShortMsg.rsp.driver.md)**: The `SHA384ShortMsg.rsp` file in the `firedancer` codebase contains test vectors for the SHA-384 hash function, specifically for short messages, as part of the CAVP (Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Program) testing suite.
- **[SHA512Monte.rsp](cavp/SHA512Monte.rsp.driver.md)**: The `SHA512Monte.rsp` file in the `firedancer` codebase contains test vectors for the "SHA-512 Monte" test, which is part of the CAVS 11.1 suite, providing a series of message digests generated from a given seed for byte-oriented SHA-512 implementations.
