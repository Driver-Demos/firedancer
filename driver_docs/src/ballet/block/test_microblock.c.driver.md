# Purpose
This C source code file is a simple validation script designed to perform static assertions on the layout of a data structure, specifically `fd_microblock_hdr_t`, which is presumably defined in the included header file "fd_microblock.h". The static assertions ensure that the size of the structure is exactly 48 bytes (0x30UL) and that specific fields within the structure, such as `hash_cnt`, `hash`, and `txn_cnt`, are located at precise offsets. The [`main`](#main) function initializes the environment with `fd_boot`, logs a "pass" message if the assertions hold, and then gracefully shuts down with `fd_halt`. This script is likely used during development to verify that the memory layout of the structure matches expected specifications, which is crucial for ensuring compatibility and correctness in systems where binary data formats are involved.
# Imports and Dependencies

- `fd_microblock.h`
- `stddef.h`


# Functions

---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function initializes the program, logs a notice, and then halts execution.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The count of command-line arguments passed to the program.
    - `argv`: An array of strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Call `fd_boot` with pointers to `argc` and `argv` to perform initial setup.
    - Log a notice message 'pass' using `FD_LOG_NOTICE`.
    - Call `fd_halt` to terminate the program.
    - Return 0 to indicate successful execution.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer value of 0, indicating successful execution.
