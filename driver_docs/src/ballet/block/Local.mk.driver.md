# Purpose
The file is a Makefile snippet used for automating the build and test process of a software project. It includes a header file `fd_microblock.h` using a custom function `add-hdrs`, defines a unit test `test_microblock` with dependencies on `fd_ballet` and `fd_util` using `make-unit-test`, and executes the unit test with `run-unit-test`.
