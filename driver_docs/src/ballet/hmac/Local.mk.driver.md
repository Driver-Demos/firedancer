# Purpose
This file is a Makefile script used for building and testing components related to HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code) functionality. It defines rules to add header files and object files, create and run a unit test named `test_hmac`, and conditionally create a fuzz test named `fuzz_hmac` if the `FD_HAS_HOSTED` environment variable is set.
