# Purpose
This C source code file is designed to be used as a fuzz testing harness for HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code) implementations using SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512 hashing algorithms. The file is structured to integrate with LLVM's libFuzzer, a popular fuzzing engine, as indicated by the presence of the [`LLVMFuzzerInitialize`](#LLVMFuzzerInitialize) and [`LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`](#LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput) functions. The primary purpose of this code is to test the robustness and correctness of the HMAC implementations by feeding them with a variety of input data, including edge cases and unexpected inputs, to ensure they handle all scenarios gracefully without crashing or producing incorrect results.

The code includes several key components: it initializes the fuzzing environment, sets up logging and error handling, and defines a structure `hmac_test` to represent test cases. The [`LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`](#LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput) function is the core of the fuzzing process, where it extracts the key and message from the input data, computes the HMAC using different SHA algorithms, and verifies the consistency of the results. The use of assertions ensures that any deviation from expected behavior is immediately flagged, facilitating the identification of potential bugs. This file is not intended to be a standalone executable but rather a component of a larger testing framework, leveraging external utilities and libraries for logging, error handling, and cryptographic operations.

# Data Structures

---
### hmac\_test
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `key_sz`: Represents the size of the key in bytes.
    - `key`: An array of unsigned characters representing the key used in HMAC operations.
- **Description**: The `hmac_test` structure is designed to facilitate HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code) testing by storing a key size and a flexible array member for the key itself. This structure is used in conjunction with HMAC functions to verify the integrity and authenticity of messages by computing hash values using different algorithms like SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512. The `key_sz` member indicates the length of the key, while the `key` array holds the actual key data, allowing for dynamic sizing based on the specific test case requirements.

### hmac\_test\_t
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `key_sz`: Stores the size of the key in bytes.
    - `key`: A flexible array member to hold the key data.
- **Description**: The `hmac_test_t` structure is designed to facilitate HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code) testing by storing a key size and a flexible array for the key itself. This structure is used in fuzz testing to ensure the integrity and correctness of HMAC implementations with various hash functions like SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512. The flexible array member allows for dynamic sizing of the key, making it adaptable for different test cases.


# Functions

---
### LLVMFuzzerInitialize<!-- {{#callable:LLVMFuzzerInitialize}} -->
The `LLVMFuzzerInitialize` function initializes the environment for fuzz testing by setting environment variables, bootstrapping the system, registering an exit handler, and configuring logging levels.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: A pointer to the argument count, typically passed to main functions in C programs.
    - `argv`: A pointer to the argument vector, typically passed to main functions in C programs, representing the command-line arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Set the environment variable 'FD_LOG_BACKTRACE' to '0' to disable backtraces in logs.
    - Call `fd_boot` with `argc` and `argv` to perform system-specific initialization.
    - Register `fd_halt` to be called on program exit using `atexit`.
    - Set the core logging level to 3 using `fd_log_level_core_set`, which will cause the program to crash on warning logs.
    - Return 0 to indicate successful initialization.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer value of 0, indicating successful initialization.


---
### LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput<!-- {{#callable:LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput}} -->
The function `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` tests HMAC implementations by verifying that the same input data produces consistent hash outputs across multiple hash functions.
- **Inputs**:
    - `data`: A pointer to an array of unsigned characters representing the input data, which includes the key and message for HMAC testing.
    - `size`: An unsigned long integer representing the size of the input data array.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if the input size is less than 64 bytes; if so, return -1.
    - Cast the input data to an `hmac_test_t` structure to access the key size and key data.
    - Calculate the actual key size by masking with `KEY_MAX-1UL` and check if the total size is sufficient; if not, return -1.
    - Determine the key and message pointers based on the calculated sizes.
    - Initialize two arrays `hash1` and `hash2` to store hash results, ensuring they are 64-byte aligned.
    - Compute HMAC-SHA256 for the message and key, storing results in `hash1` and `hash2`, and assert that the results are identical.
    - Repeat the HMAC computation and comparison for SHA384 and SHA512 hash functions.
    - Ensure that the fuzzing coverage requirement is met with `FD_FUZZ_MUST_BE_COVERED`.
    - Return 0 to indicate successful execution.
- **Output**: The function returns 0 on successful execution, or -1 if the input size is insufficient for processing.
