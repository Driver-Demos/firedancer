## Files
- **[fd_elf.h](elf/fd_elf.h.driver.md)**: The `fd_elf.h` file in the `firedancer` codebase defines constants and functions related to the Executable and Linking Format (ELF), including types, flags, and a function to read C-style strings from a buffer.
- **[fd_elf64.h](elf/fd_elf64.h.driver.md)**: The `fd_elf64.h` file in the `firedancer` codebase defines structures for handling ELF64 file types, including headers, segments, sections, symbols, relocations, and dynamic section entries.
- **[Local.mk](elf/Local.mk.driver.md)**: The `Local.mk` file in the `firedancer` codebase specifies the headers and unit test setup for the ELF component, including `fd_elf.h`, `fd_elf64.h`, and the `test_elf` unit test.
- **[test_elf.c](elf/test_elf.c.driver.md)**: The `test_elf.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase performs sanity checks and binary compatibility assertions for ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) structures and definitions, and includes tests for reading C-style strings from a predefined character array.
