## Files
- **[fd_murmur3.c](murmur3/fd_murmur3.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_murmur3.c` file implements the MurmurHash3 algorithm for generating a 32-bit hash from input data.
- **[fd_murmur3.h](murmur3/fd_murmur3.h.driver.md)**: The `fd_murmur3.h` file provides APIs for computing Murmur3-32 hashes and includes functions for hashing program counters and their inverses in the `firedancer` codebase.
- **[Local.mk](murmur3/Local.mk.driver.md)**: The `Local.mk` file in the `firedancer` codebase specifies the build configuration for the `murmur3` module, including header and object files, as well as unit test creation and execution.
- **[test_murmur3.c](murmur3/test_murmur3.c.driver.md)**: The `test_murmur3.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase contains test vectors and benchmarking code for the Murmur3 hash function, including tests for correctness and performance measurements for various input sizes and hash functions.
