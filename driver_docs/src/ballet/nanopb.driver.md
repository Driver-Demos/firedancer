## Files
- **[fetch.sh](nanopb/fetch.sh.driver.md)**: The `fetch.sh` file in the `firedancer` codebase is a Bash script that downloads specific files from a specified version of the `nanopb` repository and modifies the include statements in those files.
- **[Local.mk](nanopb/Local.mk.driver.md)**: The `Local.mk` file in the `firedancer` codebase specifies header and object files for the `fd_ballet` component, including `pb_firedancer.h`, `pb_common.h`, `pb_decode.h`, `pb_encode.h`, and `pb.h`.
- **[nanopb_tag.txt](nanopb/nanopb_tag.txt.driver.md)**: The `nanopb_tag.txt` file specifies the version of the nanopb library being used, which is 0.4.9.1.
- **[pb.h](nanopb/pb.h.driver.md)**: The `pb.h` file in the `firedancer` codebase provides low-level components and configuration options for the nanopb library, which is used for encoding and decoding Protocol Buffers in C.
- **[pb_common.c](nanopb/pb_common.c.driver.md)**: The `pb_common.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase provides common support functions for encoding and decoding protocol buffers, including functions for iterating over fields, handling extensions, and validating UTF-8 strings.
- **[pb_common.h](nanopb/pb_common.h.driver.md)**: The `pb_common.h` file in the `firedancer` codebase provides common support functions for field iteration and extension handling in Protocol Buffers encoding and decoding, primarily used by `pb_encode.c` and `pb_decode.c`.
- **[pb_decode.c](nanopb/pb_decode.c.driver.md)**: The `pb_decode.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase provides functionality for decoding Protocol Buffers (protobuf) messages using minimal resources, with support for various data types, extensions, and memory management options.
- **[pb_decode.h](nanopb/pb_decode.h.driver.md)**: The `pb_decode.h` file in the `firedancer` codebase provides functions and structures for decoding protocol buffers, including the main `pb_decode` function and support for custom input streams and various decoding options.
- **[pb_encode.c](nanopb/pb_encode.c.driver.md)**: The `pb_encode.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase provides functionality for encoding Protocol Buffers (protobuf) messages using minimal resources, including various helper functions and encoding strategies for different data types and field configurations.
- **[pb_encode.h](nanopb/pb_encode.h.driver.md)**: The `pb_encode.h` file in the `firedancer` codebase provides functions and structures for encoding protocol buffers, including main encoding functions, stream manipulation, and helper functions for writing field callbacks.
- **[pb_firedancer.h](nanopb/pb_firedancer.h.driver.md)**: The `pb_firedancer.h` file in the `firedancer` codebase sets up preprocessor directives and includes necessary headers for using nanopb with specific configurations, such as enabling 32-bit fields and malloc support.
- **[README.txt](nanopb/README.txt.driver.md)**: The `README.txt` file in the `firedancer/src/ballet/nanopb` directory explains that it contains an unmodified copy of the Nanopb library C source code from tag "nanopb-0.4.9.1" and provides instructions for updating and licensing information.
