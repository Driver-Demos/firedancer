# Purpose
This file is a configuration file used for cryptographic testing, specifically for the SHA-256 hash function, as part of a Monte Carlo simulation. The file is structured to provide a series of test cases, each identified by a "COUNT" and associated with a "MD" (Message Digest) value, which represents the output of the SHA-256 hash function for a given input. The "Seed" value is used as the initial input for the hash function, and the subsequent "MD" values are generated iteratively based on the previous hash output. This file provides narrow functionality, focusing solely on the validation and testing of the SHA-256 implementation, ensuring its correctness and reliability. The relevance of this file to a codebase lies in its role in verifying the integrity and security of cryptographic operations, which are critical for applications that require secure data handling and transmission.
# Content Summary
This file is a configuration document for a cryptographic test suite, specifically for the SHA-256 hash function, as part of the Cryptographic Algorithm Validation System (CAVS) version 11.1. The file is structured to provide test data for a "SHA-256 Monte Carlo" test, which is a type of test used to validate the implementation of the SHA-256 algorithm in a byte-oriented manner. The document was generated on May 11, 2011.

The file begins with a header that specifies the length of the hash output (`L = 32`), which corresponds to the 256-bit output of the SHA-256 algorithm. It also includes a seed value, which is a hexadecimal string used as the initial input for the hash function in the Monte Carlo test. The seed is crucial as it ensures the reproducibility of the test results.

Following the seed, the file contains a series of test cases, each identified by a `COUNT` value ranging from 0 to 99. Each test case consists of a `MD` (Message Digest) value, which is the expected output of the SHA-256 hash function for that particular iteration. These message digests are also represented as hexadecimal strings.

The purpose of this file is to provide a set of known inputs and expected outputs that can be used to verify the correctness of a SHA-256 implementation. Developers working with this file should focus on ensuring that their implementation produces the same message digest values for each corresponding count when using the provided seed. This validation process is essential for confirming the reliability and security of cryptographic software.
