# Purpose
This assembly source code file is designed to implement a high-performance SHA-256 hashing function using the SHA extension instructions available on modern x86_64 processors. The code is a specialized and optimized version of the SHA-256 algorithm, which is a cryptographic hash function widely used for data integrity and security. The file's primary function, `fd_sha256_core_shaext`, processes blocks of data to compute the SHA-256 hash, leveraging the processor's SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) capabilities through XMM registers and specific SHA-256 instructions like `sha256rnds2`, `sha256msg1`, and `sha256msg2`.

The code is a focused implementation that extracts only the necessary components for SHA extension acceleration, making it highly efficient for environments where performance is critical. It uses a modern 64-bit x86_64 calling convention and interfaces with an existing library API, ensuring compatibility and ease of integration into larger systems. The use of Intel op codes instead of byte code enhances readability and maintainability, as modern assemblers can directly interpret these instructions.

The file is not a collection of disparate components but rather a cohesive implementation of a single cryptographic function. The common theme is the optimization of the SHA-256 hashing process, achieved by utilizing advanced processor features to accelerate computation. This makes the code particularly suitable for applications requiring fast and secure data hashing, such as digital signatures, data integrity checks, and secure communications.
# Global Variables

---
### fd\_sha256\_core\_shaext\_Kmask
- **Type**: `@object`
- **Description**: The `fd_sha256_core_shaext_Kmask` is a global variable defined as an object type in the assembly code. It is a constant array of 272 bytes, containing a sequence of 64-bit integers. These integers are the SHA-256 constants used in the SHA-256 hash computation process, specifically optimized for SHA extension acceleration.
- **Use**: This variable is used in the SHA-256 computation loop to provide the necessary constants for the SHA-256 rounds, enhancing performance with SHA extension instructions.


# Subroutines

---
### fd\_sha256\_core\_shaext
The `fd_sha256_core_shaext` function performs SHA-256 hashing using Intel's SHA extensions for accelerated processing of data blocks.
- **Inputs**:
    - `state`: A pointer to the current state of the SHA-256 hash, stored in the `rdi` register.
    - `block`: A pointer to the data block to be hashed, stored in the `rsi` register.
    - `block_cnt`: The number of 64-byte blocks to process, stored in the `rdx` register.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function begins by calculating the end address of the data to be processed by multiplying `block_cnt` by 64 and adding it to `block`, storing the result in `rdx`.
    - It loads the initial hash state from `state` into XMM registers for processing.
    - The function enters a loop (`.L003loop_shaext`) that processes each 64-byte block of data using Intel's SHA extensions, performing multiple rounds of SHA-256 operations.
    - Within the loop, it uses a series of `movdqu`, `pshufb`, `sha256rnds2`, `sha256msg1`, and `sha256msg2` instructions to perform the SHA-256 transformations on the data.
    - The loop continues until all blocks have been processed, as determined by comparing the current block pointer `rsi` with the calculated end address `rdx`.
    - After exiting the loop, the function updates the hash state in `state` with the results from the XMM registers.
    - Finally, the function returns, completing the SHA-256 hashing process.
- **Output**: The function updates the `state` with the new hash value after processing the specified number of data blocks.
