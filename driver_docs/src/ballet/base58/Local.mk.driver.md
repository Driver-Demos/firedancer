# Purpose
This file is a Makefile snippet used to define build rules for a software project. It specifies the inclusion of header files, object files, and unit tests related to Base58 functionality, and conditionally includes fuzz tests if the `FD_HAS_HOSTED` environment variable is set. The `call` function is used to modularize the addition of these components into the build process.
