# Purpose
The provided C source code file is designed to handle Base58 encoding and decoding operations, which are commonly used in applications like Bitcoin addresses and other cryptocurrency systems. The file includes conditional compilation to support AVX (Advanced Vector Extensions) for optimized performance on compatible hardware. It defines lookup tables and constants necessary for converting between binary data and Base58-encoded strings. The `base58_chars` array maps indices to Base58 characters, while the `base58_inverse` array provides a reverse mapping for decoding purposes. These mappings facilitate efficient encoding and decoding processes, with special handling for invalid characters to ensure robustness.

The file also includes precomputed tables (`enc_table_32`, `dec_table_32`, `enc_table_64`, and `dec_table_64`) that are used to optimize the conversion process for different data sizes, specifically 32-byte and 64-byte binary data. These tables contain values that help in the mathematical transformation required for Base58 encoding and decoding, allowing for efficient computation without repeated calculations. The inclusion of `fd_base58_tmpl.c` suggests that this file is part of a larger codebase where template-based code generation or inclusion is used to handle different scenarios or configurations. Overall, this file provides a focused and efficient implementation of Base58 encoding and decoding, with considerations for performance optimizations on modern hardware.

# Global Variables

---
### base58\_chars
- **Type**: ``char const[]``
- **Description**: The `base58_chars` array is a static constant character array that contains the characters used in the Base58 encoding scheme. Base58 is a binary-to-text encoding scheme that is commonly used in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin to encode large numbers in a compact and human-readable format. The array includes characters from '1' to '9', 'A' to 'Z' (excluding 'I', 'O'), and 'a' to 'z' (excluding 'l').
- **Use**: This variable is used to map indices to their corresponding Base58 characters for encoding purposes.


---
### base58\_inverse
- **Type**: `uchar const[]`
- **Description**: The `base58_inverse` is a constant array of unsigned characters that maps character values offset by '1' to their corresponding base58 indices. Invalid base58 characters are mapped to a special value defined as `BASE58_INVALID_CHAR`. This array is used to facilitate branchless lookups for base58 decoding.
- **Use**: This variable is used to decode base58 encoded strings by mapping characters to their respective base58 indices.


---
### enc\_table\_32
- **Type**: ``static uint const enc_table_32[BINARY_SZ][INTERMEDIATE_SZ-1UL]``
- **Description**: The `enc_table_32` is a static constant two-dimensional array of unsigned integers used in encoding operations. It contains precomputed values that are used to map binary data to a base58 representation. The array is structured to facilitate efficient encoding by providing unique values less than 58^5, which are used in calculations involving powers of 58 and 2.
- **Use**: This variable is used to perform base58 encoding by providing precomputed values for efficient conversion of binary data.


---
### dec\_table\_32
- **Type**: `uint const`
- **Description**: The `dec_table_32` is a static constant two-dimensional array of unsigned integers. It is used to store precomputed values that are less than 2^32, which are used in the conversion process between base58 and binary representations. The array dimensions are defined by `INTERMEDIATE_SZ` and `BINARY_SZ`, which are calculated based on the size of the data being processed.
- **Use**: This variable is used in the decoding process of base58 encoded data to binary format.


---
### enc\_table\_64
- **Type**: ``static uint const enc_table_64[BINARY_SZ][INTERMEDIATE_SZ-1UL]``
- **Description**: The `enc_table_64` is a static constant two-dimensional array of unsigned integers. It is used to store unique values less than 58^5, which are calculated such that 2^(32*(15-j)) equals the sum of the table's elements multiplied by 58^(5*(16-k)). This table is specifically designed for encoding operations involving 64-byte binary data.
- **Use**: This variable is used in encoding processes to map binary data to a base58 representation.


---
### dec\_table\_64
- **Type**: ``static uint const dec_table_64[INTERMEDIATE_SZ][BINARY_SZ]``
- **Description**: The `dec_table_64` is a static constant two-dimensional array of unsigned integers used in the base58 decoding process. It contains precomputed values that are used to convert base58 encoded data back into its original binary form. The table is structured to facilitate efficient decoding by mapping powers of 58 to powers of 2, which is essential for handling 64-byte binary data.
- **Use**: This variable is used in the base58 decoding algorithm to map base58 encoded values back to their original binary representation.
