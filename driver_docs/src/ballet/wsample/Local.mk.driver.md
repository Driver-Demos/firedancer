# Purpose
The file is a Makefile snippet used for building and testing components in a software project. It defines build rules by adding headers and object files, specifically `fd_wsample.h` and objects `fd_wsample` and `fd_ballet`. It also specifies the creation and execution of a unit test named `test_wsample`, which depends on `fd_ballet` and `fd_util`.
