## Files
- **[fd_deshredder.c](shred/fd_deshredder.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_deshredder.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase implements functions to initialize and process a deshredder, which consumes and processes data shreds into a buffer.
- **[fd_deshredder.h](shred/fd_deshredder.h.driver.md)**: The `fd_deshredder.h` file defines the `fd_deshredder_t` structure and functions for deserializing a vector of shreds into block entries within the Firedancer codebase.
- **[fd_fec_set.h](shred/fd_fec_set.h.driver.md)**: The `fd_fec_set.h` file defines the structure and components of a Forward Error Correction (FEC) set used in the Firedancer project, which includes handling data and parity shreds for transmission and reception.
- **[fd_shred.c](shred/fd_shred.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_shred.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase provides functions for parsing and validating shreds, as well as computing their Merkle roots.
- **[fd_shred.h](shred/fd_shred.h.driver.md)**: The `fd_shred.h` file in the `firedancer` codebase defines the structure and functions for handling "shreds," which are the on-wire representation of Solana block data optimized for transmission over unreliable networks, including features like Merkle inclusion proofs and Reed-Solomon error correction.
- **[fuzz_shred_parse.c](shred/fuzz_shred_parse.c.driver.md)**: The `fuzz_shred_parse.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase implements a fuzz testing harness for parsing and validating different types of shreds, including checks for bounds and specific shred properties.
- **[Local.mk](shred/Local.mk.driver.md)**: The `Local.mk` file in the `firedancer` codebase specifies the headers, object files, unit tests, and conditional fuzz tests for the shred and deshredder components within the `fd_ballet` module.
- **[test_deshredder.c](shred/test_deshredder.c.driver.md)**: The `test_deshredder.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase tests the functionality of the deshredder by reading, parsing, and processing shreds from binary archives to verify the integrity and correctness of the deshredded content.
- **[test_shred.c](shred/test_shred.c.driver.md)**: The `test_shred.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase contains unit tests for verifying the parsing and validation of different types of shreds, including legacy and merkle variants, by checking their properties and ensuring correct type detection and size calculations.
