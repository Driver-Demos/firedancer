# Purpose
The file is a Makefile script used for building and testing components in a software project. It defines build rules by adding header files (`fd_poh.h`) and object files (`fd_poh`, `fd_ballet`) to the build process. It also specifies the creation and execution of a unit test named `test_poh`, which depends on the `fd_ballet` and `fd_util` components.
