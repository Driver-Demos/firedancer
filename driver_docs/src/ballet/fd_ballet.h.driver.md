# Purpose
This code is a C header file that serves as an inclusion guard and a centralized point for including various cryptographic and data processing modules. The file uses preprocessor directives to prevent multiple inclusions, ensuring that the header's contents are only processed once during compilation. It includes headers for different cryptographic algorithms and data structures, such as Ed25519 for digital signatures, SHA-256 and SHA-512 for hashing, and Blake3 for fast hashing. Additionally, it includes modules for Proof of History (PoH) and Merkle tree operations, which are often used in blockchain and data integrity applications. This header file is likely part of a larger cryptographic or blockchain-related library, providing essential cryptographic functionalities and data structures.
