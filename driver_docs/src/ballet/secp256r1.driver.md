## Files
- **[fd_secp256r1.c](secp256r1/fd_secp256r1.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_secp256r1.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase implements the verification of ECDSA signatures using the secp256r1 curve.
- **[fd_secp256r1.h](secp256r1/fd_secp256r1.h.driver.md)**: The `fd_secp256r1.h` file provides APIs for verifying secp256r1 signatures, including a function to verify a signature using a message, signature, public key, and SHA-256 context.
- **[fd_secp256r1_private.h](secp256r1/fd_secp256r1_private.h.driver.md)**: The `fd_secp256r1_private.h` file defines data structures and constants for secp256r1 elliptic curve operations, including field elements, scalar field elements, and points in Jacobian coordinates, as part of the Firedancer codebase.
- **[fd_secp256r1_s2n.c](secp256r1/fd_secp256r1_s2n.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_secp256r1_s2n.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase provides functions for operations on scalars, field elements, and points in the secp256r1 elliptic curve, including scalar multiplication, inversion, and point conversion from bytes.
- **[fd_secp256r1_table.c](secp256r1/fd_secp256r1_table.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_secp256r1_table.c` file in the Firedancer codebase contains a static array of precomputed hexadecimal values, specifically a table of multiples of the base point for the Secp256r1 elliptic curve, used to optimize elliptic curve cryptography operations by reducing repeated calculations.
- **[Local.mk](secp256r1/Local.mk.driver.md)**: The `Local.mk` file in the `firedancer` codebase is a makefile that conditionally includes headers, objects, and unit tests for `secp256r1` based on the presence of `FD_HAS_S2NBIGNUM`, otherwise issuing a warning if `s2n-bignum` is not available.
- **[test_secp256r1.c](secp256r1/test_secp256r1.c.driver.md)**: The `test_secp256r1.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase contains a series of tests and benchmarks for various secp256r1 elliptic curve operations, including scalar and point conversions, multiplication, inversion, square root calculations, and signature verification.
