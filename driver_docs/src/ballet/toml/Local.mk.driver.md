# Purpose
This file is a Makefile snippet used for building a software project. It defines build rules by adding headers and object files, specifically `fd_toml.h` and objects `fd_toml` and `fd_ballet`. Additionally, it conditionally includes a fuzz test target `fuzz_toml` if the `FD_HAS_HOSTED` variable is set, incorporating dependencies on `fd_ballet` and `fd_util`.
