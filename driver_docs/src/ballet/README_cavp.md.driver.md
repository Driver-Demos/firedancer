# Purpose
The provided content is a documentation snippet for a module that includes test vectors from the NIST Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Program (CAVP). These test vectors are used to validate implementations of cryptographic algorithms recommended by NIST, specifically focusing on the SHA-2 family of hash functions, such as SHA-256 and SHA-512, as outlined in FIPS 180-4. The document lists the SHA-256 checksums for each test vector file, ensuring the integrity and authenticity of the files by allowing users to verify that the content has not been altered. Additionally, it provides references to official NIST resources for further information and usage guidelines, such as the Secure Hash Algorithm Validation System (SHAVS) documentation. This ensures that developers and cryptographers can reliably test and validate their cryptographic implementations against standardized benchmarks.
