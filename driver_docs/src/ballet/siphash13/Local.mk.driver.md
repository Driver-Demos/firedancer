# Purpose
The file is a Makefile script used for building and testing components related to the `fd_siphash13` module. It defines rules to add headers and object files, create and run a unit test named `test_siphash13`, and conditionally create a fuzz test `fuzz_siphash13` if the `FD_HAS_HOSTED` variable is defined.
