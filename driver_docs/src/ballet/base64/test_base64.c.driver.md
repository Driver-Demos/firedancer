# Purpose
This C source code file is designed to test and benchmark Base64 encoding and decoding functionality. It includes a main function that executes a series of unit tests and performance benchmarks to verify the correctness and efficiency of Base64 operations. The file defines a structure, `fd_base64_test_vec_t`, to hold test vectors, which are used to validate the encoding and decoding processes against known outputs. The test vectors include both valid and intentionally corrupted Base64 strings to ensure the robustness of the decoding function. The code also includes a throughput test to measure the performance of the decoding function in terms of gigabits per second and nanoseconds per byte.

The file is structured to be an executable test suite rather than a library or header file intended for reuse in other programs. It imports functionality from external files, `fd_base64.h` and `fd_ballet.h`, which likely contain the actual Base64 encoding and decoding implementations. The code uses logging and error-checking macros, such as `FD_TEST` and `FD_LOG_ERR`, to report the results of the tests and any errors encountered. The inclusion of a random number generator setup and teardown suggests that the tests may involve some stochastic elements, although the specific role of randomness is not detailed in the provided code. Overall, this file serves as a comprehensive test harness for ensuring the reliability and performance of Base64 operations.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `fd_base64.h`
- `../fd_ballet.h`


# Global Variables

---
### test\_long\_raw
- **Type**: `uchar const[]`
- **Description**: The `test_long_raw` variable is a static constant array of unsigned characters (uchar) that contains a sequence of 65 hexadecimal values. These values represent a raw data buffer used for testing purposes.
- **Use**: This variable is used as a test vector for verifying the correctness of Base64 encoding and decoding functions.


---
### test\_vector
- **Type**: ``fd_base64_test_vec_t const` array`
- **Description**: The `test_vector` is a static constant array of `fd_base64_test_vec_t` structures, which are used to verify the correctness of Base64 encoding and decoding functions. Each element in the array contains a pair of raw data and its corresponding Base64 encoded string, along with their respective lengths. The array is terminated by an entry with `raw_len` set to `ULONG_MAX`, indicating the end of the test cases.
- **Use**: This variable is used in unit tests to validate the Base64 encoding and decoding functions by comparing the results against known correct values.


---
### test\_corrupt
- **Type**: ``char const * const[]``
- **Description**: The `test_corrupt` variable is a static array of constant character pointers, each pointing to a string that represents a corrupted or invalid Base64 encoded sequence. The array is terminated with a NULL pointer to indicate the end of the list.
- **Use**: This variable is used to store test cases for invalid Base64 encoded strings, which are then used to verify that the Base64 decoding function correctly identifies and handles errors.


# Data Structures

---
### fd\_base64\_test\_vec
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `raw_len`: Stores the length of the raw data.
    - `raw`: Pointer to the raw data string.
    - `enc_len`: Stores the length of the encoded data.
    - `enc`: Pointer to the encoded data string.
- **Description**: The `fd_base64_test_vec` structure is designed to hold a pair of raw and Base64 encoded data along with their respective lengths. It is used to verify the correctness of Base64 encoding and decoding operations by providing a set of test vectors that include both the original data and its encoded form. This structure facilitates testing by allowing easy comparison between expected and actual results during encoding and decoding processes.


---
### fd\_base64\_test\_vec\_t
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `raw_len`: Stores the length of the raw data in bytes.
    - `raw`: Pointer to the raw data to be encoded or decoded.
    - `enc_len`: Stores the length of the encoded Base64 data in bytes.
    - `enc`: Pointer to the encoded Base64 data.
- **Description**: The `fd_base64_test_vec_t` structure is designed to hold test vectors for verifying Base64 encoding and decoding operations. It contains fields for both the raw data and its corresponding Base64 encoded representation, along with their respective lengths. This structure is used in unit tests to ensure the correctness of Base64 encoding and decoding functions by comparing expected results with actual outcomes.


# Functions

---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function initializes the environment, performs unit tests and benchmarks for Base64 encoding and decoding, and logs the results.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments passed to the program.
    - `argv`: An array of strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize the environment using `fd_boot` with command-line arguments.
    - Create and join a random number generator using `fd_rng_new` and `fd_rng_join`.
    - Iterate over a predefined test vector to perform unit tests for Base64 decoding and encoding, verifying the results with `FD_TEST`.
    - Iterate over a list of corrupt Base64 strings to ensure decoding fails as expected, logging an error if it does not.
    - Perform a throughput test by decoding a large Base64 string multiple times, first as a warmup and then for measurement.
    - Calculate and log the decoding throughput in Gbps and time per byte in nanoseconds.
    - Clean up the random number generator and log a success message before halting the program.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer value of 0, indicating successful execution.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`fd_base64_decode`](fd_base64.c.driver.md#fd_base64_decode)
    - [`fd_base64_encode`](fd_base64.c.driver.md#fd_base64_encode)
