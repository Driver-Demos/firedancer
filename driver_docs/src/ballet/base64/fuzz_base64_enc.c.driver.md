# Purpose
This C source code file is designed to perform fuzz testing on Base64 encoding and decoding functions. The primary purpose of the code is to verify that the process of encoding data into Base64 and then decoding it back to its original form is an identity operation, meaning the output should match the input exactly. The code achieves this by using a fuzzer, which is a tool that automatically generates random data inputs to test the robustness and correctness of the encoding and decoding functions. The file includes necessary headers and utility functions, such as `fd_base64_encode` and `fd_base64_decode`, to perform these operations. It also uses assertions to ensure that the encoded and decoded sizes are as expected and that the decoded data matches the original input.

The code is structured to be used with a fuzzing framework, as indicated by the presence of [`LLVMFuzzerInitialize`](#LLVMFuzzerInitialize) and [`LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`](#LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput) functions. These functions are standard entry points for fuzz testing with LLVM's libFuzzer. The [`LLVMFuzzerInitialize`](#LLVMFuzzerInitialize) function sets up the environment by disabling certain signal handlers and configuring logging behavior, while [`LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`](#LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput) performs the actual testing of the Base64 functions. The code is not intended to be a standalone executable but rather a component of a larger testing suite, focusing specifically on the reliability and correctness of Base64 encoding and decoding operations.

# Functions

---
### LLVMFuzzerInitialize<!-- {{#callable:LLVMFuzzerInitialize}} -->
The `LLVMFuzzerInitialize` function initializes the environment for fuzz testing by setting environment variables, bootstrapping the system, and configuring logging behavior.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: A pointer to the argument count, typically passed to main functions in C programs.
    - `argv`: A pointer to the argument vector, typically passed to main functions in C programs, representing the command-line arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Set the environment variable 'FD_LOG_BACKTRACE' to '0' to disable backtrace logging.
    - Call `fd_boot` with `argc` and `argv` to perform system bootstrapping.
    - Register `fd_halt` to be called at program exit using `atexit`.
    - Set the core logging level to 3 using `fd_log_level_core_set`, which will cause the program to crash on warning logs.
    - Return 0 to indicate successful initialization.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer value of 0, indicating successful initialization.


---
### LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput<!-- {{#callable:LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput}} -->
The function `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` tests the integrity of base64 encoding and decoding by ensuring that decoding the encoded data returns the original input data.
- **Inputs**:
    - `data`: A pointer to the input data to be encoded and decoded.
    - `data_sz`: The size of the input data in bytes.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Calculate the size required for base64 encoding using `FD_BASE64_ENC_SZ` and allocate memory for the encoded data.
    - Encode the input data using [`fd_base64_encode`](fd_base64.c.driver.md#fd_base64_encode) and assert that the encoded size matches the expected size.
    - Calculate the size required for base64 decoding using `FD_BASE64_DEC_SZ` and assert that it is within the expected range.
    - Allocate memory for the decoded data and decode the encoded data using [`fd_base64_decode`](fd_base64.c.driver.md#fd_base64_decode).
    - Assert that the decoded size is non-negative, within the expected range, and matches the original data size.
    - Compare the decoded data with the original input data to ensure they are identical.
    - Free the allocated memory for both encoded and decoded data.
    - Invoke `FD_FUZZ_MUST_BE_COVERED` to ensure code coverage requirements are met.
    - Return 0 to indicate successful execution.
- **Output**: The function returns 0 to indicate successful execution and verification of the base64 encoding and decoding process.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`fd_base64_encode`](fd_base64.c.driver.md#fd_base64_encode)
    - [`fd_base64_decode`](fd_base64.c.driver.md#fd_base64_decode)
