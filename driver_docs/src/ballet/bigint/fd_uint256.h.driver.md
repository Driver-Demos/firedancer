# Purpose
This C header file provides a specialized implementation for handling 256-bit unsigned integers, encapsulated in the `fd_uint256_t` type. The file defines a union to represent a 256-bit integer as either an array of four `ulong` values or a buffer of 32 bytes, which is particularly useful for operations on little-endian platforms. The header ensures that instances of `fd_uint256_t` are aligned to 32 bytes, optimizing memory usage when multiple instances are used in a structure. This alignment consideration is crucial for performance, especially on architectures like AVX512, where misalignment can lead to inefficient memory access.

The file includes several inline functions that provide essential operations on 256-bit integers. These include byte-swapping ([`fd_uint256_bswap`](#fd_uint256_bswap)) for endian conversion, equality checking ([`fd_uint256_eq`](#fd_uint256_eq)), comparison ([`fd_uint256_cmp`](#fd_uint256_cmp)), and bit extraction ([`fd_uint256_bit`](#fd_uint256_bit)). These functions are designed to be efficient and are likely intended for use in performance-critical applications where large integer arithmetic is required. The inclusion of `fd_uint256_mul.h` suggests that multiplication operations are also supported, although the details are not provided in this file. Overall, this header file is part of a broader library for big integer arithmetic, providing a focused and efficient interface for 256-bit unsigned integer operations.

# Data Structures

---
### fd\_uint256\_t
- **Type**: `union`
- **Members**:
    - `limbs`: An array of 4 unsigned long integers representing the 256-bit integer in 64-bit chunks.
    - `buf`: A buffer of 32 unsigned characters representing the 256-bit integer as a byte array.
- **Description**: The `fd_uint256_t` is a union data structure designed to represent a 256-bit unsigned integer. It provides two views of the data: as an array of four 64-bit unsigned long integers (`limbs`) and as a 32-byte buffer (`buf`). This design allows for efficient manipulation and storage of large integers, particularly in environments where alignment and space optimization are critical. The union is aligned to 32 bytes to ensure efficient memory usage, especially when used in arrays or structures. The data structure is equipped with utility functions for byte swapping, comparison, and bit manipulation, making it versatile for various computational tasks involving large integers.


# Functions

---
### fd\_uint256\_bswap<!-- {{#callable:fd_uint256_bswap}} -->
The `fd_uint256_bswap` function performs a byte swap on a 256-bit unsigned integer, effectively reversing the byte order of its four 64-bit limbs.
- **Inputs**:
    - `r`: A pointer to an `fd_uint256_t` structure where the result of the byte swap will be stored.
    - `a`: A constant pointer to an `fd_uint256_t` structure representing the 256-bit unsigned integer to be byte-swapped.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function begins by byte-swapping each of the four 64-bit limbs of the input `fd_uint256_t` structure `a` using the `fd_ulong_bswap` function.
    - The swapped values are stored in local variables `r3`, `r2`, `r1`, and `r0`, corresponding to the original limbs `a->limbs[0]`, `a->limbs[1]`, `a->limbs[2]`, and `a->limbs[3]` respectively.
    - The function then assigns these swapped values to the limbs of the result `fd_uint256_t` structure `r` in reverse order, effectively reversing the byte order of the entire 256-bit integer.
    - Finally, the function returns the pointer `r` to the caller.
- **Output**: A pointer to the `fd_uint256_t` structure `r` containing the byte-swapped result.


---
### fd\_uint256\_eq<!-- {{#callable:fd_uint256_eq}} -->
The `fd_uint256_eq` function checks if two 256-bit unsigned integers are equal by comparing their respective 64-bit limbs.
- **Inputs**:
    - `a`: A pointer to the first 256-bit unsigned integer (fd_uint256_t) to be compared.
    - `b`: A pointer to the second 256-bit unsigned integer (fd_uint256_t) to be compared.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function compares the first limb (64 bits) of both integers.
    - It then compares the second limb of both integers.
    - Next, it compares the third limb of both integers.
    - Finally, it compares the fourth limb of both integers.
    - If all corresponding limbs are equal, the function returns true (1); otherwise, it returns false (0).
- **Output**: The function returns an integer: 1 if the two 256-bit integers are equal, and 0 if they are not.


---
### fd\_uint256\_cmp<!-- {{#callable:fd_uint256_cmp}} -->
The `fd_uint256_cmp` function compares two 256-bit unsigned integers and returns 0 if they are equal, -1 if the first is less than the second, and 1 if the first is greater than the second.
- **Inputs**:
    - `a`: A pointer to the first `fd_uint256_t` structure representing a 256-bit unsigned integer.
    - `b`: A pointer to the second `fd_uint256_t` structure representing a 256-bit unsigned integer.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function iterates over the `limbs` array of the `fd_uint256_t` structures from the most significant limb (index 3) to the least significant limb (index 0).
    - For each limb, it checks if the corresponding limbs of `a` and `b` are not equal.
    - If a difference is found, it returns 1 if the limb of `a` is greater than the limb of `b`, otherwise it returns -1.
    - If no differences are found after checking all limbs, it returns 0, indicating that `a` and `b` are equal.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer: 0 if the two 256-bit integers are equal, -1 if the first is less than the second, and 1 if the first is greater than the second.


---
### fd\_uint256\_bit<!-- {{#callable:fd_uint256_bit}} -->
The `fd_uint256_bit` function retrieves the value of the i-th bit from a 256-bit unsigned integer represented by `fd_uint256_t`.
- **Inputs**:
    - `a`: A pointer to a `fd_uint256_t` structure representing a 256-bit unsigned integer.
    - `i`: An integer representing the index of the bit to retrieve, where 0 is the least significant bit.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Calculate the index of the limb (64-bit segment) containing the desired bit by dividing `i` by 64.
    - Calculate the position of the bit within the limb by taking `i` modulo 64.
    - Retrieve the limb from the `a->limbs` array using the calculated limb index.
    - Shift 1 left by the bit position within the limb to create a mask.
    - Perform a bitwise AND between the limb and the mask to isolate the desired bit.
    - Return the result of the bitwise AND operation, which will be either 0 or a non-zero value depending on whether the bit is set.
- **Output**: The function returns an `ulong` which is non-zero if the i-th bit is set, and zero if it is not.
