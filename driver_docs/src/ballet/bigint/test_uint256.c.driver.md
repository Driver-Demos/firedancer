# Purpose
This C source code file is a test script designed to verify the functionality of the `fd_ulong_sub_borrow` function, which appears to perform subtraction with borrow for unsigned long integers. The script includes a static function, [`test_ulong_sub_borrow`](#test_ulong_sub_borrow), which conducts a series of test cases to ensure that the subtraction operation behaves correctly under various conditions, such as when subtracting zero, handling maximum unsigned long values, and managing borrow scenarios. The [`main`](#main) function initializes the test environment, executes the test function, and logs a success message if all tests pass. The code is structured to allow for additional test cases to be added, as indicated by the comment "TODO more checks here," suggesting that further validation is anticipated.

### test\_ulong\_sub\_borrow<!-- {{#callable:test_ulong_sub_borrow}} -->
The function `test_ulong_sub_borrow` tests the behavior of the `fd_ulong_sub_borrow` function by verifying its output for various input cases.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - Declare variables `r` (ulong) and `b` (int) to store the result and borrow flag respectively.
    - Call `fd_ulong_sub_borrow` with different sets of inputs and use `FD_TEST` to assert that the results and borrow flags are as expected.
    - The first test checks subtraction of 0 from 0 with no initial borrow, expecting a result of 0 and no borrow.
    - The second test checks subtraction of 0 from ULONG_MAX with no initial borrow, expecting a result of ULONG_MAX and no borrow.
    - The third test checks subtraction of 1 from 0 with no initial borrow, expecting a result of ULONG_MAX and a borrow of 1.
    - The fourth test checks subtraction of 2 from 4 with an initial borrow of 1, expecting a result of 1 and no borrow.
    - The fifth test checks subtraction of 2 from 2 with an initial borrow of 1, expecting a result of ULONG_MAX and a borrow of 1.
- **Output**: The function does not return any value; it performs assertions to validate the behavior of `fd_ulong_sub_borrow`.

### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function initializes the program, runs a test on the `fd_ulong_sub_borrow` function, logs a success message, and then halts the program.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The count of command-line arguments passed to the program.
    - `argv`: An array of strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Call `fd_boot` with pointers to `argc` and `argv` to initialize the program environment.
    - Invoke [`test_ulong_sub_borrow`](#test_ulong_sub_borrow) to perform a series of tests on the `fd_ulong_sub_borrow` function.
    - Log a notice message indicating the tests passed using `FD_LOG_NOTICE`.
    - Call `fd_halt` to terminate the program execution.
    - Return 0 to indicate successful execution.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer value of 0, indicating successful execution.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`test_ulong_sub_borrow`](#test_ulong_sub_borrow)
