# Purpose
This C source code file is a comprehensive test suite for the BLAKE3 cryptographic hash function, specifically designed to validate the implementation of the BLAKE3 algorithm within a software library. The code includes a main function, indicating that it is an executable program. It performs a series of unit tests and benchmarks to ensure the correctness and performance of the BLAKE3 hashing operations. The file begins by including necessary headers and defining static assertions to verify the alignment and footprint of the BLAKE3 data structures, ensuring they meet expected specifications.

The core functionality of the code involves initializing, appending data to, and finalizing the BLAKE3 hash computation, both in single-shot and incremental modes. It uses predefined test vectors to compare the computed hash values against expected results, logging errors if discrepancies are found. Additionally, the code benchmarks the hashing performance over varying input sizes, reporting throughput and latency metrics. The file also includes memory management routines for creating and deleting BLAKE3 hash objects, as well as random number generation for testing purposes. Overall, this file serves as a critical component for validating the integrity and efficiency of the BLAKE3 implementation in the library.

# Functions

---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function initializes and tests the BLAKE3 hashing algorithm using predefined test vectors and measures its performance.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments.
    - `argv`: An array of command-line arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize the environment with `fd_boot` and set up a random number generator `rng`.
    - Verify alignment and footprint of BLAKE3 structures using `FD_TEST`.
    - Create a BLAKE3 object `obj` and join it to a BLAKE3 state `sha`.
    - Iterate over predefined test vectors to test single-shot and incremental hashing, comparing results with expected hashes.
    - Generate random data in `buf` and measure the performance of the BLAKE3 hashing algorithm over varying sizes.
    - Log performance metrics in terms of Gbps per core and ns per byte.
    - Clean up by leaving and deleting BLAKE3 and RNG objects, and log a success message before halting.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer `0` indicating successful execution.
