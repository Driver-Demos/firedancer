# Purpose
The file is a Makefile snippet used in a build system. It defines a rule to add the header file `fd_lthash.h` and specifies a unit test target `test_lthash`, which depends on the `fd_ballet` and `fd_util` components. The `add-hdrs` and `make-unit-test` are likely custom functions or macros used to streamline the build process.
