# Purpose
This C source code file is an implementation of arithmetic operations specifically designed for the secp256k1 elliptic curve, which is widely used in cryptographic applications such as Bitcoin. The file provides two primary functions: [`fiat_secp256k1_dettman_mul`](#fiat_secp256k1_dettman_mul) and [`fiat_secp256k1_dettman_square`](#fiat_secp256k1_dettman_square). These functions perform multiplication and squaring of field elements, respectively, within the finite field defined by the prime modulus \(2^{256} - 4294968273\). The code is optimized for 64-bit architectures and uses 128-bit integer types to handle intermediate calculations that exceed the standard 64-bit range. The operations are implemented using a technique known as Dettman multiplication, which is efficient for large integer arithmetic.

The file is intended to be used as part of a larger cryptographic library, providing low-level arithmetic operations that can be utilized by higher-level cryptographic protocols. It is designed to be included in other C programs, as indicated by the use of `static` and `inline` keywords, which suggest that these functions are meant to be compiled directly into the calling program rather than being part of a shared library. The code is highly specialized, focusing on the specific needs of elliptic curve cryptography, and does not define any public APIs or external interfaces beyond the two functions provided. The use of conditional compilation directives ensures compatibility with different compilers, and the code explicitly checks for a two's complement system, which is a common requirement for cryptographic computations.

### fiat\_secp256k1\_dettman\_mul<!-- {{#callable:fiat_secp256k1_dettman_mul}} -->
The function `fiat_secp256k1_dettman_mul` performs a multiplication of two 5-element arrays representing field elements in the secp256k1 curve, with modular reduction.
- **Inputs**:
    - `out1`: A 5-element array of uint64_t where the result of the multiplication will be stored.
    - `arg1`: A 5-element array of uint64_t representing the first field element to be multiplied.
    - `arg2`: A 5-element array of uint64_t representing the second field element to be multiplied.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize several variables of type `fiat_secp256k1_dettman_uint128` and `uint64_t` to store intermediate results.
    - Compute the product of the last elements of `arg1` and `arg2`, storing the result in `x1`, and split it into high (`x2`) and low (`x3`) 64-bit parts.
    - Calculate a series of intermediate products and sums involving elements of `arg1` and `arg2`, applying modular reduction using constants like `0x1000003d10` and `0x1000003d10000`.
    - Perform bitwise shifts and masks to extract and propagate carry bits across the intermediate results.
    - Store the final reduced results into the `out1` array, representing the product of `arg1` and `arg2` modulo the curve's prime.
- **Output**: The function outputs a 5-element array `out1` containing the result of the multiplication of `arg1` and `arg2`, reduced modulo the prime of the secp256k1 curve.
