## Files
- **[fd_uint256.h](bigint/fd_uint256.h.driver.md)**: The `fd_uint256.h` file in the `firedancer` codebase provides an implementation of a 256-bit unsigned integer, including functions for byte swapping, equality checking, comparison, and bit retrieval.
- **[fd_uint256_mul.h](bigint/fd_uint256_mul.h.driver.md)**: The `fd_uint256_mul.h` file in the `firedancer` codebase provides an implementation of Montgomery multiplication for 256-bit unsigned integers, including utility functions and optimizations for specific architectures, and is intended for use in various field arithmetic operations.
- **[Local.mk](bigint/Local.mk.driver.md)**: The `Local.mk` file in the `firedancer` codebase specifies the inclusion of headers and the setup and execution of a unit test for `fd_uint256` functionality.
- **[test_uint256.c](bigint/test_uint256.c.driver.md)**: The `test_uint256.c` file contains a test suite for verifying the behavior of the `fd_ulong_sub_borrow` function, which performs subtraction with borrow handling for unsigned long integers.
