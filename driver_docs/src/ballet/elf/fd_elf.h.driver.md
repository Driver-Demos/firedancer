# Purpose
This C header file, `fd_elf.h`, is designed to provide definitions and utilities related to the Executable and Linking Format (ELF), which is a common standard file format for executables, object code, shared libraries, and core dumps. The file defines a series of macros that represent various ELF-related constants, such as file types, machine types, section header types, and symbol types. These constants are crucial for interpreting the structure and contents of ELF files, making this header file a foundational component for any software that needs to parse or manipulate ELF files.

Additionally, the file includes a static inline function, [`fd_elf_read_cstr`](#fd_elf_read_cstr), which is used to validate and read a C-style string from a specified memory region. This function ensures that the string is within bounds and properly null-terminated, providing a safe way to handle string data within ELF files. The file also includes a sibling header, `fd_elf64.h`, which likely contains additional definitions and utilities specific to 64-bit ELF files. Overall, this header file serves as a specialized library for handling ELF file structures, offering both constant definitions and utility functions to facilitate ELF file manipulation and analysis.

# Functions

### fd\_elf\_read\_cstr<!-- {{#callable:fd_elf_read_cstr}} -->
The `fd_elf_read_cstr` function attempts to read a C-style string from a specified offset within a given memory buffer, ensuring the string is within bounds and does not exceed a maximum size.
- **Inputs**:
    - `buf`: A pointer to the memory buffer from which the C-style string is to be read.
    - `buf_sz`: The size of the memory buffer in bytes.
    - `off`: The offset within the buffer where the C-style string is expected to start.
    - `max_sz`: The maximum allowable size for the C-style string, including the null terminator.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if the offset `off` is greater than or equal to `buf_sz`; if so, return NULL as it is out-of-bounds.
    - Calculate the starting address of the string by adding the offset `off` to the base address of `buf`.
    - Determine the size of the string region as `buf_sz - off`.
    - Calculate the minimum of the string region size and `max_sz` to limit the string length to be checked.
    - Use `fd_cstr_nlen` to find the length of the string up to the calculated minimum size; if the length equals the minimum size, return NULL as the string is not properly null-terminated within bounds.
    - Return the pointer to the start of the string if all checks pass.
- **Output**: A pointer to the first byte of the C-style string within the buffer on success, or NULL on failure.
