# Purpose
This C source code file is designed to perform sanity checks and compatibility assertions for ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) structures, specifically for 64-bit ELF files on Linux systems. The file includes a series of static assertions to ensure that custom ELF definitions (`fd_elf64_*`) are binary compatible with the standard system ELF definitions (`Elf64_*`) provided by the `<elf.h>` header. These assertions verify that the constants, structure offsets, and sizes match between the custom and system definitions, ensuring that the custom ELF handling code can correctly interpret and manipulate ELF files in a manner consistent with the system's expectations.

Additionally, the file contains a [`main`](#main) function that serves as a test harness for the `fd_elf_read_cstr` function, which appears to be a utility for reading C-style strings from a specified location within a given buffer. The [`main`](#main) function initializes the environment, performs a series of tests on the `fd_elf_read_cstr` function using a predefined `haystack` buffer, and logs the results. This setup indicates that the file is both a compatibility checker for ELF structures and a test suite for verifying the correctness of ELF-related string reading functionality. The presence of `fd_boot` and `fd_halt` functions suggests that this code is part of a larger framework or library, likely related to ELF file processing or analysis.

# Functions

---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function initializes the environment, performs a series of tests on the [`fd_elf_read_cstr`](fd_elf.h.driver.md#fd_elf_read_cstr) function using a predefined string, logs a success message, and then halts the program.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The count of command-line arguments passed to the program.
    - `argv`: An array of strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Call `fd_boot` to initialize the environment with `argc` and `argv`.
    - Define a static character array `haystack` with a specific sequence of characters.
    - Perform a series of tests using `FD_TEST` to check the behavior of [`fd_elf_read_cstr`](fd_elf.h.driver.md#fd_elf_read_cstr) with various parameters, including edge cases like undersized and oversized needles, and out-of-bounds access.
    - Log a notice message 'pass' using `FD_LOG_NOTICE` if all tests pass.
    - Call `fd_halt` to terminate the program.
    - Return 0 to indicate successful execution.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer value of 0, indicating successful execution.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`fd_elf_read_cstr`](fd_elf.h.driver.md#fd_elf_read_cstr)
