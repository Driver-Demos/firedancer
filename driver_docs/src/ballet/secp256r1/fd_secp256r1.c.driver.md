# Purpose
The provided C code is a function implementation for verifying ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm) signatures using the secp256r1 curve, which is a widely used elliptic curve in cryptographic applications. The function [`fd_secp256r1_verify`](#fd_secp256r1_verify) takes a message, its size, a signature, a public key, and a SHA-256 context as inputs. It performs several key operations: deserializing the signature and public key, hashing the message using SHA-256, and executing the ECDSA verification process. The function ensures that the signature components meet specific criteria to prevent signature malleability, a common vulnerability in cryptographic systems. The function returns a success or failure status based on whether the signature is valid.

This code is part of a cryptographic library, as indicated by its inclusion of a private header file (`fd_secp256r1_private.h`). It provides a specific functionality focused on signature verification, which is a critical component in ensuring data integrity and authenticity in secure communications. The function does not define a public API or external interface directly but is likely intended to be used internally within a larger cryptographic framework or library. The use of specific data types and functions prefixed with `fd_secp256r1_` suggests a modular design, where this function is part of a broader suite of cryptographic operations related to the secp256r1 curve.

### fd\_secp256r1\_verify<!-- {{#callable:fd_secp256r1_verify}} -->
The `fd_secp256r1_verify` function verifies an ECDSA signature using the secp256r1 curve by deserializing the signature and public key, hashing the message, and performing elliptic curve operations to check the signature's validity.
- **Inputs**:
    - `msg`: A pointer to the message data that is being verified.
    - `msg_sz`: The size of the message data in bytes.
    - `sig`: A 64-byte array containing the ECDSA signature to be verified.
    - `public_key`: A 33-byte array containing the public key used for verification.
    - `sha`: A pointer to an `fd_sha256_t` structure used for SHA-256 hashing operations.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize scalar and point variables for signature and public key deserialization.
    - Deserialize the signature components `r` and `s` from the `sig` array, ensuring they meet specific conditions to prevent signature malleability.
    - Check if either `r` or `s` is zero, returning failure if true.
    - Deserialize the public key from the `public_key` array, returning failure if deserialization fails.
    - Hash the message using SHA-256 and convert the hash to a scalar `u1`.
    - Compute the modular inverse of `s`, then calculate `u1` and `u2` by multiplying with the inverse of `s`.
    - Perform a double scalar multiplication to compute a point `Rcmp` on the elliptic curve.
    - Check if the x-coordinate of `Rcmp` matches `r`, returning success if they match, otherwise return failure.
- **Output**: The function returns `FD_SECP256R1_SUCCESS` if the signature is valid and `FD_SECP256R1_FAILURE` if it is not.
