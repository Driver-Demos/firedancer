# Purpose
This is a Makefile snippet that conditionally includes and tests the secp256r1 elliptic curve functionality based on the presence of the `FD_HAS_S2NBIGNUM` flag. If the flag is set, it adds the header and object files for `fd_secp256r1`, sets up a unit test for `test_secp256r1`, and runs the test. If the flag is not set, it issues a warning indicating that secp256r1 is disabled due to the absence of the s2n-bignum library.
