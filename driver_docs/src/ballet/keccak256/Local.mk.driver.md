# Purpose
This file is a Makefile script used to automate the build process for a software project. It defines rules to add header files and object files related to the `fd_keccak256` module, and specifies the creation and execution of a unit test named `test_keccak256`. Additionally, it conditionally includes a fuzz test `fuzz_keccak256` if the `FD_HAS_HOSTED` environment variable is set.
