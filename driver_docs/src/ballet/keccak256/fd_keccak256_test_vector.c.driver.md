# Purpose
This C source code file defines a set of test vectors for the Keccak-256 hash function, which is a variant of the SHA-3 cryptographic hash function. The file is not intended to be compiled directly as an executable but rather serves as a data source for testing purposes. It contains a structure, `fd_keccak256_test_vector`, which holds a message, its size, and the corresponding hash output. The test vectors are precomputed using the OpenSSL implementation of Keccak-256 on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 system, and they are stored in an array of `fd_keccak256_test_vector_t` structures.

The primary purpose of this file is to provide a collection of known input-output pairs for verifying the correctness of a Keccak-256 hash function implementation. Each entry in the array represents a test case with a specific input message and its expected hash result. The file concludes with a terminating entry in the array, which is marked by a `NULL` message pointer and a hash filled with zeros. This setup is typical for test vector files, allowing developers to iterate over the array until the termination condition is met. The file does not define any public APIs or external interfaces; instead, it is meant to be included in a larger test suite where the test vectors can be used to validate the hash function's implementation.
# Global Variables

---
### fd\_keccak256\_test\_vector
- **Type**: ``fd_keccak256_test_vector_t const[]``
- **Description**: The `fd_keccak256_test_vector` is a static constant array of `fd_keccak256_test_vector_t` structures. Each element in the array represents a test vector for the Keccak-256 hash function, containing a message, its size, and the corresponding hash value. The array is terminated with a special entry where the message is `NULL`, indicating the end of the test vectors.
- **Use**: This variable is used to store predefined test vectors for verifying the correctness of a Keccak-256 hash function implementation.


# Data Structures

### fd\_keccak256\_test\_vector
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `msg`: A pointer to a constant character array representing the message to be hashed.
    - `sz`: An unsigned long integer representing the size of the message.
    - `hash`: An array of 32 unsigned characters representing the computed hash value.
- **Description**: The `fd_keccak256_test_vector` structure is designed to store test vectors for the Keccak-256 hash function. It contains a message (`msg`) to be hashed, the size (`sz`) of this message, and the resulting hash (`hash`) as a 32-byte array. This structure is used to verify the correctness of the Keccak-256 implementation by comparing the computed hash against known values.
