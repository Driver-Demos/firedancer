# Purpose
This C source code file is designed to be used as a fuzzing target for testing the robustness and correctness of hexadecimal encoding and decoding functions. It is structured to work with LLVM's libFuzzer, a popular fuzzing engine, and includes initialization and test functions specifically tailored for this purpose. The [`LLVMFuzzerInitialize`](#LLVMFuzzerInitialize) function sets up the environment by configuring logging and signal handling, ensuring that the fuzzing process can run without interruptions from signal handlers. The main testing function, [`LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`](#LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput), takes input data, checks its size, and processes it as a hexadecimal string. It decodes the input using a custom `fd_hex_decode` function and verifies the correctness of the encoding using the [`check_hex_encoding`](#check_hex_encoding) function. This function ensures that the input is a valid hexadecimal string and returns the appropriate size or index of the first invalid character.

The code is part of a larger system, as indicated by the inclusion of utility headers like `fd_util.h` and `fd_fuzz.h`, which likely provide additional functionality and support for fuzz testing. The file is not intended to be a standalone executable but rather a component that integrates with the fuzzing framework to test specific aspects of hexadecimal data handling. The use of macros such as `FD_HAS_HOSTED` and `FD_UNLIKELY` suggests that the code is designed to be portable and optimized for performance. The file does not define public APIs or external interfaces but instead focuses on internal testing logic to ensure the reliability of the hexadecimal encoding and decoding processes.

# Functions

---
### LLVMFuzzerInitialize<!-- {{#callable:LLVMFuzzerInitialize}} -->
The `LLVMFuzzerInitialize` function initializes the environment for fuzz testing by setting environment variables, bootstrapping the system, registering a cleanup function, and configuring logging behavior.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: A pointer to the argument count, typically passed to main functions in C programs.
    - `argv`: A pointer to the argument vector, an array of strings representing command-line arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Set the environment variable 'FD_LOG_BACKTRACE' to '0' to disable backtraces in logs.
    - Call `fd_boot` with `argc` and `argv` to perform system-specific initialization.
    - Register `fd_halt` to be called on program exit using `atexit`.
    - Set the core logging level to 3 using `fd_log_level_core_set`, which will cause the program to crash on warning logs.
    - Return 0 to indicate successful initialization.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer value of 0, indicating successful initialization.


---
### check\_hex\_encoding<!-- {{#callable:check_hex_encoding}} -->
The `check_hex_encoding` function verifies if a given string of characters is a valid hexadecimal encoding and returns the size of the string if valid, or the index of the first invalid character if not.
- **Inputs**:
    - `enc`: A pointer to a constant character array representing the string to be checked for valid hexadecimal encoding.
    - `sz`: An unsigned long integer representing the size of the character array to be checked.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize a loop counter `i` to 0 and iterate over the range from 0 to `sz`.
    - For each character `c` in the string `enc`, check if it is a valid hexadecimal character ('0'-'9', 'a'-'f', or 'A'-'F').
    - If the character is valid, continue to the next iteration of the loop.
    - If the character is invalid, return the current index `i` as the position of the first invalid character.
    - If all characters are valid, return `sz` after the loop completes.
- **Output**: Returns an unsigned long integer which is either the size of the string if all characters are valid hexadecimal digits, or the index of the first invalid character if any are found.


---
### LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput<!-- {{#callable:LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput}} -->
The function `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` processes a given input data buffer by decoding it from hexadecimal format and verifying its validity.
- **Inputs**:
    - `data`: A pointer to an array of unsigned characters representing the input data to be processed.
    - `size`: The size of the input data buffer in bytes.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if the input size exceeds the maximum allowed size (`MAX_DATA_SZ`), and return -1 if it does.
    - Cast the input data to a character pointer for processing as a hexadecimal encoded string.
    - Adjust the size to be even by ignoring the last character if the size is odd.
    - Decode the hexadecimal encoded input data into a decoded buffer using [`fd_hex_decode`](fd_hex.c.driver.md#fd_hex_decode).
    - Assert that the size of the decoded data matches the expected size based on the validity check of the encoding using [`check_hex_encoding`](#check_hex_encoding).
    - Invoke `FD_FUZZ_MUST_BE_COVERED` to ensure code coverage requirements are met.
    - Return 0 to indicate successful processing.
- **Output**: The function returns 0 on successful processing of the input data, or -1 if the input size exceeds the maximum allowed size.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`fd_hex_decode`](fd_hex.c.driver.md#fd_hex_decode)
    - [`check_hex_encoding`](#check_hex_encoding)
