# Purpose
This file is a Makefile snippet used for building a software project. It defines build rules by adding header files and object files to the build process using the `add-hdrs` and `add-objs` functions. Additionally, it conditionally includes a fuzz test target, `fuzz_hex`, if the `FD_HAS_HOSTED` variable is defined, indicating a hosted environment.
