## Files
- **[fd_sha1.c](sha1/fd_sha1.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_sha1.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase provides an implementation of the SHA-1 hashing algorithm, adapted from the teeny sha1 library.
- **[fd_sha1.h](sha1/fd_sha1.h.driver.md)**: The `fd_sha1.h` file declares a function for computing the SHA1 hash of input data and writing the result into a specified buffer.
- **[Local.mk](sha1/Local.mk.driver.md)**: The `Local.mk` file in the `firedancer` codebase specifies the headers, objects, and unit tests for the SHA-1 implementation, including running the `test_sha1` unit test.
- **[test_sha1.c](sha1/test_sha1.c.driver.md)**: The `test_sha1.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase contains a test suite for verifying the correctness of the SHA-1 hash function implementation by comparing computed hashes of predefined inputs against expected output values.
