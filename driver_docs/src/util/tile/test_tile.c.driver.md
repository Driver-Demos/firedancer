# Purpose
This C source code file is designed to test and validate the functionality of a multi-tile execution environment, likely within a parallel computing or distributed system framework. The code includes a main function and a secondary function, [`tile_main`](#tile_main), which are used to initialize and manage the execution of tasks across multiple "tiles" or processing units. The file includes tests for stack management, tile identification, and task dispatching, ensuring that the system's assumptions about stack growth and tile execution are correct. The [`test_stack`](#test_stack) function checks the integrity of stack operations, while the [`tile_main`](#tile_main) function verifies the correct dispatch and execution of tasks on different tiles, including checks for tile-to-tile dispatch and execution state validation.

The code is structured to provide a comprehensive test suite for the tile execution environment, utilizing assertions and logging to ensure that each component behaves as expected. It includes checks for the number of tiles, their identifiers, and their indices, as well as the ability to dispatch tasks to different tiles and verify their execution. The file is not intended to be a standalone application but rather a test harness for validating the underlying system's capabilities. It does not define public APIs or external interfaces but instead focuses on internal testing and validation of the tile execution framework.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `../fd_util.h`


# Global Variables

---
### \_argv
- **Type**: `char const * _argv[]`
- **Description**: The `_argv` variable is a global array of constant character pointers, initialized with two string literals, "Hey" and "You", followed by a NULL pointer. This array is used to simulate command-line arguments for testing purposes.
- **Use**: This variable is used in the `tile_main` and `main` functions to provide a consistent set of arguments for testing the execution of tiles.


# Functions

---
### test\_stack<!-- {{#callable:test_stack}} -->
The `test_stack` function tests the stack memory boundaries and usage estimates for a tile, ensuring they are within expected limits and assumptions.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function begins by obtaining the initial stack pointer `stack0` using `fd_tile_stack0()`.
    - If `stack0` is zero, it checks that other stack-related functions return zero, indicating no stack is present.
    - If `stack0` is non-zero, it retrieves the end stack pointer `stack1`, stack size `stack_sz`, estimated free stack `stack_est_free`, and estimated used stack `stack_est_used`.
    - It verifies that `stack1` is greater than `stack0`, and that the stack size matches the difference between `stack1` and `stack0`.
    - The function checks that the estimated free and used stack sizes are within the total stack size and that more stack is free than used.
    - It performs a sanity check to ensure the sum of estimated free and used stack sizes is approximately equal to the total stack size.
    - A memory location on the stack is accessed to ensure it lies within the stack boundaries.
    - A notice log is generated, and a loop reads each byte in the stack range to ensure no memory access violations occur.
- **Output**: The function does not return any value; it performs tests and logs results to verify stack properties.

### tile\_main<!-- {{#callable:tile_main}} -->
The `tile_main` function tests the execution and dispatching of tasks across different tiles in a multi-tile system.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments passed to the function, representing the current tile index.
    - `argv`: An array of command-line arguments, expected to match a predefined set of arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Log and validate the number of tiles, tile IDs, and tile index using `FD_LOG_NOTICE` and `FD_TEST` macros.
    - Flush the log buffer using `fd_log_flush()`.
    - Call `test_stack()` to perform stack-related tests.
    - Validate that the current tile ID matches the log thread ID.
    - Check that `argc` matches the current tile index and `argv` matches the predefined `_argv`.
    - Attempt to dispatch a new task to tile 0 and the current tile, expecting failure.
    - If the current tile index is the second last tile, dispatch a task to the next tile and perform various checks on the execution object.
    - Return `argc` as the function's result.
- **Output**: The function returns the `argc` value, which represents the current tile index.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`test_stack`](#test_stack)

### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function initializes the environment, validates tile and CPU configurations, and executes tasks across multiple tiles, ensuring correct execution and cleanup.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments passed to the program.
    - `argv`: An array of strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize the environment using `fd_boot` with `argc` and `argv`.
    - Retrieve the number of tiles using `fd_tile_cnt` and log the count.
    - Validate the tile count is within expected bounds and log tile IDs and indices.
    - Flush the log buffer to ensure all messages are outputted.
    - Call `test_stack` to perform stack-related tests.
    - If `FD_HAS_HOSTED` is defined, retrieve the CPU count and iterate over each tile to validate CPU assignments, logging results and warnings as necessary.
    - Flush the log buffer again.
    - Ensure the current tile ID matches the log thread ID.
    - Iterate over each tile (except the first and last) to execute `tile_main` on each tile, validating execution and cleanup.
    - Log a 'pass' message and halt the program.
- **Output**: The function returns 0, indicating successful execution.
