## Files
- **[fd_tile.c](tile/fd_tile.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_tile.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase provides functions to get and set CPU affinity for a process on Linux systems, with a fallback to return an error on unsupported platforms.
- **[fd_tile.h](tile/fd_tile.h.driver.md)**: The `fd_tile.h` file in the `firedancer` codebase provides an interface for fast task dispatching within a thread group, including functions for managing tile execution, stack diagnostics, and retrieving tile-specific information.
- **[fd_tile_nothreads.cxx](tile/fd_tile_nothreads.cxx.driver.md)**: The `fd_tile_nothreads.cxx` file in the `firedancer` codebase provides an implementation for managing tile execution without threading, including functions for booting and halting tiles, as well as handling tile execution tasks and their associated metadata.
- **[fd_tile_private.h](tile/fd_tile_private.h.driver.md)**: The `fd_tile_private.h` file in the `firedancer` codebase provides internal utilities for managing CPU sets and thread affinity, including replacements for libc's `cpu_set_t` to address stability issues, specifically for use within the `fd_tile` module.
- **[fd_tile_threads.cxx](tile/fd_tile_threads.cxx.driver.md)**: The `fd_tile_threads.cxx` file in the `firedancer` codebase provides functionality for managing and executing tasks on CPU tiles, including configuring CPU priorities, creating and managing stacks, and handling thread affinity and execution states.
- **[Local.mk](tile/Local.mk.driver.md)**: The `Local.mk` file in the `firedancer` codebase is a makefile script that manages the inclusion of headers and objects, and conditionally compiles and runs unit tests for `fd_tile` based on the presence of threading support.
- **[test_cpuset.c](tile/test_cpuset.c.driver.md)**: The `test_cpuset.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase tests the `fd_cpuset_t` type as a replacement for the `cpu_set_t` API, ensuring compatibility and correct behavior with POSIX functions.
- **[test_tile.c](tile/test_tile.c.driver.md)**: The `test_tile.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase contains tests for tile stack operations and tile execution management, including dispatching tasks to different tiles and verifying their execution.
