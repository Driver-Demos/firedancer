# Purpose
The file is a Makefile snippet used for building and testing a software component. It defines build rules by adding headers and object files, specifically `fd_io.h` and `fd_io`, `fd_util` respectively. It also specifies the creation and execution of a unit test named `test_io`, which depends on `fd_util`.
