# Purpose
This C header file provides a header-only API for efficient manipulation of small index sets, where the set is represented using a primitive unsigned integer type. The file is designed to be included in other C source files, allowing developers to define custom set types by specifying a set name and optionally customizing the underlying data type and maximum set size. The API offers a comprehensive suite of operations for set manipulation, including constructors, index operations, boolean checks, unary and binary operations, and iteration over set elements. It also includes range-based operations for efficient manipulation of contiguous subsets of elements.

The API is highly customizable, allowing users to define the underlying data type (`SET_TYPE`), the maximum number of elements (`SET_MAX`), and the integral type used for indexing (`SET_IDX_T`). The file includes default implementations for population count, finding the least significant bit, and popping the least significant bit, which can be overridden for optimization. The API ensures safe usage by providing assertions and error logging for invalid operations when handholding is enabled. This file is intended for use in performance-critical applications where small sets need to be manipulated quickly and efficiently, leveraging bitwise operations for optimal performance.
# Imports and Dependencies

- `../bits/fd_bits.h`
- `../log/fd_log.h`


# Global Variables

### MAX
- **Type**: `enum constant`
- **Description**: `MAX` is an enumerated constant defined as part of a set of constants used for managing index sets. It is set to the value of `SET_MAX`, which represents the maximum number of elements that can be held in a set.
- **Use**: `MAX` is used to define the upper limit of elements in a set, ensuring that operations on the set do not exceed this limit.


---
### SET\_
- **Type**: `macro`
- **Description**: The `SET_` macro is used to concatenate the `SET_NAME` with a given suffix, effectively creating a unique identifier for set-related functions and types. This macro is part of a template system that allows for the creation of a set API with a customizable name, making it easier to manage multiple sets with different names in the same codebase.
- **Use**: The `SET_` macro is used to generate unique function and type names by concatenating `SET_NAME` with a specified suffix, ensuring that the set operations are correctly namespaced.


# Functions

---
### SET\_<!-- {{#callable:SET_}} -->
The `SET_(range_cnt)` function calculates the number of elements in a set that fall within a specified range.
- **Inputs**:
    - `x`: A set represented as a primitive unsigned integer type, which contains the elements to be counted.
    - `l`: The lower bound of the range (inclusive) within which elements are to be counted.
    - `h`: The upper bound of the range (exclusive) within which elements are to be counted.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function first computes the intersection of the set `x` with a range set created by `SET_(range)(l,h)`, which represents all elements within the range [l, h).
    - It then calculates the population count (number of set bits) of the resulting intersection using `SET_POPCNT`, which effectively counts the number of elements in `x` that are within the specified range.
- **Output**: The function returns the count of elements in the set `x` that are within the specified range [l, h) as a value of type `SET_IDX_T`.
