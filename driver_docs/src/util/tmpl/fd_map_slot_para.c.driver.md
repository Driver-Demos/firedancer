# Purpose
The provided C code is a template for generating concurrent persistent shared maps using linear probing with enhancements inspired by cuckoo hashing to improve concurrent performance. This code is designed to support a high number of concurrent operations with performance comparable to single-threaded high-performance computing (HPC) linear probed maps for non-conflicting operations. It allows for concurrent queries without interference, serializable map operations, and does not require a key sentinel or guarantee of free elements in the store. The map operations, including insert, modify, and query, have a runtime configurable worst-case O(1) cost, regardless of the map's fill ratio, although the remove operation's worst-case cost is not configurable.

The code is structured to be included in a C project as a header-only library or as a library with separate header and implementation files, depending on the `MAP_IMPL_STYLE` macro. It defines a set of macros and functions to manage the map's lifecycle, including creation, joining, leaving, and deletion, as well as operations like hinting, preparing, removing, querying, locking, and iterating over map elements. The map can be persisted beyond the lifetime of the creating process, used inter-process, relocated in memory, serialized/deserialized, and moved between hosts. The implementation prioritizes massive concurrency, high algorithmic and implementation performance, and friendly cache and file system streaming access patterns for heavily loaded and concurrent usage scenarios.

### MAP\_
- **Type**: `function pointer`
- **Description**: `MAP_` is a macro used to generate function names for a concurrent persistent shared map implementation. It is used to create unique function names by concatenating a prefix (defined by `MAP_NAME`) with a specific function name, such as `iter_init`. This allows for the creation of multiple map instances with different configurations in the same codebase without name conflicts.
- **Use**: `MAP_` is used to generate function names for operations on a concurrent map, ensuring unique identifiers for each map instance.


# Functions

---
### MAP\_<!-- {{#callable:MAP_}} -->
The `MAP_(strerror)` function returns a human-readable string describing the error code passed to it.
- **Inputs**:
    - `err`: An integer representing an error code, which can be one of the predefined error codes like FD_MAP_SUCCESS, FD_MAP_ERR_INVAL, FD_MAP_ERR_AGAIN, FD_MAP_ERR_FULL, or FD_MAP_ERR_KEY.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function uses a switch statement to match the input error code 'err' with predefined error codes.
    - If 'err' matches FD_MAP_SUCCESS, it returns the string "success".
    - If 'err' matches FD_MAP_ERR_INVAL, it returns the string "bad input".
    - If 'err' matches FD_MAP_ERR_AGAIN, it returns the string "try again later".
    - If 'err' matches FD_MAP_ERR_FULL, it returns the string "map too full".
    - If 'err' matches FD_MAP_ERR_KEY, it returns the string "key not found".
    - If 'err' does not match any predefined error codes, it returns the string "unknown".
- **Output**: A constant character pointer to a string that describes the error code.
