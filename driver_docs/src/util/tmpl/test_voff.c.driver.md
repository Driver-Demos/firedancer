# Purpose
This C source code file is designed to test the functionality of a version-offset (voff) encoding mechanism. It includes two distinct configurations of the voff mechanism, each defined by different version and offset widths. The file imports a utility header (`fd_util.h`) and a voff implementation file (`fd_voff.c`) twice, each time with different preprocessor definitions to create two separate voff types: `my_voff` and `my_voff1`. The `my_voff` type is configured with a version width of 20 bits and an offset width of 44 bits, while `my_voff1` is configured with a version width of 13 bits and an offset width of 19 bits. The code uses static assertions to ensure that these configurations are correctly set.

The main function initializes a random number generator and performs extensive testing on both voff types. It verifies that the version and offset values are correctly encoded and decoded, ensuring that the maximum values for each field are respected. The tests involve generating random version and offset values, encoding them into a voff, and then decoding them to check for consistency. The file concludes by cleaning up the random number generator and logging a success message if all tests pass. This code is primarily intended for internal testing and validation of the voff encoding mechanism, rather than providing a public API or external interface.

# Functions

---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function initializes the environment, performs tests on version and offset encoding/decoding functions, and logs the results.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The count of command-line arguments passed to the program.
    - `argv`: An array of strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize the environment using `fd_boot` with command-line arguments.
    - Create and join a random number generator using `fd_rng_new` and `fd_rng_join`.
    - Perform static assertions to verify version and offset width constants for `my_voff` and `my_voff1`.
    - Test `my_voff` functions by generating random version and offset values, encoding them, and verifying the decoding matches the original values for 10,000,000 iterations.
    - Test `my_voff1` functions similarly with different version and offset widths for 10,000,000 iterations.
    - Delete the random number generator using `fd_rng_delete`.
    - Log a notice indicating the tests passed using `FD_LOG_NOTICE`.
    - Halt the program using `fd_halt` and return 0.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer value of 0, indicating successful execution.
