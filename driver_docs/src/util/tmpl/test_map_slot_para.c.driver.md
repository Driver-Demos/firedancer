# Purpose
This C source code file is designed to test the functionality and performance of a concurrent hash map implementation, specifically focusing on operations such as insertion, deletion, modification, and querying of map elements. The code defines a custom map element structure (`myele_t`) and uses a series of macros to configure the behavior of the map, such as key hashing, element comparison, and memory management. The file includes a test harness that simulates concurrent access to the map by multiple "tiles" (threads or processes), each performing a variety of operations on the map to ensure its robustness under concurrent conditions. The code also includes extensive assertions and logging to verify the correctness of operations and to provide diagnostic information during execution.

The file is structured to be part of a larger test suite, as indicated by its inclusion of a separate map implementation file (`fd_map_slot_para.c`) and its use of shared memory for element storage. It defines a main function that initializes the test environment, configures the map parameters, and executes the test scenarios across multiple tiles. The code is highly focused on testing the map's concurrency features, as evidenced by the use of synchronization primitives and the testing of various error conditions. The file does not define a public API but rather serves as an internal test for validating the map's implementation.
# Imports and Dependencies

- `../fd_util.h`
- `fd_map_slot_para.c`


# Global Variables

---
### shmem
- **Type**: ``uchar[]``
- **Description**: The `shmem` variable is a static array of unsigned characters (`uchar`) with a size defined by `SHMEM_MAX`, which is set to 1 megabyte (1UL<<20). It is used to allocate shared memory for various operations within the program.
- **Use**: `shmem` is used as a buffer to allocate memory dynamically during the execution of the program, ensuring that the memory usage does not exceed the predefined maximum size.


---
### shmem\_cnt
- **Type**: `ulong`
- **Description**: The `shmem_cnt` is a static global variable of type `ulong` initialized to 0UL. It is used to track the current offset or position within a shared memory buffer `shmem`, which is an array of `uchar` with a maximum size defined by `SHMEM_MAX`. This variable helps manage memory allocation within the shared memory space by keeping track of how much memory has been allocated so far.
- **Use**: `shmem_cnt` is used to keep track of the current allocation position within the shared memory buffer `shmem`.


---
### tile\_map
- **Type**: `mymap_t *`
- **Description**: The `tile_map` is a static global pointer to a `mymap_t` structure, which represents a map data structure used for concurrent operations in the program. It is initialized and used within the `main` function to manage elements and locks for concurrent tile operations.
- **Use**: `tile_map` is used to store and manage the map data structure for concurrent operations across multiple tiles in the program.


---
### tile\_iter\_cnt
- **Type**: `ulong`
- **Description**: `tile_iter_cnt` is a static global variable of type `ulong` that holds the number of iterations to be performed by each tile in a concurrent operation test. It is initialized with a value that is set during the program's execution, specifically in the `main` function, where it is assigned the value of `iter_cnt`.
- **Use**: This variable is used to control the number of iterations each tile performs during concurrent operations on a map data structure.


---
### tile\_go
- **Type**: `ulong`
- **Description**: `tile_go` is a static global variable of type `ulong` that is used as a flag to control the execution flow of concurrent operations on multiple tiles. It is initialized to zero and is set to one to signal the start of operations.
- **Use**: This variable is used to synchronize the start of concurrent operations across multiple tiles by being checked in a loop until it is set to a non-zero value.


# Data Structures

---
### myele
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `mykey`: An unsigned integer representing the key of the element.
    - `used`: An integer indicating whether the element is currently in use.
    - `val`: An unsigned integer representing the value associated with the element.
    - `mod`: An unsigned integer used for modification tracking.
    - `mymemo`: An unsigned long integer used for memoization purposes.
- **Description**: The `myele` structure is a custom data structure designed to represent an element within a map, where each element is identified by a unique key (`mykey`). The `used` field indicates whether the element is active or free, while `val` holds the value associated with the element. The `mod` field is used to track modifications, and `mymemo` is used for memoization, likely to optimize hash-based operations. This structure is integral to the map's functionality, allowing for efficient storage and retrieval of key-value pairs.


---
### myele\_t
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `mykey`: An unsigned integer representing the key of the element.
    - `used`: An integer flag indicating whether the element is currently in use.
    - `val`: An unsigned integer representing the value associated with the key.
    - `mod`: An unsigned integer used for modification tracking.
    - `mymemo`: An unsigned long integer used for memoization purposes.
- **Description**: The `myele_t` structure is a custom data type used to represent an element in a map-like data structure. It contains a key (`mykey`), a value (`val`), and additional fields for tracking usage (`used`), modifications (`mod`), and memoization (`mymemo`). This structure is designed to be used in conjunction with a map implementation, where each element can be inserted, queried, modified, or removed based on its key. The `used` field helps in determining if the element is active, while `mod` and `mymemo` assist in managing state changes and optimizing operations.


# Functions

---
### shmem\_alloc<!-- {{#callable:shmem_alloc}} -->
The `shmem_alloc` function allocates a block of memory from a shared memory pool, ensuring alignment and updating the allocation counter.
- **Inputs**:
    - `a`: The alignment requirement for the memory block to be allocated.
    - `s`: The size of the memory block to be allocated.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Calculate the aligned memory address `m` by aligning the current position in the shared memory (`shmem + shmem_cnt`) to the specified alignment `a` using `fd_ulong_align_up`.
    - Update the shared memory allocation counter `shmem_cnt` to reflect the new allocation by adding the size `s` to the aligned address `m` and subtracting the base address `shmem`.
    - Check if the updated `shmem_cnt` exceeds the maximum allowed shared memory size `SHMEM_MAX` using `FD_TEST`.
    - Return the aligned memory address `m` cast to a `void *`.
- **Output**: A pointer to the allocated memory block, aligned as specified.
