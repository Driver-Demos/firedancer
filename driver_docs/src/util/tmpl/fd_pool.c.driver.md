# Purpose
The provided C code defines a template for creating object pools with a bounded maximum size, optimized for high-performance, non-concurrent, persistent inter-process communication (IPC) usage. This code is designed to be included in other C files, allowing developers to define custom object pools by specifying the pool's name and the type of elements it will contain. The template provides a set of static inline functions that manage the lifecycle of the pool, including creating, joining, leaving, and deleting pools, as well as acquiring and releasing elements within the pool. The code is structured to ensure that the pool's memory is properly aligned and that operations on the pool are efficient and safe, with checks for invalid operations.

The code is highly modular and customizable, allowing for the creation of multiple pools with different configurations within the same compilation unit. It includes mechanisms for handling special values such as null and sentinel elements, and provides functions for converting between element indices and pointers. The template also includes options for additional features, such as using a sentinel element and specifying a magic number for identifying pools in shared memory. The design emphasizes performance and safety, with inline functions to minimize overhead and checks to prevent invalid operations. The code is intended to be used as a header-only library, making it easy to integrate into existing projects.

# Functions

---
### POOL\_<!-- {{#callable:POOL_}} -->
The `POOL_(ele_release)` function releases an element back to the pool by calculating its index and calling the index release function.
- **Inputs**:
    - `join`: A pointer to the pool from which the element is being released.
    - `ele`: A pointer to the element that is being released back to the pool.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Calculate the index of the element to be released by subtracting the base address of the pool from the element's address.
    - Call the `POOL_(idx_release)` function with the calculated index to release the element back to the pool.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it performs the operation of releasing an element back to the pool.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`POOL_`](#POOL_)
