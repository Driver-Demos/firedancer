# Purpose
The provided C code is a comprehensive implementation of a high-performance B+ tree-based key-value store. This code is designed to be highly efficient, supporting operations such as insertion, deletion, and querying with a time complexity of O(log N) in the worst case. The B+ tree structure is optimized for persistence, concurrent usage, inter-process communication (IPC), and memory relocation, making it suitable for various applications that require fast and reliable data storage and retrieval.

The code is structured to be used as a header-only library, allowing for easy integration into other projects. It defines a set of macros and functions that enable the creation and manipulation of B+ trees with customizable key and pair types. The implementation includes constructors for creating and joining B+ trees, accessors for retrieving tree properties, and operations for inserting, upserting, and removing keys. Additionally, it provides iterators for traversing the tree in both forward and reverse order. The code also includes mechanisms for verifying the integrity of the B+ tree and ensuring that it remains balanced after operations. Overall, this code offers a robust and flexible solution for managing large datasets with high performance and low latency.

# Global Variables

### BPLUS\_
- **Type**: `function pointer`
- **Description**: `BPLUS_` is a macro used to generate function names for operations on a B+ tree data structure. It is used to concatenate a prefix (defined by `BPLUS_NAME`) with a specific operation name, allowing for the creation of a namespaced API for B+ tree operations.
- **Use**: This macro is used to create function names for B+ tree operations by concatenating a user-defined prefix with operation-specific names, ensuring unique and consistent naming across different instances of B+ trees.


# Functions

---
### BPLUS\_<!-- {{#callable:BPLUS_}} -->
The `BPLUS_(verify)` function validates the integrity and structure of a B+ tree data structure, ensuring all nodes and leaves are correctly aligned, ordered, and linked.
- **Inputs**:
    - `join`: A pointer to a `BPLUS_(t)` structure representing a joined B+ tree instance to be verified.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Define a macro `BPLUS_TEST` for condition checking and logging failures.
    - Verify the `join` pointer is not null and aligned correctly.
    - Retrieve the private metadata of the B+ tree from the `join` pointer.
    - Check the magic number to ensure the structure is initialized correctly.
    - Validate the maximum node and leaf counts against predefined limits.
    - Verify the alignment and offsets of nodes and leaves in the memory region.
    - Check the root, minimum, and maximum leaf offsets for validity and alignment.
    - If the root exists, validate its offset and alignment, and check the leaf offsets similarly.
    - Iterate through the node pool, verifying each node's offset and alignment, and decrement the remaining node count.
    - Iterate through the leaf pool, verifying each leaf's offset and alignment, and decrement the remaining leaf count.
    - If the tree is not empty, validate the tree structure using a stack-based traversal to ensure nodes and leaves are correctly ordered and linked.
    - Ensure all nodes and leaves have been accounted for by checking the remaining counts.
    - Validate the forward and reverse iteration through the leaves, ensuring correct ordering and linking.
- **Output**: Returns 0 if the B+ tree is valid, or -1 if any validation checks fail, logging the specific failure.
