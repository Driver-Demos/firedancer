# Purpose
This C source code file is a template for generating high-performance hash map implementations using hash chains. The code is designed to be highly efficient in both time and space, with typical operations achieving O(1) time complexity and minimal space overhead. The template allows for the creation of maps that can store a large number of elements, and it supports various advanced features such as inter-process usage, memory relocation, and serialization. The code is intended to be included in other C files, where it can be customized by defining specific macros to tailor the map's behavior and structure to the user's needs.

The file provides a comprehensive API for managing hash maps, including functions for creating, joining, and deleting maps, as well as inserting, removing, and querying elements. It supports both single and multiple entries for the same key, depending on the configuration. The template also includes options for optimizing random access removal and supports concurrent queries under certain conditions. The code is structured to allow for easy integration with other data structures like pools, treaps, and lists, making it a versatile tool for developers needing efficient map implementations in their applications.

### MAP\_
- **Type**: `macro`
- **Description**: `MAP_` is a macro used to concatenate the `MAP_NAME` with a given suffix, effectively creating a unique identifier for map-related functions and types. It is used to generate function and type names dynamically based on the defined `MAP_NAME`, allowing for the creation of multiple map instances with different names in the same compilation unit.
- **Use**: This macro is used to create unique identifiers for map functions and types by concatenating the `MAP_NAME` with a specified suffix.


# Functions

---
### MAP\_<!-- {{#callable:MAP_}} -->
The `MAP_(ele_next_const)` function retrieves the next element in a map with the same key as a previously queried element, returning a sentinel if no such element exists.
- **Inputs**:
    - `prev`: A pointer to the previous element found by `mymap_ele_query_const`.
    - `sentinel`: A pointer to the sentinel value to return if the key is not found in the map.
    - `pool`: A pointer to the current local join to the element storage.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Calculate the index of the next element with the same key using `MAP_(idx_next_const)` by passing the index of the previous element, a null index, and the pool.
    - Check if the calculated index is not null using `MAP_(private_idx_is_null)`.
    - If the index is not null, return the element at the calculated index in the pool.
    - If the index is null, return the sentinel value.
- **Output**: A pointer to the found element in the pool on success, or the sentinel value on failure.
