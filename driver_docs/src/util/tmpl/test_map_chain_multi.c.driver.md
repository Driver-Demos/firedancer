# Purpose
This C source code file is an executable program designed to test and demonstrate the functionality of a custom data structure that combines sorting, pooling, and mapping operations on a collection of `pair_t` structures. The code includes the definition of a `pair` structure, which contains four unsigned integer fields: `mykey`, `mynext`, `val`, and `tag`. The program utilizes three external modules: `fd_sort.c`, `fd_pool.c`, and `fd_map_chain.c`, which provide sorting, pooling, and mapping functionalities, respectively. The code defines macros to configure these modules to work with the `pair_t` type, allowing for operations such as sorting pairs by their `mykey`, managing a pool of pairs, and mapping pairs using a hash map with chaining.

The main function initializes the environment and sets up parameters for testing, such as pool size, chain count, random seed, and iteration count. It then performs a series of tests to validate the behavior of the pool and map operations, including insertion, deletion, and iteration over elements. The program uses a random number generator to shuffle elements and simulate various scenarios, ensuring the robustness of the data structure. The code also includes extensive logging and assertions to verify the correctness of each operation, making it a comprehensive test suite for the custom data structure.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `../fd_util.h`
- `fd_sort.c`
- `fd_pool.c`
- `fd_map_chain.c`


# Global Variables

---
### scratch
- **Type**: `uchar array`
- **Description**: The `scratch` variable is a global array of unsigned characters with a size defined by the macro `SCRATCH_SZ`, which is set to 32768. This array serves as a memory buffer for temporary storage during the execution of the program.
- **Use**: The `scratch` array is used to allocate memory dynamically for various operations within the program, ensuring that the memory requirements do not exceed the predefined size.


# Data Structures

---
### pair
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `mykey`: An unsigned integer representing the key of the pair.
    - `mynext`: An unsigned integer used to link to the next element in a pool or map.
    - `val`: An unsigned integer representing the value associated with the key.
    - `tag`: An unsigned integer used as a tag for various operations, such as iteration or verification.
- **Description**: The `pair` structure is a compound data type used to represent a key-value pair with additional metadata for linking and tagging. It is primarily used in conjunction with sorting, pooling, and mapping operations, as seen in the accompanying code. The `mykey` field serves as the key for sorting and mapping, while `mynext` is used to manage linked lists within a pool or map. The `val` field holds the value associated with the key, and `tag` is used for tagging elements during operations like iteration or verification. This structure is integral to the implementation of various data management functionalities in the provided code.

### pair\_t
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `mykey`: An unsigned integer used as the key for sorting and mapping operations.
    - `mynext`: An unsigned integer used to link to the next element in a pool or map.
    - `val`: An unsigned integer representing the value associated with the key.
    - `tag`: An unsigned integer used for tagging or marking elements, often for iteration or verification purposes.
- **Description**: The `pair_t` structure is a compound data type used to represent a key-value pair with additional metadata for linking and tagging. It is primarily used in sorting, pooling, and mapping operations, where `mykey` serves as the key for sorting and mapping, `mynext` is used to link elements in a pool or map, `val` holds the associated value, and `tag` is used for tagging elements during iteration or verification processes. This structure is integral to the operations defined in the accompanying sorting, pooling, and mapping modules.


# Functions

---
### shuffle\_pair<!-- {{#callable:shuffle_pair}} -->
The `shuffle_pair` function randomly shuffles the elements of an array of `pair_t` structures using the Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm.
- **Inputs**:
    - `rng`: A pointer to an `fd_rng_t` random number generator used to generate random indices for shuffling.
    - `pair`: A pointer to an array of `pair_t` structures that will be shuffled.
    - `cnt`: The number of elements in the `pair` array to shuffle.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function iterates over the array starting from the second element (index 1) to the last element (index `cnt-1`).
    - For each element at index `i`, it generates a random index `j` between 0 and `i` (inclusive) using the `fd_rng_ulong_roll` function.
    - It then swaps the elements at indices `i` and `j` in the `pair` array.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it modifies the input `pair` array in place to shuffle its elements.


---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function initializes and tests a hash map and pool data structure with randomized operations, including insertion, iteration, and deletion, while validating the integrity of the operations.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments passed to the program.
    - `argv`: An array of strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize the environment and parse command-line arguments for pool size, chain count, seed, and iteration count.
    - Log the test parameters and initialize a random number generator.
    - Check if the pool size exceeds the limit and log a warning if so, then return.
    - Initialize reference and test arrays with random values and sort the reference array.
    - Allocate memory for the pool and join it, checking alignment and size constraints.
    - Perform various tests on map properties and constraints, including chain count estimation and key hashing.
    - Allocate memory for the map and create a new map instance, checking for alignment and size constraints.
    - Join the map and verify its properties, including chain count and seed.
    - Iterate over a series of test iterations, logging progress every 100 iterations.
    - In each iteration, shuffle the test array and perform insertion, iteration, and deletion operations on the map.
    - Validate the integrity of the map and pool after each operation.
    - After all iterations, delete and leave the map and pool, and clean up the random number generator.
    - Log a success message and halt the program.
- **Output**: The function returns 0, indicating successful execution, or exits early with 0 if certain constraints are not met.
