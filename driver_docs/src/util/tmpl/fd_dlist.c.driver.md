# Purpose
The provided C code is a template for generating implementations of high-performance, doubly linked lists (dlists) that can be customized for various data types and use cases. This code is designed to be highly efficient in both time and space, with typical operations such as insertion and deletion being performed in constant time, O(1). The template allows for the creation of dlists that can handle a large number of elements, and it supports advanced features such as memory persistence, inter-process communication, and memory relocation. The code is structured to be tightly integrated with other data structures like pools, treaps, heaps, and maps, making it versatile for complex data management tasks.

The code defines a set of macros and functions that facilitate the creation and manipulation of dlists. It includes functions for initializing, joining, and leaving a dlist, as well as for performing operations like pushing, popping, inserting, and removing elements. The template also provides iteration capabilities, allowing for both forward and reverse traversal of the list. The code is designed to be included in a compilation unit, where it generates a header-only style library for the specified dlist type. This approach allows for the creation of multiple dlist types within the same program, each with its own set of operations and characteristics. The template emphasizes memory efficiency and provides options for customizing the underlying data types and operations, making it suitable for a wide range of applications.
# Imports and Dependencies

# Global Variables

### DLIST\_
- **Type**: `function pointer`
- **Description**: `DLIST_(delete)` is a function pointer that takes a single argument of type `void *` and returns a `void *`. It is part of a doubly linked list API designed for high-performance computing (HPC) applications.
- **Use**: This function pointer is used to unformat a memory region used as a doubly linked list, ensuring that the list is properly deleted and its resources are freed.


# Functions

---
### DLIST\_<!-- {{#callable:DLIST_}} -->
The `DLIST_(verify)` function checks the integrity of a doubly linked list by validating its structure and element links.
- **Inputs**:
    - `join`: A pointer to the doubly linked list structure to be verified.
    - `ele_cnt`: The number of elements in the element storage, which should not exceed the maximum allowed by the list.
    - `pool`: A pointer to the array of elements that the doubly linked list uses for storage.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Define a macro `DLIST_TEST` to log a warning and return -1 if a condition fails.
    - Validate the input arguments: ensure `join` is not null, `ele_cnt` does not exceed the maximum, and `pool` is valid if `ele_cnt` is non-zero.
    - Retrieve the internal list structure using `DLIST_(private_const)` and check its magic number for validity.
    - Initialize variables for remaining elements (`rem`), previous index (`prev_idx`), and current element index (`ele_idx`).
    - Iterate through the list using a while loop until `ele_idx` is null, performing checks at each step:
    - - Ensure there are remaining elements to prevent cycles.
    - - Validate that `ele_idx` is within bounds.
    - - Check the reverse link integrity by comparing the previous index of the current element with `prev_idx`.
    - Advance to the next element by updating `prev_idx` and `ele_idx`.
    - After the loop, verify that the tail index matches the last visited element index.
    - Return 0 if all checks pass.
- **Output**: Returns 0 if the doubly linked list is valid, otherwise returns -1 if any validation check fails.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`DLIST_IDX_T::DLIST_`](#DLIST_IDX_TDLIST_)
