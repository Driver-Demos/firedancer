# Purpose
This code is a C header file that defines a set of error codes and flags for a mapping utility, likely used in a larger software project. The file provides a series of preprocessor macros that represent common error codes such as `FD_MAP_SUCCESS`, `FD_MAP_ERR_INVAL`, and `FD_MAP_ERR_FULL`, which are used to indicate the status of operations within the map utility. Additionally, it defines several flags, such as `FD_MAP_FLAG_BLOCKING` and `FD_MAP_FLAG_PREFETCH`, which are used to control the behavior of the map operations, such as blocking behavior and prefetching strategies. The presence of commented-out sections suggests that the file is a work in progress, with potential plans for unifying error codes and flags across the utility. Overall, this header file serves as a configuration and error handling component for a mapping utility in a C program.
