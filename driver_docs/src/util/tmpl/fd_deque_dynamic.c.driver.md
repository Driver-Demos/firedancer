# Purpose
This C source code file provides a template for implementing a single-threaded, fixed-capacity double-ended queue (deque) designed for high-performance contexts. The code is structured to be included in other C files, where the user defines the specific name and type of elements for the deque by setting the `DEQUE_NAME` and `DEQUE_T` macros, respectively. This template generates a comprehensive API for managing deques, including constructors, accessors, and various operations for adding, removing, and accessing elements from both ends of the deque. The API also includes advanced features for zero-copy usage and iteration over deque elements, both in forward and reverse order.

The code is modular and highly customizable, allowing users to create deques tailored to their specific data types and application needs. It provides a broad range of functionality, from basic operations like pushing and popping elements to more complex operations like indexed access and iteration. The implementation emphasizes performance by avoiding error checking within the functions, relying on the caller to ensure preconditions are met. This design choice makes the code suitable for high-performance applications where the overhead of error checking is undesirable. The file does not define public APIs or external interfaces directly; instead, it serves as a template to be included and instantiated in other compilation units, making it a versatile component for building efficient data structures in C.

# Functions

### DEQUE\_<!-- {{#callable:DEQUE_}} -->
The `DEQUE_(iter_ele_const)` function retrieves a constant pointer to an element in a deque at a specified iterator position.
- **Inputs**:
    - `deque`: A constant pointer to the deque from which an element is to be retrieved.
    - `iter`: An iterator of type `DEQUE_(iter_t)` that specifies the position of the element to be retrieved.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Retrieve the constant header of the deque using `DEQUE_(private_const_hdr_from_deque)` function.
    - If handholding is enabled, check if the iterator is out of bounds (i.e., `iter.rem` is 0 or greater than the count of elements in the deque) and log a critical error if so.
    - Return a pointer to the element in the deque at the index specified by `iter.idx`.
- **Output**: A constant pointer to the element in the deque at the specified iterator position.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`DEQUE_`](#DEQUE_)
