# Purpose
This C source code file is designed to test the functionality of a concurrent map data structure, which is implemented in the included file "fd_map_giant.c". The code defines a custom data type `pair_t` that holds key-value pairs, and it uses this type to interact with the map. The main functionality revolves around inserting, querying, and removing elements from the map while ensuring data integrity and correctness through various assertions. The code also includes a separate thread that continuously reads from the map to verify that the entries are valid, even under concurrent access conditions.

The file is structured as an executable program, with a [`main`](#main) function that initializes the environment, sets up a random number generator, and manages a queue of keys for map operations. It uses a fixed-size memory buffer for the map and checks alignment and footprint constraints before proceeding. The program runs a loop for a specified number of iterations, performing map operations and periodically verifying the map's integrity. The use of threading and synchronization is evident in the [`read_thread`](#read_thread) function, which runs concurrently with the main loop to simulate real-world usage scenarios where multiple threads might access the map simultaneously. The program concludes by cleaning up resources and logging the results of the test.
# Imports and Dependencies

- `../fd_util.h`
- `pthread.h`
- `fd_map_giant.c`


# Global Variables

---
### mem
- **Type**: `uchar array`
- **Description**: The `mem` variable is a static array of unsigned characters with a size of 32,768 bytes. It is aligned to a 128-byte boundary using the `__attribute__((aligned(128)))` directive, which ensures that the starting address of the array is a multiple of 128.
- **Use**: This array is used as a memory buffer to store data for the map structure, ensuring proper alignment and size constraints for efficient memory access and operations.


---
### max
- **Type**: `const ulong`
- **Description**: The `max` variable is a constant unsigned long integer set to 512. It represents the maximum number of elements that can be stored in the `queue` array and is used as a limit in various operations throughout the code.
- **Use**: `max` is used to define the size of the `queue` array and to control loop iterations and conditions related to the map and queue operations.


---
### queue
- **Type**: `volatile ulong[512]`
- **Description**: The `queue` is a static volatile array of unsigned long integers with a fixed size of 512 elements. It is used to store keys that are generated and processed in the program.
- **Use**: This variable is used to hold keys that are inserted into and removed from the map, facilitating the management of map entries during the execution of the program.


---
### map
- **Type**: `pair_t *`
- **Description**: The `map` variable is a pointer to a `pair_t` structure, which is defined to hold a key-value pair with additional metadata for linked list traversal. It is used as a global variable to manage a map data structure that supports concurrent access and modification.
- **Use**: This variable is used to store and manage a map of key-value pairs, allowing for operations such as insertion, removal, and querying of elements.


---
### stop\_flag
- **Type**: `int`
- **Description**: The `stop_flag` is a global volatile integer variable used to control the execution of a thread. It is initialized to 0, indicating that the thread should continue running.
- **Use**: The `stop_flag` is used in a while loop within the `read_thread` function to determine when the thread should stop executing.


# Data Structures

---
### pair
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `mykey`: A key of type unsigned long used to identify the pair in a map.
    - `mynext`: A pointer or index of type unsigned long used to link to the next pair in a map.
    - `val`: A value of type unsigned long associated with the key in the pair.
- **Description**: The `pair` structure is a simple data structure used to represent a key-value pair in a map, where `mykey` serves as the unique identifier for the pair, `mynext` is used to link pairs in a map, and `val` holds the value associated with the key. This structure is typically used in conjunction with map operations to store and retrieve data efficiently.


---
### pair\_t
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `mykey`: A unique key of type ulong used to identify the pair in a map.
    - `mynext`: A ulong value used to link to the next element in a map structure.
    - `val`: A ulong value representing the data or value associated with the key.
- **Description**: The `pair_t` structure is a simple data structure used to represent a key-value pair within a map. It consists of three members: `mykey`, which serves as the unique identifier for the pair; `mynext`, which is used to link pairs in a map structure; and `val`, which holds the value associated with the key. This structure is utilized in conjunction with map operations to efficiently store and retrieve data based on keys.


# Functions

---
### read\_thread<!-- {{#callable:read_thread}} -->
The `read_thread` function continuously reads keys from a queue, queries a map for each key, and counts the number of correct, incorrect, and missing entries until a stop flag is set.
- **Inputs**:
    - `arg`: A void pointer argument that is not used in the function.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize counters for rights, wrongs, and blanks to zero.
    - Enter a loop that continues until the `stop_flag` is set to a non-zero value.
    - Iterate over each element in the `queue` array up to `max`.
    - For each key in the queue, query the map using `map_query_safe`.
    - If the query result is NULL, increment the `blanks` counter.
    - If the query result is not NULL, calculate the index of the record in the map and verify its validity using `FD_TEST`.
    - If the key in the record matches the queried key, increment the `rights` counter; otherwise, increment the `wrongs` counter.
    - After exiting the loop, log the counts of rights, wrongs, and blanks.
    - Assert that the `rights` counter is greater than zero.
    - Return NULL.
- **Output**: The function returns NULL after logging the counts of rights, wrongs, and blanks.


---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function initializes and tests a concurrent map data structure using random keys and values, while verifying its integrity and performance through a separate thread.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments passed to the program.
    - `argv`: An array of strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize the environment and parse command-line arguments for seed and iteration maximum values.
    - Log the testing parameters including max, seed, and iter_max.
    - Initialize a random number generator and populate a queue with random values.
    - Check memory alignment and footprint requirements, logging a warning and exiting if they are not met.
    - Create and join a map data structure with the specified parameters, verifying its initial state.
    - Start a separate thread to read and verify map entries concurrently.
    - Iterate up to iter_max times, performing map operations and integrity checks every 200 iterations.
    - If the map is full, remove an entry from the map and update the queue length.
    - Insert a new random key into the map, update its value, and adjust the queue accordingly.
    - Set a stop flag and join the read thread after completing the iterations.
    - Delete the map and random number generator, logging a success message before halting the program.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer status code, typically 0 for successful execution.
