# Purpose
This C source code file is designed to test the functionality of a deque (double-ended queue) implementation. The code includes both static and dynamic deque operations, providing a comprehensive suite of tests to ensure the deque's correctness and robustness. The static section of the code defines a fixed-size buffer and implements basic operations such as pushing and popping elements from both ends of the deque. These operations are encapsulated in functions like [`buf_push_head`](#buf_push_head), [`buf_push_tail`](#buf_push_tail), [`buf_pop_head`](#buf_pop_head), and [`buf_pop_tail`](#buf_pop_tail), which manipulate the buffer while maintaining its circular nature.

The dynamic section of the code, which is included from "fd_deque_dynamic.c", extends the functionality to support a dynamically allocated deque. The [`main`](#main) function orchestrates the testing process, initializing the deque, performing a series of randomized operations, and verifying the results against expected outcomes. It also includes boundary condition tests and error handling scenarios to ensure the deque behaves correctly under various conditions. The code is structured to be executed as a standalone program, with the [`main`](#main) function serving as the entry point. It does not define public APIs or external interfaces but rather focuses on internal testing and validation of the deque's implementation.

# Global Variables

---
### buf
- **Type**: `int array`
- **Description**: `buf` is a static integer array with a size defined by the macro `TEST_DEQUE_MAX`, which is set to 8. It is used to store integer elements in a circular buffer or deque structure.
- **Use**: This variable is used to hold the elements of a deque, allowing operations such as push and pop from both ends.


---
### buf\_start
- **Type**: `ulong`
- **Description**: `buf_start` is a static global variable of type `ulong` initialized to 0. It represents the starting index of a circular buffer used in the program.
- **Use**: It is used to track the position in the buffer where the next element will be pushed or popped from the head.


---
### buf\_end
- **Type**: `ulong`
- **Description**: `buf_end` is a static global variable of type `ulong` initialized to 0. It represents the index in the buffer array `buf` where the next element will be added when using the `buf_push_tail` function.
- **Use**: `buf_end` is used to track the position in the buffer where the next element will be inserted at the tail, and it wraps around when it reaches the maximum buffer size.


---
### buf\_cnt
- **Type**: `ulong`
- **Description**: `buf_cnt` is a static global variable of type `ulong` initialized to 0. It represents the current number of elements in a circular buffer implemented as an array.
- **Use**: It is used to track the number of elements currently stored in the buffer, ensuring operations like push and pop are performed within the buffer's capacity.


---
### scratch
- **Type**: `uchar array`
- **Description**: The `scratch` variable is a global array of unsigned characters with a size defined by `SCRATCH_FOOTPRINT`, which is 1024 bytes. It is aligned in memory according to `SCRATCH_ALIGN`, which is 128 bytes, to ensure proper memory alignment for performance optimization.
- **Use**: This variable is used as a memory buffer for operations involving the `test_deque` data structure, providing a scratch space for its dynamic operations.


# Functions

---
### buf\_push\_head<!-- {{#callable:buf_push_head}} -->
The `buf_push_head` function inserts an integer at the head of a circular buffer, updating the buffer's start index and count.
- **Inputs**:
    - `i`: The integer value to be inserted at the head of the buffer.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if the buffer count is less than the maximum allowed size using `FD_TEST`.
    - Increment the buffer count `buf_cnt`.
    - Decrement the buffer start index `buf_start`.
    - If `buf_start` is greater than or equal to `TEST_DEQUE_MAX`, set `buf_start` to `TEST_DEQUE_MAX-1UL` to wrap around the buffer.
    - Assign the integer `i` to the buffer at the new start index `buf[buf_start]`.
- **Output**: This function does not return a value; it modifies the global buffer state.


---
### buf\_push\_tail<!-- {{#callable:buf_push_tail}} -->
The `buf_push_tail` function adds an integer to the end of a circular buffer, updating the buffer's count and end index, and wrapping the end index if necessary.
- **Inputs**:
    - `i`: The integer value to be added to the end of the buffer.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check that the buffer is not full using `FD_TEST(buf_cnt<TEST_DEQUE_MAX)`; if the buffer is full, the function will not proceed.
    - Assign the integer `i` to the current end position of the buffer, `buf[buf_end]`.
    - Increment the buffer count `buf_cnt` and the end index `buf_end`.
    - Check if `buf_end` has reached or exceeded `TEST_DEQUE_MAX`; if so, wrap `buf_end` back to 0 to maintain the circular nature of the buffer.
- **Output**: This function does not return a value; it modifies the global buffer state by adding an element to the end.


---
### buf\_pop\_head<!-- {{#callable:buf_pop_head}} -->
The `buf_pop_head` function removes and returns the integer at the head of a circular buffer, updating the buffer's start index and count accordingly.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function first checks if the buffer is not empty using `FD_TEST(buf_cnt)`.
    - It retrieves the integer at the current `buf_start` index of the buffer.
    - The buffer's count `buf_cnt` is decremented by one.
    - The `buf_start` index is incremented by one to point to the next element in the buffer.
    - If `buf_start` exceeds or equals `TEST_DEQUE_MAX`, it is reset to 0 to maintain the circular nature of the buffer.
    - The retrieved integer is returned.
- **Output**: The function returns the integer value that was at the head of the buffer before it was removed.


---
### buf\_pop\_tail<!-- {{#callable:buf_pop_tail}} -->
The `buf_pop_tail` function removes and returns the last element from a circular buffer, adjusting the buffer's end index and count accordingly.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if the buffer is not empty using `FD_TEST(buf_cnt)`; if empty, the function will likely trigger an error or halt.
    - Decrement the buffer count `buf_cnt` and the buffer end index `buf_end`.
    - If `buf_end` becomes greater than or equal to `TEST_DEQUE_MAX`, reset `buf_end` to `TEST_DEQUE_MAX-1UL` to handle the circular nature of the buffer.
    - Return the element at the new `buf_end` index from the buffer array `buf`.
- **Output**: The function returns the integer value that was at the tail of the buffer before it was removed.


---
### buf\_pop\_idx<!-- {{#callable:buf_pop_idx}} -->
The `buf_pop_idx` function removes and returns an element from a circular buffer at a specified index, shifting subsequent elements to fill the gap.
- **Inputs**:
    - `idx`: An unsigned long integer representing the index of the element to be removed from the buffer.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if the buffer is not empty using `FD_TEST(buf_cnt)`.
    - Decrement `buf_cnt` and `buf_end`, adjusting `buf_end` if it exceeds `TEST_DEQUE_MAX`.
    - Calculate the position of the element to be removed using `(buf_start + idx) % TEST_DEQUE_MAX` and store its value in `val`.
    - Initialize `gap` with `idx` and enter a loop to shift elements from `gap+1` to `gap` until `gap` exceeds `buf_cnt`.
    - In each iteration, calculate the current and next positions using `(buf_start + gap) % TEST_DEQUE_MAX` and `(buf_start + gap + 1) % TEST_DEQUE_MAX`, respectively, and move the element from the next position to the current position.
    - Increment `gap` in each iteration of the loop.
    - Return the value of the removed element `val`.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer, which is the value of the element removed from the buffer at the specified index.


---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function initializes a random number generator, configures and tests a deque data structure with various operations, and handles edge cases and logging.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments passed to the program.
    - `argv`: An array of strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize the program environment with `fd_boot` and set up a random number generator.
    - Parse the command-line argument `--max` to determine the maximum size of the deque, defaulting to `TEST_DEQUE_MAX`.
    - Check if the `max` value exceeds `TEST_DEQUE_MAX` or if the deque's alignment and footprint exceed predefined limits, logging warnings and exiting if so.
    - Log the maximum size and begin testing the deque's construction, ensuring alignment and footprint constraints are met.
    - Create and join a new deque using `test_deque_new` and `test_deque_join`, logging and testing its initial state.
    - Perform 100 million iterations of random deque operations, including push, pop, and zero-copy operations, while maintaining a buffer to verify correctness.
    - Handle special cases like resetting the deque, iterating over elements, and testing boundary conditions for full and empty deques.
    - Test the deque with a maximum size of zero, ensuring it behaves correctly as empty and full simultaneously.
    - If hosted and handholding is enabled, test invalid operations and boundary conditions, ensuring they trigger critical log messages.
    - Delete the random number generator and log the successful completion of tests before halting the program.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer status code, typically 0 for successful execution.
