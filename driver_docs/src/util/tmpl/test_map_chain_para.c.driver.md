# Purpose
This C source code file is designed to test the functionality and performance of a concurrent map and pool data structure implementation. The code defines a custom element structure `myele_t` and uses it to create a pool (`mypool`) and a map (`mymap`) by including parameterized implementations from external files (`fd_pool_para.c` and `fd_map_chain_para.c`). The file is structured as an executable program with a [`main`](#main) function that initializes the environment, sets up the data structures, and runs a series of tests to verify the correctness and concurrency capabilities of the map and pool.

The code is comprehensive in its testing approach, covering various operations such as insertion, removal, modification, and querying of elements in the map. It also tests transaction-based operations and parallel iteration over the map's chains. The program is designed to run in a multi-threaded environment, utilizing multiple "tiles" (threads) to simulate concurrent access and modification of the map. The use of assertions and logging throughout the code ensures that any errors or unexpected behavior are promptly identified and reported. The file serves as a robust test suite for validating the concurrent map and pool implementations, ensuring they function correctly under various conditions and configurations.
