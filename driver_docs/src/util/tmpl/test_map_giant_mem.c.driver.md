# Purpose
This C source code file is designed to test the functionality of a hash map implementation using a custom data structure called `pair_t`. The file includes two main components: sorting and mapping. The sorting functionality is provided by including a generic sorting implementation (`fd_sort.c`) that is customized for the `pair_t` structure, which consists of keys, next pointers, hash values, and additional data fields. The mapping functionality is implemented by including another generic component (`fd_map_giant.c`), which is configured to use `pair_t` as the map's data type, with specific fields designated for key, next pointer, and hash value. The code is structured as an executable program, with a [`main`](#main) function that initializes a random number generator, sets up test parameters, and performs a series of tests to verify the correctness of the map operations, including insertion, deletion, and iteration.

The primary purpose of this file is to validate the behavior of the hash map under various conditions, such as different insertion and deletion orders, and to ensure that the map maintains data integrity throughout these operations. The code includes extensive testing logic, using assertions to check the map's state and the correctness of operations like key equality, hashing, and memory alignment. The file also handles command-line arguments to configure the test parameters, such as the maximum number of elements, random seed, and iteration count. Overall, this file serves as a comprehensive test suite for the hash map implementation, ensuring its reliability and performance in handling dynamic data sets.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `../fd_util.h`
- `fd_sort.c`
- `fd_map_giant.c`


# Global Variables

---
### mem
- **Type**: `uchar array`
- **Description**: The `mem` variable is a global array of unsigned characters with a size of 32,768 bytes. It is aligned to a 128-byte boundary, which is specified by the `__attribute__((aligned(128)))` directive.
- **Use**: This variable is used as a memory buffer for operations that require specific alignment and size constraints, such as the creation and manipulation of a map data structure in the program.


# Data Structures

---
### pair
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `mykey`: A unique key of type ulong used to identify the pair.
    - `mynext`: A ulong value used to link to the next element in a data structure.
    - `myhash`: A ulong value representing the hash of the key for efficient lookup.
    - `val`: A uint value representing the data or value associated with the key.
    - `tag`: A uint value used as a marker or flag for various operations.
- **Description**: The `pair` structure is a compound data type designed to store a key-value pair with additional metadata for efficient data management and retrieval. It includes a unique key (`mykey`) for identification, a `mynext` field for linking elements, a `myhash` for hash-based operations, and a `val` field for storing the associated value. The `tag` field is used for marking or flagging purposes during operations such as iteration or validation. This structure is utilized in sorting and mapping operations, as indicated by its integration with sorting and mapping utilities in the provided code.

### pair\_t
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `mykey`: A unique key of type ulong used to identify the pair.
    - `mynext`: A ulong value used to link to the next element in a data structure.
    - `myhash`: A ulong value representing the hash of the key for efficient lookup.
    - `val`: A uint value representing the data or value associated with the key.
    - `tag`: A uint value used for tagging or marking purposes, often in iteration or validation.
- **Description**: The `pair_t` structure is a compound data type used to represent a key-value pair with additional metadata for efficient data management in hash maps or similar data structures. It includes a unique key (`mykey`), a link to the next element (`mynext`), a hash value for the key (`myhash`), a value associated with the key (`val`), and a tag for iteration or validation purposes (`tag`). This structure is designed to facilitate operations such as sorting and mapping, as evidenced by its integration with sorting and mapping utilities in the provided code.


# Functions

---
### shuffle\_pair<!-- {{#callable:shuffle_pair}} -->
The `shuffle_pair` function randomly shuffles an array of `pair_t` structures using the Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm.
- **Inputs**:
    - `rng`: A pointer to an `fd_rng_t` random number generator used to generate random indices for shuffling.
    - `pair`: A pointer to an array of `pair_t` structures that will be shuffled.
    - `cnt`: The number of elements in the `pair` array to shuffle.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function iterates over the array from the second element to the last (index 1 to cnt-1).
    - For each element at index `i`, it generates a random index `j` between 0 and `i` (inclusive) using `fd_rng_ulong_roll`.
    - It swaps the elements at indices `i` and `j` in the `pair` array.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it modifies the `pair` array in place to shuffle its elements.


---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function initializes a random number generator, sets up a map data structure, and performs a series of tests to verify the map's functionality, including insertion, deletion, and iteration over elements.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments passed to the program.
    - `argv`: An array of strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize the environment and parse command-line arguments for `--max`, `--seed`, and `--iter-max` with default values of 512, 1234, and 1000, respectively.
    - Log the testing parameters.
    - Initialize a random number generator.
    - Create two arrays `ref` and `tst` of `pair_t` structures, each with a maximum size of 512.
    - Check if `max` exceeds 512 and log a warning if so, then exit.
    - Populate `ref` and `tst` arrays with unique keys and random values, then sort `ref` in place.
    - Check the map's footprint and alignment requirements, logging a warning and exiting if they are not met.
    - Create a new map with the specified `max` and `seed`, and join it to obtain a usable map pointer.
    - Perform a series of tests to verify map operations, including key equality, hashing, copying, insertion, and deletion.
    - Iterate over the map to ensure all elements are correctly inserted and removed, logging progress every 100 iterations.
    - Shuffle the `tst` array to test insertion and deletion in random order.
    - Verify the map's state after each operation, ensuring it is empty or full as expected.
    - Leave and delete the map, ensuring proper cleanup of resources.
    - Log a success message and halt the program.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer status code, 0 on successful completion.
