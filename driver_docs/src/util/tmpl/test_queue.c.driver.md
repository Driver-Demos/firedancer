# Purpose
This C source code file is designed to test the functionality of a queue data structure, specifically focusing on its construction, accessors, and operations. The file includes a simple implementation of a circular buffer with a fixed maximum size (`TEST_QUEUE_MAX`) and provides basic operations such as [`buf_push`](#buf_push) and [`buf_pop`](#buf_pop) to manage the buffer's contents. The main function initializes a random number generator and performs a series of tests on the queue, including pushing and popping elements, as well as zero-copy operations, which allow direct manipulation of the queue's data without additional copying. The tests ensure that the queue behaves correctly under various conditions, including edge cases like being full or empty.

The file also includes a header file (`fd_util.h`) and another C file (`fd_queue.c`), indicating that it is part of a larger project or library. The code uses macros to define queue-related parameters and functions, suggesting that it is designed to be flexible and reusable. The use of `FD_TEST` macros throughout the code indicates a focus on validating the correctness of operations, making this file a critical component for ensuring the reliability of the queue implementation. The file is structured as an executable, with a [`main`](#main) function that orchestrates the testing process, and it does not define public APIs or external interfaces directly, but rather tests the functionality of the queue operations provided by the included files.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `../fd_util.h`
- `fd_queue.c`


# Global Variables

---
### buf
- **Type**: `int array`
- **Description**: The `buf` variable is a static integer array with a size defined by the macro `TEST_QUEUE_MAX`, which is set to 8. It is used to store integer values in a circular buffer fashion.
- **Use**: The `buf` array is used to hold elements in a queue-like structure, allowing for push and pop operations while maintaining a fixed maximum size.


---
### buf\_start
- **Type**: `ulong`
- **Description**: `buf_start` is a static global variable of type `ulong` that represents the starting index of a circular buffer used for queue operations. It is initialized to 0UL and is used to track the position from which elements are removed from the buffer.
- **Use**: `buf_start` is used to manage the position of the next element to be popped from the buffer in the `buf_pop` function.


---
### buf\_end
- **Type**: `ulong`
- **Description**: `buf_end` is a static global variable of type `ulong` that represents the index in the buffer array `buf` where the next element will be inserted. It is initialized to 0UL and is used to track the end of the queue in a circular buffer implementation.
- **Use**: `buf_end` is used to determine the position in the buffer where the next element should be pushed, and it wraps around when it reaches the maximum queue size.


---
### buf\_cnt
- **Type**: `ulong`
- **Description**: `buf_cnt` is a static global variable of type `ulong` that keeps track of the number of elements currently stored in the buffer `buf`. It is initialized to zero and is used to ensure that the buffer does not exceed its maximum capacity, defined by `TEST_QUEUE_MAX`. The variable is incremented when an element is pushed into the buffer and decremented when an element is popped from the buffer.
- **Use**: `buf_cnt` is used to manage the current count of elements in the buffer, ensuring operations respect the buffer's capacity constraints.


---
### scratch
- **Type**: `uchar array`
- **Description**: The `scratch` variable is a global array of unsigned characters with a size defined by `SCRATCH_FOOTPRINT`, which is 1024 bytes. It is aligned in memory according to `SCRATCH_ALIGN`, which is 128 bytes, to ensure optimal access and performance.
- **Use**: This variable is used as a memory buffer for operations involving the `test_queue` data structure, providing a scratch space for queue operations.


# Functions

---
### buf\_push<!-- {{#callable:buf_push}} -->
The `buf_push` function adds an integer to a circular buffer, updating the buffer's count and end index.
- **Inputs**:
    - `i`: The integer value to be added to the buffer.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function first checks if the buffer is not full using `FD_TEST(buf_cnt<TEST_QUEUE_MAX)`.
    - If the buffer is not full, it assigns the integer `i` to the current end position of the buffer `buf[buf_end]`.
    - It increments the buffer count `buf_cnt` and the end index `buf_end`.
    - If the end index `buf_end` reaches the maximum buffer size `TEST_QUEUE_MAX`, it wraps around to 0, maintaining the circular nature of the buffer.
- **Output**: This function does not return any value; it modifies the global buffer state.


---
### buf\_pop<!-- {{#callable:buf_pop}} -->
The `buf_pop` function removes and returns the integer at the start of a circular buffer, updating the buffer's start index and count.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if the buffer is not empty using `FD_TEST(buf_cnt)`.
    - Retrieve the integer at the current start index of the buffer and store it in variable `i`.
    - Decrement the buffer count `buf_cnt` to reflect the removal of an element.
    - Increment the start index `buf_start` to point to the next element in the buffer.
    - If the start index `buf_start` reaches the maximum buffer size `TEST_QUEUE_MAX`, reset it to 0 to maintain the circular nature of the buffer.
    - Return the integer `i` that was removed from the buffer.
- **Output**: The function returns the integer value that was at the start of the buffer before it was removed.


---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function initializes a random number generator, tests the construction and operations of a queue, and performs a series of randomized queue operations to validate its functionality.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments passed to the program.
    - `argv`: An array of strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize the program environment with `fd_boot` and set up a random number generator.
    - Log the start of queue construction testing and verify the alignment and footprint of the queue.
    - Create and join a new queue using a scratch buffer, logging the start of accessor testing.
    - Verify the maximum capacity and initial count of the queue.
    - Enter a loop to perform 100 million iterations of random queue operations, including push, pop, zero-copy push, and zero-copy pop, with occasional resets of the queue state.
    - For each operation, validate the queue's state and behavior using assertions.
    - After the loop, verify the queue can be properly left and deleted, and clean up the random number generator.
    - Log the successful completion of tests and halt the program.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer status code, `0`, indicating successful execution.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`buf_push`](#buf_push)
    - [`buf_pop`](#buf_pop)
