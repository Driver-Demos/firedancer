# Purpose
This C source code file is a comprehensive test suite for a B+ tree data structure implementation. The code is structured to test various functionalities of the B+ tree, such as insertion, deletion, querying, and iteration over elements. It includes a main function that initializes the environment, sets up memory allocation, and performs a series of tests to ensure the B+ tree operates correctly under different scenarios. The tests cover edge cases, such as handling empty trees, full trees, and verifying the integrity of the tree structure after various operations.

The file includes a custom memory allocator to manage memory usage efficiently during the tests, and it uses a random number generator to simulate different operations on the B+ tree. The code defines a `pair` structure to store key-value pairs, and it uses macros to configure the B+ tree's parameters, such as the maximum number of nodes and pairs. The test suite is designed to be thorough, checking the correctness of the B+ tree's behavior through assertions and logging notices to track progress and results. This file is intended to be an executable test program rather than a library or header file, as it contains a [`main`](#main) function and directly includes the B+ tree implementation file (`fd_bplus.c`) for testing purposes.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `../fd_util.h`
- `fd_bplus.c`


# Global Variables

---
### mem
- **Type**: `uchar array`
- **Description**: The `mem` variable is a static array of unsigned characters (uchar) with a size defined by the constant `MEM_SZ`, which is set to 1048576. It is aligned in memory according to the `MEM_ALIGN` constant, which is set to 128 bytes.
- **Use**: This variable is used as a memory pool for dynamic memory allocation within the program, ensuring that all allocations are aligned to `MEM_ALIGN`.


---
### mem\_used
- **Type**: `ulong`
- **Description**: The `mem_used` variable is a static global variable of type `ulong` that tracks the amount of memory currently used in the `mem` array. It is initialized to 0 and is updated as memory is allocated using the `ALLOC` macro.
- **Use**: `mem_used` is used to keep track of the memory footprint within the `mem` array, ensuring that allocations do not exceed the predefined memory size `MEM_SZ`.


# Data Structures

---
### pair
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `mykey`: An unsigned long integer representing the key of the pair.
    - `myval`: An unsigned long integer representing the value associated with the key.
- **Description**: The `pair` structure is a simple data structure that holds a key-value pair, where both the key and the value are of type `ulong`. This structure is typically used in contexts where pairs of related data need to be stored and accessed efficiently, such as in associative arrays or maps. The `mykey` member serves as the identifier for the pair, while `myval` holds the corresponding data value.


---
### pair\_t
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `mykey`: An unsigned long integer representing the key of the pair.
    - `myval`: An unsigned long integer representing the value associated with the key.
- **Description**: The `pair_t` data structure is a simple struct that encapsulates a key-value pair, where both the key and the value are of type `ulong`. This structure is used in conjunction with a B+ tree implementation, where `mykey` serves as the key for sorting and searching operations, and `myval` holds the associated data. The `pair_t` struct is fundamental in managing and organizing data within the B+ tree, allowing efficient insertion, deletion, and lookup operations.


# Functions

---
### ulong\_cmp<!-- {{#callable:ulong_cmp}} -->
The `ulong_cmp` function compares two unsigned long integers and returns an integer indicating their relative order.
- **Inputs**:
    - `_a`: A pointer to the first unsigned long integer to be compared.
    - `_b`: A pointer to the second unsigned long integer to be compared.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Dereferences the pointers `_a` and `_b` to obtain the unsigned long values `a` and `b`.
    - Compares `a` and `b` using less than and greater than operators.
    - Returns -1 if `a` is less than `b`, 1 if `a` is greater than `b`, and 0 if they are equal.
- **Output**: An integer: -1 if the first number is less than the second, 1 if greater, and 0 if they are equal.


---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function initializes and tests a B+ tree data structure by performing various operations such as insertion, querying, and deletion, while validating the tree's integrity and performance.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: An integer representing the number of command-line arguments.
    - `argv`: An array of strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize the environment and parse command-line arguments to set parameters for the B+ tree.
    - Create a random number generator and log the test parameters.
    - Allocate memory for pairs and initialize the pair count.
    - Perform initial tests on B+ tree construction and alignment properties.
    - Allocate shared memory for the B+ tree and test various invalid and valid B+ tree initializations.
    - Join the B+ tree and test its capacity by inserting elements until limits are reached.
    - Verify the inserted elements by querying and removing them, ensuring the tree is empty afterward.
    - Perform a series of random operations (query, insert, upsert, remove) on the B+ tree to test its functionality and integrity.
    - Test the B+ tree's iterator functions for both existing and non-existing keys.
    - Flush the B+ tree and verify it is empty.
    - Test the destruction of the B+ tree and clean up resources.
    - Log the success of the tests and halt the program.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer, 0, indicating successful execution.
