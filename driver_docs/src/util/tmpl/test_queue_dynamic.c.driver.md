# Purpose
This C source code file is designed to test the functionality of a dynamic queue implementation. It includes a simple circular buffer mechanism for managing integer data, with functions to push and pop elements. The file also integrates a more complex queue system from an external source, `fd_queue_dynamic.c`, which is included and utilized to perform various queue operations. The code is structured to test the queue's construction, accessors, and operations, ensuring that the queue behaves correctly under various conditions, including random operations and resets.

The main function initializes the environment, sets up a random number generator, and configures the maximum size of the queue. It then performs a series of tests on the queue, including pushing and popping elements, both with and without zero-copy operations. The code uses assertions to verify the correctness of each operation, ensuring that the queue's state matches expected values. The file is intended to be an executable test harness rather than a library or header file, as it contains a [`main`](#main) function and directly executes tests on the queue implementation. The use of logging and assertions indicates a focus on validating the queue's behavior and performance.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `../fd_util.h`
- `fd_queue_dynamic.c`


# Global Variables

---
### buf
- **Type**: `int array`
- **Description**: The `buf` variable is a static integer array with a size defined by the macro `BUF_MAX`, which is set to 8. It is used to store integer values in a circular buffer fashion.
- **Use**: This variable is used to hold elements in a circular buffer, allowing for efficient push and pop operations within the defined maximum size.


---
### buf\_start
- **Type**: `ulong`
- **Description**: `buf_start` is a static global variable of type `ulong` that represents the starting index of a circular buffer used in the program. It is initialized to 0UL and is used to track the position from which elements are removed from the buffer.
- **Use**: `buf_start` is used to manage the position of the next element to be popped from the circular buffer, ensuring correct buffer operations.


---
### buf\_end
- **Type**: `ulong`
- **Description**: `buf_end` is a static global variable of type `ulong` that represents the index position in the buffer array `buf` where the next element will be inserted. It is initialized to 0UL, indicating that the buffer is initially empty.
- **Use**: `buf_end` is used to track the end position of the buffer for insertion operations, wrapping around to 0 when it reaches the buffer's maximum capacity (`BUF_MAX`).


---
### buf\_cnt
- **Type**: `ulong`
- **Description**: `buf_cnt` is a static global variable of type `ulong` that keeps track of the number of elements currently stored in the buffer `buf`. It is initialized to zero and is used to ensure that the buffer does not exceed its maximum capacity, `BUF_MAX`. The variable is incremented when an element is pushed into the buffer and decremented when an element is popped from the buffer.
- **Use**: `buf_cnt` is used to manage the current count of elements in the buffer, ensuring operations respect the buffer's capacity constraints.


---
### scratch
- **Type**: `uchar array`
- **Description**: The `scratch` variable is a global array of unsigned characters with a size defined by `SCRATCH_FOOTPRINT`. It is aligned in memory according to `SCRATCH_ALIGN` using the `__attribute__((aligned(SCRATCH_ALIGN)))` directive.
- **Use**: This variable is used as a memory buffer for operations involving the `test_queue` data structure, providing a scratch space for queue operations.


# Functions

---
### buf\_push<!-- {{#callable:buf_push}} -->
The `buf_push` function adds an integer to a circular buffer, ensuring it does not exceed its maximum capacity.
- **Inputs**:
    - `i`: The integer value to be added to the buffer.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if the buffer count is less than the maximum buffer size using `FD_TEST` macro.
    - Assign the integer `i` to the current end position of the buffer array `buf`.
    - Increment the buffer count `buf_cnt` and the buffer end index `buf_end`.
    - If `buf_end` reaches or exceeds `BUF_MAX`, reset `buf_end` to 0 to maintain the circular nature of the buffer.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it modifies the global buffer state.


---
### buf\_pop<!-- {{#callable:buf_pop}} -->
The `buf_pop` function removes and returns the integer at the start of a circular buffer, updating the buffer's state accordingly.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if the buffer is not empty using `FD_TEST(buf_cnt)`; if empty, the function will not proceed.
    - Retrieve the integer at the current `buf_start` index of the buffer.
    - Decrement the buffer count `buf_cnt` to reflect the removal of an element.
    - Increment the `buf_start` index to point to the next element in the buffer.
    - If `buf_start` exceeds or equals `BUF_MAX`, reset `buf_start` to 0 to maintain the circular nature of the buffer.
    - Return the integer that was at the start of the buffer.
- **Output**: The function returns the integer value that was at the start of the buffer before it was removed.


---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function initializes a random number generator, configures and tests a dynamic queue with various operations, and logs the results.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments passed to the program.
    - `argv`: An array of strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize the program environment with `fd_boot` and set up a random number generator.
    - Parse the `--max` command-line argument to determine the maximum queue size, defaulting to `BUF_MAX`.
    - Check if the `max` value exceeds `BUF_MAX` or if the queue's alignment and footprint exceed predefined limits, logging warnings and exiting if so.
    - Log the maximum queue size and begin testing the queue's construction, ensuring alignment and footprint constraints are met.
    - Create and join a new queue using the `test_queue` functions, logging the success of these operations.
    - Test the queue's accessors to ensure the maximum size and initial count are correct.
    - Perform 100 million iterations of random queue operations, including push, pop, zero-copy push, and zero-copy pop, resetting the queue occasionally.
    - For each operation, verify the queue's state and contents using `FD_TEST` assertions.
    - After the loop, leave and delete the queue, ensuring the scratch space is correctly restored.
    - Delete the random number generator and log the successful completion of the tests before halting the program.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer status code, `0`, indicating successful execution.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`buf_push`](#buf_push)
    - [`buf_pop`](#buf_pop)
