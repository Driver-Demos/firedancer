# Purpose
The provided C code is a template for generating concurrent, persistent shared element pools, which are data structures that can hold a large number of elements and allow for fast acquisition and release operations. The implementation is based on a lock-free stack, utilizing atomic compare-and-swap operations to manage the stack's top element, making it suitable for concurrent usage on platforms that support atomic operations. The code is designed to be flexible and can be used to create pools that are optimized for different types of usage scenarios, such as inter-process communication, memory relocation, and serialization. The template allows for customization of various parameters, such as the element type, index type, and memory alignment, to suit specific application needs.

The code defines a set of macros and functions that provide a comprehensive API for managing these pools, including functions for creating, joining, leaving, and deleting pools, as well as acquiring and releasing elements. It also includes mechanisms for handling errors and verifying the integrity of the pool. The template is designed to be included in other C files, where it can be used to generate specific pool implementations by defining the necessary macros, such as `POOL_NAME` and `POOL_ELE_T`. This modular approach allows for the creation of multiple pool types within a single compilation unit, each with its own set of operations and characteristics.
# Imports and Dependencies

- `../bits/fd_bits.h`
- `../log/fd_log.h`


# Global Variables

---
### POOL\_
- **Type**: `function`
- **Description**: The `POOL_(lock)` function is a static function that attempts to lock a pool for exclusive access. It uses a test-and-test-and-set style to reduce contention and can operate in blocking or non-blocking mode.
- **Use**: This function is used to lock a pool, preventing concurrent acquire/release operations, and returns a success or error code based on the operation's outcome.


---
### pool
- **Type**: `POOL_(shmem_t) *`
- **Description**: The `pool` variable is a pointer to a `POOL_(shmem_t)` structure, which represents the shared memory segment of a pool in the local address space. This structure is used to manage the versioned index of the free stack top, which is crucial for the lock-free stack operations of the pool.
- **Use**: The `pool` variable is used to access and manipulate the shared memory segment of the pool, particularly for operations involving the versioned index of the free stack top.


---
### ele
- **Type**: `POOL_ELE_T *`
- **Description**: The variable `ele` is a pointer to a pool element type (`POOL_ELE_T`), which is defined as `myele_t` in the context of the pool implementation. It represents the location of the element store in the local address space.
- **Use**: `ele` is used to access and manage elements within a concurrent pool, allowing operations such as acquiring and releasing elements.


---
### ele\_max
- **Type**: `ulong`
- **Description**: The `ele_max` variable is a global variable of type `ulong` that represents the maximum capacity of the element store in a pool. It is initialized with the value of `join->ele_max`, indicating that it is set based on the element store capacity of a specific pool join.
- **Use**: `ele_max` is used to define the maximum number of elements that can be stored in the pool's element store.


---
### ele\_top
- **Type**: `ulong`
- **Description**: The `ele_top` variable is a global variable of type `ulong` that represents the versioned index of the free stack top in a lock-free stack implementation. It is used to manage the top of the stack in a concurrent element pool, where elements can be acquired and released efficiently.
- **Use**: `ele_top` is used to track the top of the stack in a concurrent pool, facilitating fast O(1) acquire and release operations.


---
### ver\_top
- **Type**: `ulong`
- **Description**: The `ver_top` variable is a global variable of type `ulong` that holds the versioned index of the free stack top in a lock-free stack-based pool implementation. It is used to manage the top of the stack, which can be in the range [0, ele_max) when not empty, or idx_null when empty.
- **Use**: `ver_top` is used to track the top of the free stack in a concurrent pool, facilitating atomic operations for acquiring and releasing elements.


---
### ver
- **Type**: `ulong`
- **Description**: The `ver` variable is an unsigned long integer that stores the version index of the free stack top in a concurrent persistent shared element pool. It is initialized using the `POOL_(private_vidx_ver)` function, which extracts the version from a versioned index.
- **Use**: This variable is used to manage versioning in the pool's lock-free stack to handle ABA problems and ensure safe concurrent operations.


# Functions

---
### POOL\_<!-- {{#callable:POOL_}} -->
The `POOL_(strerror)` function returns a human-readable string describing the error code passed to it.
- **Inputs**:
    - `err`: An integer representing an error code, which can be one of the predefined error codes such as FD_POOL_SUCCESS, FD_POOL_ERR_INVAL, FD_POOL_ERR_AGAIN, FD_POOL_ERR_CORRUPT, or FD_POOL_ERR_EMPTY.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function uses a switch statement to match the input error code `err` against predefined error codes.
    - For each case, it returns a corresponding string that describes the error, such as "success" for FD_POOL_SUCCESS or "bad input" for FD_POOL_ERR_INVAL.
    - If the error code does not match any predefined cases, the function returns "unknown".
- **Output**: A constant character pointer to a string that describes the error code.
