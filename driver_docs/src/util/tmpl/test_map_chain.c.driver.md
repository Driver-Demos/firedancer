# Purpose
This C source code file is an executable program designed to test and demonstrate the functionality of data structures and algorithms related to sorting, pooling, and mapping of elements, specifically using a custom data type `pair_t`. The code includes the implementation of a sorting algorithm, a pool allocator, and a hash map, all of which are tailored to work with the `pair_t` structure. The `pair_t` structure is defined with several fields, including keys and values, which are used in various operations throughout the program. The program is structured to perform a series of tests, including insertion, deletion, and iteration over the data structures, ensuring their correctness and efficiency.

The file includes several key components: it defines a `pair_t` structure, uses macros to configure and include external C files for sorting (`fd_sort.c`), pooling (`fd_pool.c`), and mapping (`fd_map_chain.c`), and implements a main function that orchestrates the testing process. The main function initializes a random number generator, sets up test parameters, and performs a series of operations to validate the behavior of the data structures. It also includes tests for edge cases and error handling, such as verifying memory alignment and handling invalid operations. The program is designed to be run in a hosted environment, as indicated by the conditional inclusion of system headers and the use of process control functions like `fork` and `wait`.

# Global Variables

---
### scratch
- **Type**: `uchar array`
- **Description**: The `scratch` variable is a global array of unsigned characters with a size defined by the macro `SCRATCH_SZ`, which is set to 32768. This array is used as a scratchpad memory area for temporary storage during the execution of the program.
- **Use**: The `scratch` array is used to allocate memory dynamically during the program's execution, particularly for operations that require temporary storage.


# Data Structures

---
### pair
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `mykey`: An unsigned integer representing the key of the pair.
    - `mynext`: An unsigned integer used to store the index of the next element in a linked list or pool.
    - `myprev`: An unsigned integer used to store the index of the previous element in a linked list or pool.
    - `val`: An unsigned integer representing the value associated with the key.
    - `tag`: An unsigned integer used as a tag for various purposes, such as marking or versioning.
- **Description**: The `pair` structure is a compound data type used to represent a key-value pair with additional linkage information for use in data structures like linked lists or hash maps. It contains fields for a key (`mykey`), a value (`val`), and two linkage fields (`mynext` and `myprev`) that facilitate navigation in linked data structures. The `tag` field is used for auxiliary purposes, such as marking or versioning elements during operations like sorting or shuffling.

### pair\_t
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `mykey`: An unsigned integer serving as the key for the pair.
    - `mynext`: An unsigned integer used to point to the next element in a linked list or chain.
    - `myprev`: An unsigned integer used to point to the previous element in a linked list or chain.
    - `val`: An unsigned integer representing the value associated with the key.
    - `tag`: An unsigned integer used for tagging or marking purposes.
- **Description**: The `pair_t` structure is a compound data type used to represent a key-value pair with additional linkage information for use in linked data structures. It contains fields for a key (`mykey`), a value (`val`), and two linkage fields (`mynext` and `myprev`) that facilitate its use in linked lists or chains. The `tag` field is used for marking or tagging purposes, which can be useful in various algorithms or operations involving the structure. This structure is utilized in sorting, pooling, and mapping operations as demonstrated in the accompanying code.


# Functions

---
### shuffle\_pair<!-- {{#callable:shuffle_pair}} -->
The `shuffle_pair` function randomly shuffles an array of `pair_t` structures using a given random number generator.
- **Inputs**:
    - `rng`: A pointer to an `fd_rng_t` random number generator used to generate random indices for shuffling.
    - `pair`: A pointer to an array of `pair_t` structures that will be shuffled.
    - `cnt`: The number of elements in the `pair` array to shuffle.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function iterates over the array from the second element to the last (index 1 to `cnt-1`).
    - For each element at index `i`, it generates a random index `j` between 0 and `i` (inclusive) using `fd_rng_ulong_roll`.
    - It swaps the elements at indices `i` and `j` in the `pair` array.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it modifies the `pair` array in place to shuffle its elements.


---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function initializes and tests a map data structure with various configurations and operations, including insertion, deletion, and iteration, while logging the process and handling errors.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments passed to the program.
    - `argv`: An array of strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize the environment and parse command-line arguments for configuration parameters such as pool size, chain count, seed, and iteration count.
    - Log the configuration parameters for testing.
    - Initialize a random number generator and create reference and test arrays of pairs with unique keys.
    - Sort the reference array in place and allocate memory for a pool using a custom allocator macro.
    - Join the pool and perform various tests on map properties and configurations, including chain count estimation and key hashing.
    - Iterate over a large number of random configurations to test map properties and key equality.
    - Allocate memory for the map and test map creation with various invalid configurations.
    - Join the map and verify its properties, such as chain count and seed.
    - Perform multiple iterations of inserting, querying, and removing elements from the map, ensuring correctness at each step.
    - Test additional map functionalities such as handholding and fast removal cases.
    - Log the completion of tests and clean up resources before exiting.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer, specifically 0, indicating successful execution and completion of all tests.
