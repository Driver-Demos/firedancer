# Purpose
The provided C code is a comprehensive implementation of a concurrent persistent shared map using chaining, designed to handle a large number of elements efficiently. This code is structured to support high concurrency with minimal conflicts, making it suitable for applications requiring fast and reliable access to shared data structures. The map operations, such as insert, remove, and modify, are optimized for O(1) time complexity, and the space overhead is also kept minimal. The implementation uses version numbers for each map chain to manage concurrent operations, ensuring that readers can process map keys without interference, while insert, remove, and modify operations are serialized to prevent conflicts.

The code is designed to be highly flexible and can be integrated with other data structures like pools, treaps, heaps, and lists. It supports various advanced features such as index compression, inter-process usage, and memory relocation, making it suitable for high-performance computing environments. The code provides a rich set of APIs for managing map operations, including speculative queries and transactional memory operations, which allow for complex operations involving multiple keys to be executed concurrently. The implementation also includes mechanisms for error handling and integrity verification, ensuring robustness in high-reliability applications. Overall, this code serves as a powerful tool for developers needing a concurrent map with high throughput and low latency in multi-threaded or distributed systems.

# Functions

### MAP\_<!-- {{#callable:MAP_}} -->
The `MAP_(query_try)` function attempts a speculative query on a map to find a key, returning success if found, or an error code if not found, locked, or corrupted.
- **Inputs**:
    - `join`: A pointer to a `MAP_(t)` structure representing the local join to the map.
    - `key`: A pointer to a `MAP_KEY_T` type representing the key to be queried in the map.
    - `sentinel`: A pointer to a `MAP_ELE_T` type used as a sentinel value if the key is not found.
    - `query`: A pointer to a `MAP_(query_t)` structure where the query result will be stored.
    - `flags`: An integer representing flags that modify the behavior of the query, such as using a hint for the key's hash.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Retrieve the map and element store from the `join` structure.
    - Calculate the hash of the key using the map's seed, unless a hint is used, to determine the chain to query.
    - Read the versioned count of the chain to check if it is locked or corrupted.
    - If the chain is locked or corrupted, return `FD_MAP_ERR_AGAIN` or `FD_MAP_ERR_CORRUPT` respectively.
    - Iterate over the elements in the chain, checking if the key matches any element.
    - If a matching key is found, update the query structure and return `FD_MAP_SUCCESS`.
    - If no match is found, perform additional checks to ensure the chain is valid and return `FD_MAP_ERR_KEY` if the key is not found.
- **Output**: Returns an integer status code: `FD_MAP_SUCCESS` if the key is found, `FD_MAP_ERR_KEY` if not found, `FD_MAP_ERR_AGAIN` if the chain is locked, or `FD_MAP_ERR_CORRUPT` if corruption is detected.

### MAP\_CRIT<!-- {{#callable:MAP_CRIT}} -->
The MAP_CRIT function attempts to lock a map chain for critical operations, handling potential blocking and corruption scenarios.
- **Inputs**:
    - `chain`: A pointer to the map chain that needs to be locked for critical operations.
    - `flags & FD_MAP_FLAG_BLOCKING`: A flag indicating whether the operation is allowed to block if the chain is already locked.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function attempts to lock the chain by checking if the chain's versioned count indicates it is unlocked.
    - If the chain is unlocked, it performs the critical operations within the block, updating the versioned count and unlocking the chain upon completion.
    - If the chain is locked, it handles the blocked scenario, either retrying or exiting based on the blocking flag.
    - The function ensures memory fences are used to maintain memory consistency before and after the critical section.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value but modifies the state of the map chain, potentially setting a retain_lock flag to indicate the lock should be retained for further operations.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`MAP_`](#MAP_)
