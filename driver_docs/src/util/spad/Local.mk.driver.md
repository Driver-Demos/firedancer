# Purpose
The file is a Makefile snippet used for building and testing components in a software project. It specifies the inclusion of a header file `fd_spad.h`, adds object files `fd_spad` and `fd_util` for compilation, defines a unit test named `test_spad` that depends on `fd_util`, and executes the unit test `test_spad`.
