# Purpose
This C source code file is a comprehensive test suite for a memory management system, specifically focusing on a stack-based allocator referred to as "spad" (short for stack pad). The code is structured to rigorously test various functionalities of the spad allocator, including memory allocation, alignment, trimming, and frame management. It uses a series of assertions and tests to ensure that the allocator behaves correctly under different conditions, such as varying alignment requirements and memory sizes. The code also includes tests for the allocator's ability to handle edge cases, such as zero-size allocations and non-multiple size allocations, and it verifies that memory is correctly poisoned and unpoisoned using AddressSanitizer (ASan) techniques to detect memory access errors.

The file is designed to be executed as a standalone program, as indicated by the presence of a [`main`](#main) function. It does not define public APIs or external interfaces but rather serves as an internal validation tool for developers to ensure the robustness and correctness of the spad allocator implementation. The code includes various static assertions to verify compile-time constants and uses a random number generator to simulate different allocation scenarios, providing broad coverage of potential use cases. Additionally, the code is structured to test the allocator's behavior in a multi-frame context, ensuring that memory is managed correctly across multiple push and pop operations.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `../fd_util.h`


# Global Variables

---
### mem
- **Type**: `uchar array`
- **Description**: The `mem` variable is a static array of unsigned characters (uchar) with a size defined by `FOOTPRINT_MAX`, which is set to 1048576. It is aligned according to `FD_SPAD_ALIGN` using the `__attribute__((aligned(FD_SPAD_ALIGN)))` directive, ensuring that the memory is properly aligned for efficient access.
- **Use**: This variable serves as a memory buffer for the `fd_spad` operations, providing a contiguous block of memory for allocation and management within the program.


# Functions

---
### test\_spad\_deepasan\_allocation<!-- {{#callable:test_spad_deepasan_allocation}} -->
The function `test_spad_deepasan_allocation` verifies the memory poisoning status of a given memory allocation in a shadow memory system, ensuring that the memory is correctly poisoned or unpoisoned based on its allocation status.
- **Inputs**:
    - `addr`: A pointer to the start of the allocated memory block to be tested.
    - `sz`: The size of the allocated memory block in bytes.
    - `is_first_alloc`: An integer flag indicating whether this is the first allocation (1 if true, 0 otherwise).
- **Control Flow**:
    - If `is_first_alloc` is false, it checks that the byte immediately before the allocated memory block is poisoned using `fd_asan_test` and expects a return value of 1.
    - It checks that the allocated memory block of size `sz` is unpoisoned using `fd_asan_query` and expects a return value of NULL.
    - It checks that the byte immediately after the allocated memory block is poisoned using `fd_asan_test` and expects a return value of 1.
- **Output**: The function does not return any value; it performs assertions to verify memory poisoning status.

### test\_spad\_deepasan<!-- {{#callable:test_spad_deepasan}} -->
The `test_spad_deepasan` function tests various memory allocation, alignment, and management operations on a stack-based allocator (`spad`) with deep ASAN (AddressSanitizer) checks.
- **Inputs**:
    - `spad`: A pointer to an `fd_spad_t` structure representing the stack-based allocator to be tested.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function begins by resetting the `spad` and pushing a new frame onto the stack.
    - It tests a basic non-8-byte aligned allocation by allocating 12 bytes and verifies the allocation using [`test_spad_deepasan_allocation`](#test_spad_deepasan_allocation).
    - A new frame is pushed, and a 20-byte allocation is tested, followed by trimming the allocation to 15 bytes and verifying it.
    - The prepare-then-cancel API is tested by preparing a 50-byte allocation, checking memory poisoning, canceling the allocation, and verifying the memory state.
    - The prepare-then-publish API is tested by preparing and publishing a 50-byte allocation and verifying it.
    - The prepare-then-alloc and prepare-then-trim APIs are tested by preparing a 50-byte allocation, allocating it, trimming it, and verifying memory poisoning.
    - The prepare, push, and pop APIs are tested by preparing a 32-byte aligned allocation, pushing a frame, and verifying memory poisoning after push and pop operations.
    - Memory access after popping frames is tested to ensure memory is poisoned as expected.
    - Finally, the `spad` is reset to its initial state.
- **Output**: The function does not return any value; it performs tests and assertions to verify the behavior of the `spad` allocator.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`test_spad_deepasan_allocation`](#test_spad_deepasan_allocation)

### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function initializes the environment, tests memory allocation and management functions, and validates the behavior of a shared memory allocator with various operations and constraints.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments passed to the program.
    - `argv`: An array of strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize the environment using `fd_boot` with command-line arguments.
    - Retrieve the maximum memory size (`mem_max`) from command-line arguments or use a default value.
    - Log the memory size being tested.
    - Initialize a random number generator (`rng`).
    - Perform a series of tests on memory alignment and footprint calculations for 1,000,000 iterations.
    - Validate constructors for shared memory allocation with various constraints and conditions.
    - Join the shared memory and test accessors for frame and memory management.
    - Perform allocation tests with different alignment and size constraints, including edge cases for zero and non-multiple sizes.
    - Test frame push and pop operations, ensuring correct frame usage and memory management.
    - Conduct random allocation tests using both direct allocation and prepare/cancel/publish mechanisms.
    - Validate allocations and ensure no memory overlap occurs.
    - Test frame-based memory management using `FD_SPAD_FRAME_BEGIN` and `FD_SPAD_FRAME_END` macros.
    - If `FD_HAS_DEEPASAN` is defined, perform additional deep ASAN tests for memory safety.
    - Test destructors for leaving and deleting shared memory, ensuring proper cleanup.
    - Log a success message and halt the program.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer, specifically 0, indicating successful execution.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`test_spad_deepasan`](#test_spad_deepasan)

### FD\_SPAD\_FRAME\_BEGIN<!-- {{#callable:main::FD_SPAD_FRAME_BEGIN::FD_SPAD_FRAME_BEGIN}} -->
The `FD_SPAD_FRAME_BEGIN` function is a macro that manages a stack frame within a shared memory space, ensuring that the frame usage is correctly tracked and allowing for conditional early exit from the frame.
- **Inputs**:
    - `spad`: A pointer to the shared memory space (fd_spad_t) where the frame operations are being performed.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function begins by asserting that the current frame usage of 'spad' is 2 using `FD_TEST(fd_spad_frame_used(spad) == 2UL)`.
    - A random number is generated using `fd_rng_uint(rng)` and checked if the least significant bit is set; if so, the loop is exited using `break`.
    - If the loop is not exited, a dummy operation is performed by incrementing `dummy[0]`.
    - The function asserts again that the frame usage of 'spad' is still 2 after the dummy operation.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it is a macro that manipulates the state of the shared memory frame and may conditionally exit the frame early.
