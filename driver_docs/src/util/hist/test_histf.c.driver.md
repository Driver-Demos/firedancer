# Purpose
This C source code file is a test suite for a histogram data structure, specifically designed to validate the functionality and performance of the `fd_histf_t` type and its associated operations. The code includes a series of tests that verify the alignment and memory footprint of the histogram structure, as well as its ability to correctly sample and count values within specified ranges. The [`assert_range`](#assert_range) function is a key component, ensuring that the histogram correctly tracks the number of samples within given boundaries. The main function orchestrates the testing process, initializing the histogram, performing a series of sample operations, and checking the results against expected outcomes.

The file also includes performance testing to measure the time taken to sample a large number of values, excluding the overhead of random number generation. This is achieved by using a random number generator to produce sample values and then recording the time taken to process these samples through the histogram. The code is structured to ensure that all operations are thoroughly tested, including the creation, joining, sampling, and deletion of the histogram. The use of logging and assertions throughout the code provides clear feedback on the success or failure of each test, making it a comprehensive tool for validating the histogram's implementation.

# Functions

### assert\_range<!-- {{#callable:assert_range}} -->
The `assert_range` function verifies that a specified range of histogram buckets in a floating-point histogram matches expected values and updates correctly when sampled.
- **Inputs**:
    - `hist`: A pointer to an `fd_histf_t` histogram structure.
    - `idx`: An unsigned long integer representing the index of the histogram bucket to be tested.
    - `left_edge`: An unsigned integer representing the left edge of the range to be tested (exclusive).
    - `right_edge`: An unsigned integer representing the right edge of the range to be tested (exclusive).
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function begins by asserting that the left and right edges of the histogram bucket at the given index match the provided `left_edge` and `right_edge` values using `FD_TEST`.
    - It initializes `expected` with the current count of the histogram bucket and `initial_sum` with the total sum of the histogram.
    - The function samples the histogram at `left_edge-1UL` and asserts that the count of the bucket remains unchanged.
    - A loop iterates over the range from `left_edge` to `right_edge`, sampling each value and asserting that the bucket count increments as expected.
    - After the loop, the function samples the histogram at `right_edge` and asserts that the bucket count remains unchanged.
    - Finally, it asserts that the total sum of the histogram matches the expected sum after the operations.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it uses assertions to verify the correctness of the histogram's state.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`fd_histf_left`](fd_histf.h.driver.md#fd_histf_left)
    - [`fd_histf_right`](fd_histf.h.driver.md#fd_histf_right)
    - [`fd_histf_cnt`](fd_histf.h.driver.md#fd_histf_cnt)
    - [`fd_histf_sum`](fd_histf.h.driver.md#fd_histf_sum)
    - [`fd_histf_sample`](fd_histf.h.driver.md#fd_histf_sample)

### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function initializes and tests a histogram data structure, performs sampling, and measures performance.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments passed to the program.
    - `argv`: An array of strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize the environment with `fd_boot` and log the start of testing align and footprint.
    - Verify alignment and footprint of the histogram structure using `FD_TEST`.
    - Allocate memory for the histogram and initialize it with [`fd_histf_new`](fd_histf.h.driver.md#fd_histf_new), then verify the allocation.
    - Join the histogram with [`fd_histf_join`](fd_histf.h.driver.md#fd_histf_join) and verify the join operation.
    - Test the sampling functionality by checking initial counts, sampling values, and verifying counts again.
    - Sample values into the histogram and verify the counts for underflow and overflow buckets.
    - Reinitialize the histogram with new parameters and verify the range of each bucket using [`assert_range`](#assert_range).
    - Verify the bucket count of the histogram with `FD_TEST`.
    - Measure and log the performance of sampling operations excluding random number generation overhead.
    - Leave the histogram with [`fd_histf_leave`](fd_histf.h.driver.md#fd_histf_leave) and verify the operation.
    - Delete the histogram with [`fd_histf_delete`](fd_histf.h.driver.md#fd_histf_delete), free the allocated memory, and log the successful completion of tests.
    - Call `fd_halt` to terminate the program.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer value of 0, indicating successful execution.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`fd_histf_align`](fd_histf.h.driver.md#fd_histf_align)
    - [`fd_histf_footprint`](fd_histf.h.driver.md#fd_histf_footprint)
