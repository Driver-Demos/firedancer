# Purpose
This C source code file implements a command-line utility for managing a data structure known as a "pod" within a shared memory workspace. The code provides a broad range of functionalities, including creating, deleting, resetting, listing, inserting, removing, updating, and querying pods. The main technical components include functions for handling different data types, such as strings, integers, and floating-point numbers, and operations on these data types within the pod structure. The code also includes error handling and logging to ensure robust operation and user feedback.

The file is structured as an executable program, with a [`main`](#main) function that processes command-line arguments to execute various commands related to pod management. It defines a public API for interacting with pods through command-line commands, such as "new," "delete," "insert," and "query." The code relies on several external utilities and libraries, such as `fd_util.h` and `fd_pod.h`, to perform its operations. The program is designed to be run in a hosted environment, as indicated by the `FD_HAS_HOSTED` preprocessor directive, and it includes comprehensive error checking and logging to facilitate debugging and user guidance.

# Functions

---
### supported\_val\_type<!-- {{#callable:supported_val_type}} -->
The `supported_val_type` function checks if a given value type is supported by comparing it against a predefined set of constants.
- **Inputs**:
    - `val_type`: An integer representing the value type to be checked for support.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function uses a series of bitwise OR operations to compare the input `val_type` against a list of predefined constants representing supported value types.
    - If `FD_HAS_DOUBLE` is defined, the function also checks if `val_type` is equal to `FD_POD_VAL_TYPE_DOUBLE`.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer that is non-zero if the `val_type` is supported, and zero if it is not.


---
### insert\_val<!-- {{#callable:insert_val}} -->
The `insert_val` function inserts a value of a specified type into a POD (Plain Old Data) structure at a given path.
- **Inputs**:
    - `pod`: A pointer to the POD structure where the value will be inserted.
    - `path`: A constant character pointer representing the path within the POD where the value should be inserted.
    - `val_type`: An integer representing the type of the value to be inserted, which determines the conversion and insertion function to use.
    - `val`: A constant character pointer to the value to be inserted, which will be converted to the appropriate type based on `val_type`.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function begins by declaring a variable `off` to store the offset of the inserted value.
    - A switch statement is used to determine the type of the value (`val_type`) and execute the corresponding insertion function.
    - For each case in the switch statement, the function converts the input value `val` to the appropriate type using a conversion function (e.g., `fd_cstr_to_cstr`, `fd_cstr_to_char`, etc.) and then calls the corresponding POD insertion function (e.g., `fd_pod_insert_cstr`, `fd_pod_insert_char`, etc.) to insert the value into the POD at the specified path.
    - If the `val_type` is not recognized, the function logs an error and should never reach this point.
    - The function returns the offset `off` where the value was inserted in the POD.
- **Output**: The function returns an unsigned long integer representing the offset in the POD where the value was inserted.


---
### issingleprint<!-- {{#callable:issingleprint}} -->
The `issingleprint` function checks if a given character is alphanumeric, a punctuation mark, or a space.
- **Inputs**:
    - `c`: An integer representing a character to be checked.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function uses bitwise OR operations to combine the results of three checks: `fd_isalnum(c)`, `fd_ispunct(c)`, and `(c == ' ')`.
    - `fd_isalnum(c)` checks if the character is alphanumeric.
    - `fd_ispunct(c)` checks if the character is a punctuation mark.
    - `(c == ' ')` checks if the character is a space.
- **Output**: The function returns a non-zero integer if the character is alphanumeric, a punctuation mark, or a space; otherwise, it returns zero.


---
### printf\_path<!-- {{#callable:printf_path}} -->
The `printf_path` function constructs and prints the path of a node in a hierarchical structure by concatenating the keys from the node to the root.
- **Inputs**:
    - `info`: A pointer to a `fd_pod_info_t` structure representing the node whose path is to be printed.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if the input `info` is NULL and return immediately if it is.
    - Initialize a pointer `node` to `info` and a size variable `sz` to 0.
    - Iterate through the nodes from `info` to the root, accumulating the size of each node's key in `sz`.
    - Allocate a buffer `buf` of size `sz` to hold the concatenated path string.
    - If the buffer allocation fails, return immediately.
    - Initialize a pointer `p` to the end of the buffer and a flag `subpod` to 0.
    - Iterate through the nodes again, copying each node's key into the buffer in reverse order, adding a '.' separator if `subpod` is set.
    - Set `subpod` to 1 after the first key is copied to ensure subsequent keys are followed by a '.'
    - Print the constructed path stored in `buf`.
    - Free the allocated buffer.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it prints the constructed path to the standard output.


---
### printf\_val<!-- {{#callable:printf_val}} -->
The `printf_val` function prints the value of a POD (Plain Old Data) element based on its type, formatting the output accordingly.
- **Inputs**:
    - `info`: A pointer to a constant `fd_pod_info_t` structure containing information about the POD element, including its type and value.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function begins by checking the `val_type` field of the `info` structure to determine the type of the POD element.
    - If the type is `FD_POD_VAL_TYPE_SUBPOD`, it prints the maximum, used, and key count of the subpod.
    - If the type is `FD_POD_VAL_TYPE_BUF`, it prints the size of the buffer and iterates over the buffer to print its contents in a formatted manner, including both hexadecimal and character representations.
    - If the type is `FD_POD_VAL_TYPE_CSTR`, it prints the string value or "(null)" if the size is zero.
    - If the type is `FD_POD_VAL_TYPE_CHAR`, it prints the character if printable, otherwise its hexadecimal value.
    - For `FD_POD_VAL_TYPE_UCHAR`, `FD_POD_VAL_TYPE_USHORT`, `FD_POD_VAL_TYPE_UINT`, and `FD_POD_VAL_TYPE_ULONG`, it decodes and prints the unsigned integer value.
    - For `FD_POD_VAL_TYPE_SCHAR`, `FD_POD_VAL_TYPE_SHORT`, `FD_POD_VAL_TYPE_INT`, and `FD_POD_VAL_TYPE_LONG`, it decodes and prints the signed integer value.
    - If `FD_HAS_INT128` is defined, it handles `FD_POD_VAL_TYPE_INT128` and `FD_POD_VAL_TYPE_UINT128` by decoding and printing the 128-bit integer values in hexadecimal format.
    - For `FD_POD_VAL_TYPE_FLOAT`, it prints the float value in scientific notation.
    - If `FD_HAS_DOUBLE` is defined, it handles `FD_POD_VAL_TYPE_DOUBLE` by printing the double value in scientific notation.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it outputs formatted data to the standard output (stdout).
- **Functions called**:
    - [`issingleprint`](#issingleprint)


---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function initializes the program, checks for valid command-line arguments, and logs a notice before halting the program.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments passed to the program.
    - `argv`: An array of strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Call `fd_boot` to initialize the program with the command-line arguments.
    - Check if `argc` is less than 1, and if so, log an error and terminate the program.
    - Check if `argc` is greater than 1, and if so, log an error indicating the platform is not supported and terminate the program.
    - Log a notice indicating that 0 commands were processed.
    - Call `fd_halt` to perform any necessary cleanup before exiting.
    - Return 0 to indicate successful execution.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer value of 0, indicating successful execution.
