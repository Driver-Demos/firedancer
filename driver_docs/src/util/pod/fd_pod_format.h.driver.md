# Purpose
The provided C header file, `fd_pod_format.h`, is designed to facilitate formatted operations on a data structure referred to as a "pod." This file defines a set of inline functions that allow for inserting, replacing, and querying various data types within a pod using formatted string paths. The operations are implemented for a variety of data types, including integers, floating-point numbers, and character types, and are extended to support double precision if available. The functions utilize variadic arguments and the `vsnprintf` function to construct paths from format strings, which are then used to interact with the pod.

The file is structured to provide a consistent interface for manipulating pod data, with macros used to generate type-specific functions for each operation. These operations are marked as "invalidating," indicating that they may alter the state of the pod in a way that affects its integrity or the validity of previously obtained references. The header file does not define a main function or executable code; instead, it is intended to be included in other C source files where these pod operations are needed. The use of `__attribute__ ((format (printf, ...)))` ensures that the format strings are checked for correctness, similar to standard `printf` functions, enhancing the robustness of the code.

### fd\_pod\_insertf\_cstr
- **Type**: `static inline ulong`
- **Description**: The `fd_pod_insertf_cstr` function is a static inline function that inserts a C-style string (`str`) into a pod data structure at a path specified by a formatted string (`fmt`). It uses variadic arguments to construct the path and returns the offset where the string was inserted, or 0 on failure.
- **Use**: This function is used to insert a C-style string into a pod at a dynamically constructed path, with the path being specified using a format string and additional arguments.


# Functions

---
### fd\_pod\_queryf\_subpod<!-- {{#callable:fd_pod_queryf_subpod}} -->
The `fd_pod_queryf_subpod` function queries a subpod from a given pod using a formatted path string.
- **Inputs**:
    - `pod`: A pointer to the constant unsigned character array representing the pod to be queried.
    - `fmt`: A constant character pointer representing the format string used to construct the path for querying the subpod.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize a variable argument list `ap` and start it with `va_start` using the format string `fmt`.
    - Declare a buffer `buf` of size 128 to store the formatted path string.
    - Use `vsnprintf` to format the path string into `buf` using the variable argument list `ap`.
    - Calculate the length of the formatted string using `fd_ulong_if` to ensure it is within bounds and null-terminate `buf`.
    - End the variable argument list with `va_end`.
    - Check if the formatted string length is invalid (negative or exceeds buffer size), and return `0UL` if so.
    - Call `fd_pod_query_subpod` with the pod and formatted path string `buf` to perform the query and return the result.
- **Output**: A constant unsigned character pointer to the queried subpod, or `0UL` if the query fails due to formatting errors.

### fd\_pod\_queryf\_cstr<!-- {{#callable:fd_pod_queryf_cstr}} -->
The `fd_pod_queryf_cstr` function queries a POD (Plain Old Data) structure for a C-string value at a path specified by a formatted string, returning a default value if the query fails.
- **Inputs**:
    - `pod`: A pointer to the POD structure from which the C-string is queried.
    - `def`: A default C-string value to return if the query fails.
    - `fmt`: A format string that specifies the path within the POD structure.
    - `...`: Additional arguments for the format string.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize a variable argument list with `va_start` using the format string `fmt`.
    - Use `vsnprintf` to format the path into a buffer `buf` of size 128, using the variable argument list.
    - Calculate the length of the formatted string, ensuring it does not exceed the buffer size, and null-terminate the string.
    - End the variable argument list with `va_end`.
    - Check if the formatted string length is invalid (negative or exceeds buffer size), returning 0 if so.
    - Call `fd_pod_query_cstr` with the formatted path to retrieve the C-string from the POD, returning the default value `def` if the query fails.
- **Output**: Returns a pointer to the queried C-string from the POD, or the default value `def` if the query fails.
