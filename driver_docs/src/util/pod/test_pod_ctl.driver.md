# Purpose
This Bash script is a test suite designed to validate the functionality of a command-line tool, `fd_pod_ctl`, which appears to manage some form of data structure or resource referred to as a "pod." The script provides narrow functionality, focusing specifically on testing various operations such as creating, inserting, updating, querying, listing, removing, resetting, and deleting pods. It sets up a test environment by creating temporary files and a workspace, executes a series of tests to ensure that `fd_pod_ctl` handles both expected and erroneous inputs correctly, and cleans up the environment afterward. The script is not an executable or a library but rather a utility for automated testing, ensuring that the `fd_pod_ctl` tool behaves as expected under different scenarios.
# Global Variables

---
### UNIT\_TEST
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: The `UNIT_TEST` variable is a string that holds the directory path of the script's source file. It is determined using the `dirname` command on the `$BASH_SOURCE` variable, which contains the path of the script being executed.
- **Use**: This variable is used to determine the location of binaries relative to the script's directory.


---
### BUILD
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: The `BUILD` variable is a global string variable that holds the directory path of the build directory. It is determined by taking the directory name of the `UNIT_TEST` variable, which itself is derived from the directory of the current script (`$BASH_SOURCE`).
- **Use**: This variable is used to construct the path to the `bin` directory, which is stored in the `BIN` variable, and is subsequently used to execute various commands in the script.


---
### BIN
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: The `BIN` variable is a string that holds the path to the 'bin' directory within the build directory. It is constructed by appending '/bin' to the `BUILD` variable, which itself is derived from the directory of the unit test script.
- **Use**: This variable is used to specify the location of the binary files that are executed throughout the script for various testing operations.


---
### WKSP
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: The `WKSP` variable is a string that holds the name of a workspace file, specifically 'test_fd_pod_ctl.wksp'. This variable is used throughout the script to reference the workspace being manipulated by various commands.
- **Use**: `WKSP` is used to specify the workspace file for operations such as creation, deletion, and manipulation within the script.


---
### PAGE\_CNT
- **Type**: `integer`
- **Description**: The variable `PAGE_CNT` is a global integer variable initialized to 1. It represents the number of pages to be used when creating a new workspace in the script.
- **Use**: `PAGE_CNT` is used as an argument in the command to create a new workspace, specifying the number of pages to allocate.


---
### PAGE\_SZ
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: The variable `PAGE_SZ` is a global variable defined as a string with the value 'gigantic'. It is used to specify the size of a page in the context of workspace management for the script.
- **Use**: `PAGE_SZ` is used as an argument when creating a new workspace with the `fd_wksp_ctl` command.


---
### CPU\_IDX
- **Type**: `integer`
- **Description**: The `CPU_IDX` variable is a global integer variable set to 0. It is used to specify the CPU index for operations related to workspace management in the script.
- **Use**: `CPU_IDX` is used as a parameter when creating a new workspace with the `fd_wksp_ctl` command.


---
### MODE
- **Type**: `integer`
- **Description**: The variable `MODE` is a global variable set to the integer value `0600`. This value represents file permissions in octal notation, commonly used in Unix-like operating systems to define read, write, and execute permissions for the owner, group, and others.
- **Use**: `MODE` is used to specify the permissions for a new workspace created by the `fd_wksp_ctl` command.


---
### BADFILE
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: The `BADFILE` variable is a global variable that holds the path to a temporary file created using the `mktemp` command. It is immediately deleted after its creation with `rm -f "$BADFILE"`, indicating that it is intended to represent a non-existent or invalid file path for testing purposes.
- **Use**: `BADFILE` is used to simulate an invalid file path scenario in the script's test cases.


---
### EMPTYFILE
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: The `EMPTYFILE` variable is a global variable that holds the path to a temporary file created using the `mktemp` command. This file is intended to be empty and is used in various test cases within the script.
- **Use**: `EMPTYFILE` is used to store the path of an empty temporary file for testing purposes, and it is cleaned up after the tests are completed.


---
### TMPFILE
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: The `TMPFILE` variable is a global variable that holds the path to a temporary file created using the `mktemp` command. This file is initialized with the text 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog'. It is used throughout the script for various testing purposes, particularly in the 'insert-file' test section.
- **Use**: `TMPFILE` is used to store a temporary file path for testing file operations in the script.


---
### FD\_LOG\_PATH
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: FD_LOG_PATH is a global variable that is initialized as an empty string. It is intended to specify the path for logging, but in this script, it is set to an empty value, effectively disabling logging.
- **Use**: This variable is used to control the logging path for the script, but it is currently set to disable logging by being an empty string.


---
### POD
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: The variable `POD` is a global string variable that stores the identifier of a newly created pod. It is assigned the output of the command `$BIN/fd_pod_ctl new "$WKSP" 4096`, which is expected to return a pod identifier if successful. This identifier is used in subsequent commands to perform various operations on the pod.
- **Use**: `POD` is used to store and reference the identifier of a pod for subsequent operations in the script.


# Functions

---
### fail
The `fail` function cleans up temporary files and logs an error message before exiting the script with a failure status.
- **Inputs**:
    - `$1`: A string representing the context or name of the operation that failed.
    - `$2`: An integer representing the unexpected exit code of the failed operation.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Remove the files specified by the variables `EMPTYFILE` and `TMPFILE` using `rm -f` to ensure they are deleted without prompting.
    - Print an error message to standard output indicating the failure context and the unexpected exit code.
    - Print a message indicating that the log is not available.
    - Exit the script with a status code of 1 to indicate failure.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it exits the script with a status code of 1 after performing cleanup and logging.
