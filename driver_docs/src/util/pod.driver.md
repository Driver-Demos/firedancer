## Files
- **[fd_pod.c](pod/fd_pod.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_pod.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase provides functions and macros for managing and manipulating a hierarchical data structure called a "pod," including operations for querying, listing, counting, resizing, compacting, and removing key-value pairs within the pod.
- **[fd_pod.h](pod/fd_pod.h.driver.md)**: The `fd_pod.h` file in the `firedancer` codebase provides a set of APIs for managing flexible hierarchies of typed key-value pairs in a compact, contiguous in-memory data structure called a pod, which supports serialization, deserialization, and various data types, including nested pods.
- **[fd_pod_ctl.c](pod/fd_pod_ctl.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_pod_ctl.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase implements a command-line utility for managing and manipulating POD (Plain Old Data) structures, including operations like creating, deleting, resetting, listing, inserting, removing, updating, and querying PODs.
- **[fd_pod_ctl_help](pod/fd_pod_ctl_help.driver.md)**: The `fd_pod_ctl_help` file provides detailed usage instructions for the `fd_pod_ctl` command-line tool, which manages operations on pods such as creation, deletion, insertion, querying, and compaction within the `firedancer` codebase.
- **[fd_pod_format.h](pod/fd_pod_format.h.driver.md)**: The `fd_pod_format.h` file in the `firedancer` codebase provides macros and inline functions for inserting, replacing, and querying various data types in a pod structure using formatted paths.
- **[Local.mk](pod/Local.mk.driver.md)**: The `Local.mk` file in the `firedancer` codebase specifies build instructions for headers, objects, unit tests, binaries, and test scripts related to the `fd_pod` and `fd_util` components.
- **[test_pod.c](pod/test_pod.c.driver.md)**: The `test_pod.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase contains a comprehensive set of unit tests for the `fd_pod` utility, verifying various functionalities such as alignment, footprint, value type conversions, and insertion and querying of different data types in a POD (Plain Old Data) structure.
- **[test_pod_ctl](pod/test_pod_ctl.driver.md)**: The `test_pod_ctl` file is a Bash script for testing various functionalities of the `fd_pod_ctl` command in the `firedancer` codebase, including operations like creating, inserting, updating, querying, listing, removing, resetting, and deleting pods.
