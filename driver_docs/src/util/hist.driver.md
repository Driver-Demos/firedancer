## Files
- **[fd_histf.h](hist/fd_histf.h.driver.md)**: The `fd_histf.h` file in the `firedancer` codebase provides an implementation of simple, fast, fixed-size exponential histograms with bucketed values and overflow handling.
- **[Local.mk](hist/Local.mk.driver.md)**: The `Local.mk` file in the `firedancer` codebase specifies the inclusion of the `fd_histf.h` header and defines a unit test named `test_histf` for the `fd_util` component.
- **[test_histf.c](hist/test_histf.c.driver.md)**: The `test_histf.c` file contains a comprehensive set of unit tests for the `fd_histf_t` histogram functionality in the `firedancer` codebase, including tests for alignment, footprint, sampling, range assertions, bucket counts, and performance.
