# Purpose
The provided content is a Makefile script used for building and testing components of a software project. It utilizes a series of custom macros, such as `make-lib`, `add-hdrs`, `add-objs`, `make-unit-test`, and `run-unit-test`, to streamline the process of compiling libraries, adding headers, and managing object files. The script specifically focuses on the `fd_util` library, adding its headers and object files, and setting up unit tests for `test_util` and `test_util_base`. The conditional block checks for the presence of the `FD_HAS_UBSAN` flag, which, if not defined, allows the `test_util_base` unit test to be built and run. This test is designed to diagnose compatibility issues with the build target and the FD machine model, particularly by probing undefined or implementation-defined behaviors, and is expected to fail under certain conditions like when using the Undefined Behavior Sanitizer (UBSan).
