# Purpose
The file is a Makefile snippet used in a build system to manage dependencies. It utilizes the `add-hdrs` and `add-objs` functions to include the header file `fd_textstream.h` and the object files `fd_textstream` and `fd_util` in the build process, ensuring they are compiled and linked appropriately.
