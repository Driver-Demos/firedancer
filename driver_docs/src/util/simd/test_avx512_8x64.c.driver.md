# Purpose
This C source code file is a comprehensive test suite for verifying the functionality of operations on two custom data types, `wwl_t` and `wwv_t`, which appear to be vector types designed to handle operations on arrays of long integers and unsigned long integers, respectively. The code is structured to perform a series of tests on these data types, including construction, arithmetic operations, bitwise operations, and various utility functions like broadcasting, zeroing, and conditional operations. The tests are executed in a loop, iterating a million times to ensure robustness and correctness of the operations under various conditions. The file includes tests for loading and storing data, arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and bitwise operations like AND, OR, XOR, and shifts. It also tests more complex operations like permutations, selections, and conditional operations based on a mask.

The code is intended to be executed as a standalone program, as indicated by the presence of a [`main`](#main) function, and it does not define any public APIs or external interfaces. It relies on a random number generator to produce test data, ensuring that the tests cover a wide range of input scenarios. The use of macros and helper functions like `WWL_TEST` and `WWV_TEST` suggests a focus on automated testing, with the results likely being logged or asserted to verify correctness. The file is part of a larger testing framework, as indicated by the inclusion of a header file `test_avx512.h`, which likely contains definitions and declarations necessary for the tests, such as the `wwl_t` and `wwv_t` types and their associated operations.

# Functions

---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function initializes a random number generator and performs extensive testing on two data types, `wwl_t` and `wwv_t`, by executing various operations and verifying their correctness through a series of tests.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: An integer representing the number of command-line arguments.
    - `argv`: An array of strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize the program with `fd_boot` using command-line arguments.
    - Create and join a random number generator `rng`.
    - Log the start of testing for `wwl_t`.
    - Enter a loop to perform 1,000,000 iterations of tests on `wwl_t`.
    - Generate random long integers and construct `wwl_t` objects `x`, `y`, and `z`.
    - Perform various tests on `wwl_t` objects including construction, permutation, selection, broadcasting, arithmetic, bitwise operations, and comparisons.
    - Log the start of testing for `wwv_t`.
    - Enter a loop to perform 1,000,000 iterations of tests on `wwv_t`.
    - Generate random unsigned long integers and construct `wwv_t` objects `x`, `y`, and `z`.
    - Perform similar tests on `wwv_t` objects as done for `wwl_t`.
    - Delete the random number generator and log the completion of tests.
    - Call `fd_halt` to terminate the program.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer `0` indicating successful execution.
