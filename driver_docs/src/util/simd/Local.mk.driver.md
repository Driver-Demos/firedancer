# Purpose
The provided content is a Makefile script used for managing the compilation and testing of software components that utilize different SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) instruction sets, specifically SSE, AVX, and AVX512. The script conditionally includes header files and defines unit tests for each instruction set, depending on whether the corresponding feature flags (`FD_HAS_SSE`, `FD_HAS_AVX`, `FD_HAS_AVX512`) are enabled. It uses custom functions like `add-hdrs`, `make-unit-test`, and `run-unit-test` to organize and execute the tests for various configurations, ensuring that the software components are correctly compiled and validated for each SIMD extension. This setup facilitates efficient testing and validation of performance optimizations across different hardware capabilities.
