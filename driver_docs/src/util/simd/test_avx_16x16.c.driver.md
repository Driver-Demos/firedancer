# Purpose
This C source code file is a test suite designed to validate the functionality of SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) operations using AVX (Advanced Vector Extensions) instructions. The code is structured to test various arithmetic, bitwise, and logical operations on vectors of short integers (`ws_t`) and unsigned short integers (`wh_t`). The file includes a main function that initializes a random number generator and iteratively tests a series of operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and bitwise shifts, on randomly generated data. The tests are performed by comparing the results of these operations against expected outcomes, which are calculated using standard C operations and macros.

The code is organized into two main sections: one for testing operations on signed short vectors (`ws_t`) and another for unsigned short vectors (`wh_t`). Each section includes tests for constructors, arithmetic operations, bit operations, and logical operations. The file uses macros to simplify repetitive tasks, such as initializing test data and expanding vector indices. The test results are verified using the `FD_TEST` macro, which likely checks the correctness of each operation. The file is intended to be executed as a standalone program, as indicated by the presence of the [`main`](#main) function, and it relies on external utilities and headers, such as `fd_util.h` and `fd_avx.h`, for additional functionality and definitions.

### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function initializes a random number generator and performs extensive testing of various arithmetic, bitwise, and logical operations on 16-element vectors of short and unsigned short integers using SIMD-like operations.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments passed to the program.
    - `argv`: An array of strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize the random number generator using `fd_rng_new` and `fd_rng_join`.
    - Define macros for generating random short and unsigned short integers within specific ranges.
    - Define macros for expanding indices to facilitate SIMD-like operations on vectors.
    - Initialize a 16-element short integer array `si` and test zero and one vector operations using [`ws_test`](test_avx_common.c.driver.md#ws_test).
    - Iterate 65536 times to perform tests on randomly generated vectors `xi` and `yi`.
    - For each iteration, initialize vectors `xi` and `yi` with random values using the `srand` macro.
    - Test various constructors and arithmetic operations (negation, absolute value, min, max, addition, subtraction, multiplication) on vectors using [`ws_test`](test_avx_common.c.driver.md#ws_test).
    - Test bitwise operations (not, shift left, shift right, rotate left, rotate right) on vectors using [`ws_test`](test_avx_common.c.driver.md#ws_test).
    - Test logical operations (equality, inequality) on vectors using [`ws_test`](test_avx_common.c.driver.md#ws_test).
    - Repeat similar tests for unsigned short vectors using [`wh_test`](test_avx_common.c.driver.md#wh_test).
    - Log a notice indicating the tests passed and halt the program.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer value of 0, indicating successful execution.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`ws_test`](test_avx_common.c.driver.md#ws_test)

### wc\_test<!-- {{#callable_declaration:wc_test}} -->
Tests the correctness of various operations on a wc_t type.
- **Description**: This function is used to verify the correctness of operations on a wc_t type, which is a vector of 8 boolean values. It checks if the packing, unpacking, extraction, insertion, and memory operations on the wc_t type produce the expected results based on the provided boolean values. This function is typically used in testing environments to ensure that the operations on wc_t are functioning as intended. It returns a non-zero value if all tests pass, and zero if any test fails.
- **Inputs**:
    - `c`: A wc_t type representing a vector of 8 boolean values. The caller must ensure that this is a valid wc_t object.
    - `c0`: An integer representing the first boolean value in the vector. It is expected to be either 0 or 1.
    - `c1`: An integer representing the second boolean value in the vector. It is expected to be either 0 or 1.
    - `c2`: An integer representing the third boolean value in the vector. It is expected to be either 0 or 1.
    - `c3`: An integer representing the fourth boolean value in the vector. It is expected to be either 0 or 1.
    - `c4`: An integer representing the fifth boolean value in the vector. It is expected to be either 0 or 1.
    - `c5`: An integer representing the sixth boolean value in the vector. It is expected to be either 0 or 1.
    - `c6`: An integer representing the seventh boolean value in the vector. It is expected to be either 0 or 1.
    - `c7`: An integer representing the eighth boolean value in the vector. It is expected to be either 0 or 1.
- **Output**: Returns 1 if all tests pass, otherwise returns 0.

### ws\_test<!-- {{#callable_declaration:ws_test}} -->
Tests if a SIMD vector matches a given array of short integers.
- **Description**: Use this function to verify that a 256-bit SIMD vector of short integers matches a specified array of 16 short integers. It checks each element of the vector against the corresponding element in the array and performs various operations to ensure the vector's integrity. This function is useful for validating SIMD operations and ensuring data consistency. It assumes that the input array has at least 16 elements and that the SIMD vector is properly initialized.
- **Inputs**:
    - `s`: A 256-bit SIMD vector of short integers to be tested. The vector should be initialized and contain 16 short integers.
    - `si`: A pointer to an array of at least 16 short integers. The array must not be null, and it provides the expected values for comparison with the SIMD vector.
- **Output**: Returns 1 if the SIMD vector matches the array of short integers; otherwise, returns 0.
- **See also**: [`ws_test`](test_avx_common.c.driver.md#ws_test)  (Implementation)

### wh\_test<!-- {{#callable_declaration:wh_test}} -->
Tests if a vector matches a given array of unsigned shorts.
- **Description**: Use this function to verify if the elements extracted from a vector match a specified array of unsigned shorts. It is useful for validating that a vector has been correctly constructed or manipulated to match expected values. The function checks each element of the vector against the corresponding element in the array and returns a result indicating whether they match. Ensure that the array contains at least 16 elements, as the function will access indices 0 through 15.
- **Inputs**:
    - `h`: A vector of type `wh_t` to be tested against the array. The caller retains ownership.
    - `hj`: A pointer to an array of at least 16 unsigned shorts. The array must not be null, and it should contain the expected values to compare against the vector.
- **Output**: Returns 1 if the vector matches the array, otherwise returns 0.
- **See also**: [`wh_test`](test_avx_common.c.driver.md#wh_test)  (Implementation)
