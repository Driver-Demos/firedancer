# Purpose
This C header file, `fd_sse.h`, provides an API for writing vectorized code using Intel's Streaming SIMD Extensions (SSE) intrinsics. It is designed to facilitate the development of high-performance applications by offering vectorized operations for various data types, such as 32-bit integers and floats, and 64-bit doubles and longs, among others. The file acts as a thin wrapper around Intel's SSE intrinsics, providing a more robust and type-safe interface that simplifies the conversion of scalar code to vectorized implementations. Additionally, it includes mechanisms to handle cross-lane data motion and transitions between scalar and vector code, making it easier to optimize code for platforms with SSE support. The API also aids in porting SSE-optimized code to non-Intel architectures by allowing developers to implement equivalent wrappers for other platforms.
