# Purpose
This C header file, `simd_test_avx512.h`, is designed to facilitate unit testing for AVX-512 SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) operations. It provides a set of macros and static assertions to ensure that the AVX-512 operations are functioning correctly. The file includes static assertions to verify that certain compile-time constants related to SIMD operations, such as width, footprint, and alignment, meet expected values. These assertions help ensure that the environment and configurations are correct for AVX-512 operations.

The file defines several macros, such as `WWI_TEST`, `WWU_TEST`, `WWL_TEST`, and `WWV_TEST`, which are used to test the correctness of SIMD operations by comparing the results of operations against expected values. These macros iterate over the lanes of SIMD vectors, checking that each lane's computed value matches the expected value, and log errors if discrepancies are found. Additionally, utility macros like `EXPAND_n` and `COMPARE_n` are provided to facilitate testing functions that require compile-time values and to compare the results of different functions. This header file is intended to be included in other C source files that perform AVX-512 unit tests, providing a consistent and reusable framework for testing SIMD operations.
