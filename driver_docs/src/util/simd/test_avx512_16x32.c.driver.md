# Purpose
The provided C source code is a comprehensive test suite for verifying the functionality of operations on wide word integer types (`wwi_t`) and wide word unsigned integer types (`wwu_t`). The code is structured as a standalone executable, as indicated by the presence of the [`main`](#main) function. It includes a series of tests that cover a wide range of operations, including construction, permutation, selection, broadcasting, arithmetic, bitwise operations, comparisons, and conversions for both signed and unsigned wide word types. The tests are executed in a loop, running a million iterations to ensure robustness and correctness of the operations.

The code utilizes a random number generator (`fd_rng_t`) to generate test data, ensuring that the tests cover a broad spectrum of possible input values. The operations tested include basic arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication), bitwise operations (AND, OR, XOR, NOT, shifts), and more complex operations like permutations, selections, and conditional operations. The code also tests conversion functions that transform wide word types into other data types. The use of macros like `WWI_TEST` and `WWU_TEST` suggests a framework for validating the results of each operation against expected outcomes. The inclusion of logging and a final notice of "pass" indicates that the tests are designed to provide clear feedback on the success of the operations being tested.

# Functions

---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function initializes a random number generator, performs extensive testing on wide word integer (wwi_t) and wide word unsigned integer (wwu_t) operations, and logs the results.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: An integer representing the number of command-line arguments.
    - `argv`: An array of strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize the program with `fd_boot` using command-line arguments.
    - Create and join a random number generator `rng`.
    - Log the start of testing for `wwi_t`.
    - Run a loop 1,000,000 times to test various operations on `wwi_t` including construction, permutation, selection, arithmetic, bitwise, and comparison operations.
    - Log the start of testing for `wwu_t`.
    - Run a loop 1,000,000 times to test various operations on `wwu_t` similar to `wwi_t`.
    - Delete the random number generator and log the completion of tests.
    - Call `fd_halt` to terminate the program.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer `0` indicating successful execution.
