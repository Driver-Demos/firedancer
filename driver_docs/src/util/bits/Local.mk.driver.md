# Purpose
The provided content is from a Makefile, which is used to automate the build process of a software project. This Makefile snippet utilizes custom functions, such as `add-hdrs`, `add-objs`, `make-unit-test`, and `run-unit-test`, to manage the compilation and testing of various components within the project. The `add-hdrs` function is used to include header files, while `add-objs` specifies object files to be compiled. The `make-unit-test` function defines unit tests for different modules, such as `test_bits`, `test_float`, and `test_hash`, associating them with the `fd_util` utility. Finally, the `run-unit-test` function executes these unit tests, ensuring that each module functions correctly. This structured approach helps maintain the integrity and reliability of the software by systematically compiling and testing its components.
