# Purpose
This C source code file is a test suite designed to validate the functionality of floating-point bit manipulation functions. It is structured as an executable program, with a [`main`](#main) function that initializes the environment using `fd_boot` and concludes with `fd_halt`. The code tests a series of functions that operate on the bit-level representation of floating-point numbers, specifically single-precision (float) and, conditionally, double-precision (double) numbers. The tests verify the correctness of functions that extract and manipulate the sign, exponent, and mantissa components of floating-point numbers, as well as functions that check for special cases like zero, infinity, and NaN (Not a Number).

The file includes comprehensive tests for both positive and negative values, including edge cases such as the smallest and largest representable numbers, and special constants like `FLT_MIN`, `FLT_MAX`, `DBL_MIN`, and `DBL_MAX`. The tests are organized using macros to ensure consistency and reduce redundancy. The code also conditionally compiles tests for double-precision numbers if the `FD_HAS_DOUBLE` macro is defined, demonstrating its adaptability to different floating-point precisions. The use of `FD_TEST` macros indicates a custom testing framework, and the final log message "pass" suggests that the tests are expected to complete without errors, confirming the reliability of the floating-point manipulation functions.

# Functions

---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function tests the correctness of floating-point bit manipulation functions for both single and double precision floating-point numbers.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments.
    - `argv`: An array of command-line argument strings.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize the environment using `fd_boot` with command-line arguments.
    - Define a macro `_` to test various floating-point bit manipulation functions for single precision floats.
    - Use the macro `_` to test specific float values and their expected bit representations and properties.
    - If `FD_HAS_DOUBLE` is defined, define a similar macro `_` for double precision floats and test specific double values.
    - Perform additional tests on special float values like zero, infinity, and NaN using [`fd_fltbits_is_zero`](fd_float.h.driver.md#fd_fltbits_is_zero), [`fd_fltbits_is_inf`](fd_float.h.driver.md#fd_fltbits_is_inf), and [`fd_fltbits_is_nan`](fd_float.h.driver.md#fd_fltbits_is_nan).
    - Iterate over a range of mantissa values to test denormalized numbers and NaN conditions for single precision floats.
    - If `FD_HAS_DOUBLE` is defined, perform similar tests for double precision floats.
    - Log a notice indicating the tests passed and halt the program with `fd_halt`.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer value `0` indicating successful execution.
