# Purpose
This C source code file is designed to test the functionality and robustness of hash functions, specifically `fd_uint_hash`, `fd_uint_hash_inverse`, `fd_ulong_hash`, and `fd_ulong_hash_inverse`. The program is structured as an executable with a [`main`](#main) function that initializes the environment using `fd_boot`, logs the start of testing, and then performs a series of tests to verify the correctness and avalanche properties of the hash functions. The tests include checking the hash values against predefined reference values for both 32-bit and 64-bit integers, ensuring that the hash and its inverse functions are consistent, and evaluating the avalanche effect, which measures how a single bit change in the input affects the output hash.

The code is comprehensive in its approach, using loops to iterate over test cases and logging results to ensure transparency in the testing process. It uses static arrays to store reference hash values and dynamically calculates the hash and its inverse to verify correctness. The avalanche tests involve generating pseudo-random numbers, hashing them, and then checking the distribution of bit changes in the output to ensure that the hash functions exhibit good diffusion properties. The program logs any discrepancies and reports the maximum fluctuation observed, ensuring that the hash functions meet the expected performance criteria. The use of logging and error checking throughout the code provides a robust framework for validating the hash functions' behavior.

# Functions

---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function tests the correctness and avalanche properties of hash functions and their inverses for both 32-bit and 64-bit integers.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments.
    - `argv`: An array of strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize the program with `fd_boot` and log the start of hash sequence testing.
    - Define reference arrays `ref32` and `ref64` for expected hash values of integers 0 to 9 for 32-bit and 64-bit hashes respectively.
    - Loop over integers 0 to 9, compute their hash and inverse hash, and compare against reference values, logging errors if mismatches occur.
    - Initialize variables for avalanche testing, including a sequence counter `seq`, iteration count `iter_cnt`, and a count array `cnt`.
    - Perform avalanche testing for `fd_uint_hash` by iterating `iter_cnt` times, computing hash differences for bit-flipped inputs, and checking the maximum fluctuation against a threshold.
    - Repeat the avalanche testing process for `fd_uint_hash_inverse`, `fd_ulong_hash`, and `fd_ulong_hash_inverse`, logging errors if fluctuations exceed the threshold.
    - Log a success message and halt the program with `fd_halt`.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer `0` indicating successful execution.
