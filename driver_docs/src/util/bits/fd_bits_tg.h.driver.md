# Purpose
The provided C code is a header file that defines a set of type-generic macros for performing bitwise and arithmetic operations. These macros are designed to handle various data types in a type-safe manner by inferring the type from the arguments, thus providing a more flexible and robust interface for bit manipulation. The file is intended for internal use and should not be included directly; it is likely included by another header file, `fd_bits.h`, which provides more context or additional functionality.

The macros in this file address several linguistic issues in C and C++ related to type promotion, particularly with smaller integer types like `char` and `short`, which are automatically promoted to `int` in expressions. This behavior can lead to unexpected results and potential security vulnerabilities. The macros ensure that operations are performed with the correct type, preventing unintended type promotions. The file includes macros for basic arithmetic operations, bitwise operations, and more complex operations like bit rotation and population count. Additionally, it provides mechanisms to select expressions based on type size, using either compiler extensions or standard C constructs, to maintain portability and efficiency. Overall, this file is a comprehensive toolkit for developers needing precise control over bit-level operations across different data types.
# Global Variables

---
### \_fd\_bits\_n
- **Type**: `int`
- **Description**: The variable `_fd_bits_n` is an integer that is used to store a value `n` at compile time, which is mostly determined during the compilation process. It is part of a macro that deals with bit manipulation operations, specifically for shifting operations.
- **Use**: This variable is used to determine the number of positions to shift bits in bit manipulation operations, particularly in the `fd_shift_left` and `fd_shift_right` macros.


---
### \_fd\_bits\_c
- **Type**: `int`
- **Description**: The variable `_fd_bits_c` is an integer that is used to determine if a shift operation should use a maximum bit index or a specified bit index. It is calculated by comparing `_fd_bits_n` and `_fd_bits_m`, which are likely related to bit manipulation operations. This variable is primarily used at compile time to optimize shift operations.
- **Use**: This variable is used to decide the shift amount in bit manipulation operations, optimizing them for compile-time evaluation.
