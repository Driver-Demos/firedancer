# Purpose
This file is a Makefile snippet used in a build system to manage dependencies for a software project. It utilizes a macro or function call syntax to add header files (`fd_valloc.h`) and object files (`fd_valloc`, `fd_util`) to the build process, ensuring they are included in the compilation and linking stages.
