# Purpose
The file is a Makefile script used for building and testing components in a software project. It defines build rules by adding headers and object files, specifically `fd_env.h` and `fd_env` with `fd_util`, and sets up a unit test named `test_env` that depends on `fd_util`. It also includes a command to execute the `test_env` unit test.
