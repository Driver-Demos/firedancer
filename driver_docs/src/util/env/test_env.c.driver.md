# Purpose
This C source code file is a test program designed to validate the functionality of a set of command-line argument processing functions, likely part of a larger library or framework. The program includes a main function that initializes a simulated command-line argument list and then systematically tests various functions that strip specific types of arguments from this list. These functions, such as `fd_env_strip_cmdline_cstr`, `fd_env_strip_cmdline_char`, and others, are used to extract and remove arguments of different data types (e.g., strings, characters, integers, floats) from the command-line arguments array. The tests ensure that the functions correctly handle normal cases, default values, and edge cases, including scenarios where the arguments are not present.

The code is structured to perform a series of assertions using `FD_TEST` to verify that the expected outcomes match the actual results after each function call. This includes checking that the remaining arguments in the list are as expected and that the extracted values are correct. The program also tests the presence of specific command-line options using `fd_env_strip_cmdline_contains`. The inclusion of conditional compilation for double precision floating-point support (`FD_HAS_DOUBLE`) suggests that the code is designed to be portable across different environments. The file concludes with logging a success message and halting the program, indicating that all tests have passed. This file is primarily intended for internal testing and validation purposes rather than providing a public API or external interface.

# Functions

---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function initializes command-line arguments, tests various command-line stripping functions, and validates their behavior through assertions.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments passed to the program.
    - `argv`: An array of strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize the environment using `fd_boot` with `argc` and `argv`.
    - Define a buffer `buf` and an array `_my_argv` to store command-line arguments.
    - Populate `my_argv` with predefined command-line arguments using a macro to copy strings into `buf`.
    - Set the last element of `my_argv` to `NULL` to mark the end of arguments.
    - Perform a series of tests using `fd_env_strip_cmdline_*` functions to strip and validate command-line arguments of various types (e.g., `cstr`, `char`, `int`).
    - Use `FD_TEST` macros to assert the expected outcomes of the stripping functions, ensuring the arguments are correctly processed and stripped.
    - Test edge cases by decrementing `my_argc` and validating the behavior of stripping functions with reduced arguments.
    - Perform additional tests to check the presence of specific command-line options using `fd_env_strip_cmdline_contains`.
    - Log a notice indicating the tests passed and call `fd_halt` to terminate the program.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer `0` indicating successful execution.
