# Purpose
This is a Makefile snippet used for building a software project. It defines build rules and dependencies by adding header files and object files, and conditionally appends preprocessor flags and additional object files if the `FD_HAS_DEEPASAN_WATCH` variable is set. The `add-hdrs`, `make-lib`, and `add-objs` functions are invoked to manage these build components.
