# Purpose
This C source code file defines a function [`fd_backtrace_print`](#fd_backtrace_print) that captures and prints a backtrace of the current call stack to a specified file descriptor. It includes the necessary header `execinfo.h` to utilize the `backtrace` and `backtrace_symbols_fd` functions, which are part of the GNU C Library. The function allocates an array `bt` to store up to 1024 stack frames, captures the backtrace into this array, and then writes the symbolic representation of the backtrace to the file descriptor `fd`. This code is typically used for debugging purposes, allowing developers to trace the sequence of function calls leading to a particular point in the program.

### fd\_backtrace\_print<!-- {{#callable:fd_backtrace_print}} -->
The `fd_backtrace_print` function captures the current call stack and writes the backtrace symbols to a specified file descriptor.
- **Inputs**:
    - `fd`: An integer representing the file descriptor to which the backtrace symbols will be written.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Declare an array `bt` of 1024 void pointers to store the backtrace addresses.
    - Call the `backtrace` function to fill the `bt` array with the current call stack addresses, storing the number of addresses in `bt_size`.
    - Use `backtrace_symbols_fd` to convert the addresses in `bt` to human-readable strings and write them to the file descriptor `fd`.
- **Output**: This function does not return a value; it writes the backtrace information directly to the specified file descriptor.
