# Purpose
This C source code file defines a static function [`do_not_call_me`](#do_not_call_me) that serves as a "canary" for a fuzz testing framework, as indicated by the inclusion of the "fd_fuzz.h" header. The function contains a macro `FD_FUZZ_MUST_BE_COVERED`, which likely acts as a marker or trigger for the fuzz testing tool to ensure that this code path is executed during testing. The purpose of this file is not to perform any functional operations but to verify the effectiveness of the fuzz testing process by ensuring that the canary is detected. If the fuzz testing script fails to identify this canary, it is considered a failure, highlighting potential gaps in the test coverage.

### do\_not\_call\_me<!-- {{#callable:do_not_call_me}} -->
The `do_not_call_me` function is a static function that serves as a canary to ensure that a specific code path is covered by the fuzz testing framework.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function is defined as static, meaning it is limited to the file scope and cannot be called from other files.
    - The function contains a single macro `FD_FUZZ_MUST_BE_COVERED`, which is likely used to mark this function as a required coverage point for fuzz testing.
- **Output**: The function does not return any value as it is a `void` function.
