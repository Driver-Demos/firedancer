# Purpose
This code is a simple C header file that declares a function prototype for [`fd_backtrace_print`](#fd_backtrace_print). The function is intended to print a backtrace to a specified file descriptor, which is useful for debugging purposes by providing a stack trace of function calls leading to a certain point in the program. The header guards, defined by `#ifndef`, `#define`, and `#endif`, prevent multiple inclusions of this header file, which could otherwise lead to compilation errors. This file is likely part of a larger utility library focused on error handling or debugging support.
# Function Declarations (Public API)

---
### fd\_backtrace\_print<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_backtrace_print}} -->
Prints a backtrace to the specified file descriptor.
- **Description**: Use this function to output a backtrace of the current call stack to a given file descriptor, which is useful for debugging purposes. It captures the current execution state and writes the backtrace information directly to the specified file descriptor. This function should be called when a backtrace is needed, such as during error handling or debugging sessions. Ensure that the file descriptor is valid and open for writing to avoid undefined behavior.
- **Inputs**:
    - `fd`: An integer representing the file descriptor to which the backtrace will be printed. It must be a valid, open file descriptor capable of writing. If the file descriptor is invalid or closed, the behavior is undefined.
- **Output**: None
- **See also**: [`fd_backtrace_print`](fd_backtrace.c.driver.md#fd_backtrace_print)  (Implementation)
