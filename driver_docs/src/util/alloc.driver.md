## Files
- **[fd_alloc.c](alloc/fd_alloc.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_alloc.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase implements a memory allocation system with support for size classes, atomic operations, and superblock management, providing functions for memory allocation, deallocation, and diagnostics.
- **[fd_alloc.h](alloc/fd_alloc.h.driver.md)**: The `fd_alloc.h` file in the `firedancer` codebase provides a high-performance, lock-free allocator optimized for concurrency and small allocation sizes, with features for efficient memory management and dynamic resizing.
- **[fd_alloc_cfg.h](alloc/fd_alloc_cfg.h.driver.md)**: The `fd_alloc_cfg.h` file in the `firedancer` codebase defines the configuration for memory allocation size classes, detailing the structure and parameters for managing superblocks and their subdivisions to optimize allocation efficiency.
- **[fd_alloc_ctl.c](alloc/fd_alloc_ctl.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_alloc_ctl.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase implements a command-line utility for managing memory allocation workspaces, supporting operations such as creating, deleting, allocating, freeing, compacting, and querying memory allocations.
- **[fd_alloc_ctl_help](alloc/fd_alloc_ctl_help.driver.md)**: The `fd_alloc_ctl_help` file provides a command-line interface for managing workspace allocations, including commands for setting tags, creating and deleting allocators, performing memory allocations and deallocations, compacting memory, and querying allocator status.
- **[Local.mk](alloc/Local.mk.driver.md)**: The `Local.mk` file in the `firedancer` codebase specifies build instructions for the `fd_alloc` and `fd_util` components, including object files, headers, binaries, unit tests, and test scripts.
- **[test_alloc.c](alloc/test_alloc.c.driver.md)**: The `test_alloc.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase implements a comprehensive unit test for memory allocation functions, including torture tests for same-thread and inter-thread memory allocation and deallocation scenarios.
- **[test_alloc_ctl](alloc/test_alloc_ctl.driver.md)**: The `test_alloc_ctl` file is a Bash script that tests various functionalities of the `fd_alloc_ctl` and `fd_wksp_ctl` commands in the `firedancer` codebase, including workspace creation, allocation, querying, freeing, compacting, and deletion.
