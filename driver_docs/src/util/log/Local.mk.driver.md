# Purpose
The file is a Makefile snippet used in a build system to manage dependencies and compile targets. It adds the header file `fd_log.h` to the build process, includes object files `fd_log` and `fd_util` for compilation, and defines a unit test target `test_log` that depends on `test_log` and `fd_util`.
