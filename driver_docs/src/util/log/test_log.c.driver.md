# Purpose
This C source code file is a comprehensive test suite for a logging system, designed to validate various logging functionalities and configurations. The code is structured as an executable program, with a [`main`](#main) function that orchestrates a series of tests to ensure the logging system behaves as expected under different scenarios. It includes static assertions to verify compile-time constants related to logging, such as maximum log name length and buffer sizes, ensuring that these values are consistent with the expected configuration.

The file tests a wide range of logging features, including different log levels (DEBUG, INFO, NOTICE, WARNING, CRIT, ALERT, EMERG), colorization settings, and thread-specific logging information. It also exercises the logging system's ability to handle hexdump logging, which involves logging memory contents in a hexadecimal format, and tests edge cases such as logging with null or empty descriptions, large data blobs, and unprintable characters. Additionally, the code verifies the functionality of wallclock timing and sleep functions, which are crucial for time-sensitive logging operations. The file concludes with tests for setting and verifying thread and CPU names, as well as ensuring that the logging system can handle duplicate log entries and flush operations correctly. Overall, this file serves as a robust validation tool for developers to ensure the reliability and correctness of the logging system in various operational contexts.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `../fd_util.h`


# Global Variables

---
### volatile\_yes
- **Type**: `int volatile`
- **Description**: The `volatile_yes` variable is a global integer variable declared with the `volatile` keyword and initialized to 1. The `volatile` keyword indicates that the value of this variable may change at any time without any action being taken by the code the compiler finds nearby.
- **Use**: It is used to control the execution of certain logging and testing functions, ensuring they are executed based on its value.


---
### large\_blob
- **Type**: `char`
- **Description**: The `large_blob` is a static character array with a size of 50,000 elements. It is initialized to be filled with the character 'b' (0x62 in hexadecimal) using the `memset` function.
- **Use**: This variable is used to test the logging system's ability to handle and log very large data blobs.


# Functions

---
### backtrace\_test<!-- {{#callable:backtrace_test}} -->
The `backtrace_test` function logs critical, alert, and emergency messages, each triggering a backtrace and program abort if a volatile condition is true.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function checks if the global variable `volatile_yes` is true.
    - If true, it logs a critical message using `FD_LOG_CRIT`, which includes a warning, backtrace, and aborts the program.
    - It then checks `volatile_yes` again and logs an alert message using `FD_LOG_ALERT`, which also includes a warning, backtrace, and aborts the program.
    - Finally, it checks `volatile_yes` once more and logs an emergency message using `FD_LOG_EMERG`, which similarly includes a warning, backtrace, and aborts the program.
- **Output**: The function does not return any value as it is a void function, but it may terminate the program execution through logging functions that include abort operations.


---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function initializes logging, tests various logging functionalities, and performs rudimentary wallclock tests before terminating the program.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments passed to the program.
    - `argv`: An array of strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize the logging system with `fd_boot` using `argc` and `argv`.
    - Log various non-cancelling messages at different log levels (DEBUG, INFO, NOTICE, WARNING).
    - Retrieve and log information about the current thread and logging configuration.
    - Verify and log build information if available.
    - Test and log the colorization settings, temporarily disabling and re-enabling it if active.
    - Perform tests on group ID queries to ensure they return expected values.
    - Log a notice about testing the hexdump logging API and exercise edge cases with different permutations of log levels, descriptions, memory pointers, and sizes.
    - Test logging with small, large, and mixed character blobs, including unprintable characters.
    - Test and adjust log levels for logfile, stderr, flush, and core, ensuring they can be set and reset correctly.
    - Set and verify thread and CPU names using `fd_log_thread_set` and `fd_log_cpu_set`.
    - Conduct rudimentary wallclock tests to measure overhead and test sleep and wait functions.
    - Log a test message using a predefined hex array for debugging purposes.
    - Perform a large number of duplicate log notices if `volatile_yes` is true.
    - Flush the log buffer with `fd_log_flush`.
    - Perform tests to ensure `FD_TEST` does not misinterpret format strings, avoiding certain tests if compiled with Clang.
    - Log a cancelling error message and call [`backtrace_test`](#backtrace_test) if `volatile_yes` is false.
    - Log a final notice indicating the test passed and call `fd_halt` to terminate the program.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer value of 0, indicating successful execution.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`backtrace_test`](#backtrace_test)
