# Purpose
This file is a Makefile snippet used for managing the build process of a software project. It defines the inclusion of header files and object files, specifies unit tests to be created, and outlines the execution of these unit tests. The use of `$(call ...)` indicates the invocation of predefined Makefile functions to streamline these tasks.
