# Purpose
The file is a Makefile snippet used for building and testing components in a software project. It defines the inclusion of header files (`fd_rng.h`), specifies object files (`fd_rng`, `fd_rng_secure`, `fd_util`) to be compiled, and sets up a unit test named `test_rng` using the `fd_util` library. It also includes a command to execute the `test_rng` unit test.
