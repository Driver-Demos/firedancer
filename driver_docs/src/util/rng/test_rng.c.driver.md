# Purpose
This C source code file is a comprehensive test suite for a random number generator (RNG) library. It is designed to validate various functionalities of the RNG, including alignment and footprint checks, sequence and index management, and the generation of random numbers across different data types and domains. The code includes static assertions to ensure that the alignment and footprint of the RNG structure match expected values, and it performs a series of tests to verify the correct operation of RNG functions such as `fd_rng_new`, `fd_rng_join`, `fd_rng_seq`, and `fd_rng_idx`. Additionally, the code tests the conversion of random unsigned integers to floating-point numbers with different constraints (e.g., closed, open intervals) and evaluates the statistical properties of the generated numbers, such as their popcount distribution.

The file is structured as an executable C program, with a [`main`](#main) function that orchestrates the testing process. It includes detailed logging to provide insights into the test results and potential failures. The code also contains platform-specific tests for secure random number generation, which are conditionally compiled for Linux, FreeBSD, and macOS systems. The test suite is thorough, covering a wide range of RNG functionalities, and it ensures that the RNG library behaves as expected under various conditions. This file does not define public APIs or external interfaces but rather serves as an internal validation tool for the RNG library's implementation.

# Functions

---
### log\_ref<!-- {{#callable:log_ref}} -->
The `log_ref` function logs a formatted representation of a 10-element array of unsigned long integers, along with a sequence and index identifier, to the notice log.
- **Inputs**:
    - `ref`: A pointer to an array of 10 unsigned long integers that will be logged.
    - `seq`: An unsigned integer representing the sequence number, used in the log message.
    - `idx`: An unsigned long integer representing the index, used in the log message.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function begins by logging the start of an array declaration with the sequence and index identifiers.
    - It enters a loop that iterates over the 10 elements of the `ref` array.
    - For each element, it logs the element in hexadecimal format, appending a comma if it is not the last element.
    - After the loop, it logs the closing brace of the array declaration.
- **Output**: The function does not return any value; it outputs log messages to the notice log.


---
### test\_rng\_secure<!-- {{#callable:test_rng_secure}} -->
The `test_rng_secure` function tests the `fd_rng_secure` function by generating random data, calculating popcount statistics, and logging the results.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize variables for sum of popcounts, sum of squared popcounts, minimum popcount, and maximum popcount.
    - Declare a buffer of 4096 bytes and fill it with random data using `fd_rng_secure`.
    - Iterate over the buffer in 8-byte chunks, calculate the popcount for each chunk, and update the sum, sum of squares, minimum, and maximum popcount values.
    - Calculate the average and root mean square (RMS) of the popcounts.
    - Log the calculated statistics using `FD_LOG_NOTICE`.
- **Output**: The function does not return any value; it logs the popcount statistics of the random data generated.


---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function initializes and tests a random number generator (RNG) by verifying its alignment, footprint, sequence, index, and various number generation capabilities, while also performing statistical analysis on generated numbers.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments passed to the program.
    - `argv`: An array of strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize the environment with `fd_boot` using `argc` and `argv`.
    - Log a notice about testing alignment and footprint, then verify the RNG alignment and footprint using `FD_TEST`.
    - Log a notice about testing RNG creation, create a new RNG with `fd_rng_new`, and verify its success.
    - Log a notice about testing RNG joining, join the RNG with `fd_rng_join`, and verify its success.
    - Log a notice about testing sequence and index, verify initial sequence and index values, and compare generated numbers with expected values.
    - Set a new sequence, generate numbers, and compare them with another set of expected values.
    - Verify sequence and index after setting them to new values, and test number generation consistency.
    - Log a notice about testing generator domains, perform various tests on number generation functions, and verify their outputs.
    - Perform a loop to generate numbers of different types, verify their properties, and update a domain mask based on the results.
    - Log a notice about testing seed expansion, perform a loop to expand seeds, and calculate statistical properties of the results.
    - Log a notice about testing RNG leave and delete operations, and verify their success.
    - If on a supported platform, call [`test_rng_secure`](#test_rng_secure) to test secure RNG functionality.
    - Log a final notice indicating the tests passed and call `fd_halt` to terminate the program.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer value of 0, indicating successful execution.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`log_ref`](#log_ref)
    - [`test_rng_secure`](#test_rng_secure)
