# Purpose
This C header file, generated by a script named `generate_filters.py`, defines a seccomp (secure computing mode) filter policy for a sandbox environment. The file is not intended to be edited manually, as indicated by the comment at the top. It includes several Linux kernel headers related to auditing, capabilities, filtering, and seccomp, which are essential for defining and applying seccomp filters. The primary function, [`populate_sock_filter_policy_test_sandbox`](#populate_sock_filter_policy_test_sandbox), populates a `sock_filter` array with a predefined set of instructions that enforce a security policy by allowing or denying specific system calls based on the architecture and syscall number. This policy is implemented using the Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF) syntax, which is a low-level language used for packet filtering and other kernel-level operations.

The file is designed to be included in other C source files, as indicated by the header guards and the inclusion of other headers. It defines a static function and a constant, which suggests that its functionality is intended to be used internally within a larger codebase rather than providing a public API. The seccomp filter policy defined here is relatively narrow in scope, focusing on a small set of system calls (`write`, `fsync`, and `exit_group`) and enforcing a strict policy that kills the process if an unauthorized syscall is attempted. This approach enhances security by limiting the actions that a process can perform, thereby reducing the risk of exploitation.

# Global Variables

---
### sock\_filter\_policy\_test\_sandbox\_instr\_cnt
- **Type**: `unsigned int`
- **Description**: The variable `sock_filter_policy_test_sandbox_instr_cnt` is a constant unsigned integer that holds the value 15. It represents the number of instructions in a specific seccomp filter policy used for sandboxing.
- **Use**: This variable is used to ensure that the output buffer in the `populate_sock_filter_policy_test_sandbox` function has enough space to hold the 15 instructions of the seccomp filter.


# Functions

---
### populate\_sock\_filter\_policy\_test\_sandbox<!-- {{#callable:populate_sock_filter_policy_test_sandbox}} -->
The function `populate_sock_filter_policy_test_sandbox` initializes a seccomp BPF filter array to enforce a security policy for system calls, and copies it to the provided output buffer.
- **Inputs**:
    - `out_cnt`: The number of elements in the output buffer, which must be at least 15.
    - `out`: A pointer to a buffer where the seccomp BPF filter array will be copied.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function begins by asserting that `out_cnt` is at least 15 using `FD_TEST` to ensure the output buffer is large enough.
    - A static array `filter` of 15 `sock_filter` structures is defined to represent the seccomp BPF filter.
    - The filter checks if the architecture of the script matches the runtime architecture, jumping to `RET_KILL_PROCESS` if not.
    - It loads the syscall number and checks if it matches `SYS_write`, `SYS_fsync`, or `SYS_exit_group`, allowing them if they match specific conditions.
    - If none of the syscalls match, it jumps to `RET_KILL_PROCESS`.
    - For `SYS_write`, it checks the first argument and allows it if it matches specific values, otherwise it jumps to `RET_KILL_PROCESS`.
    - For `SYS_fsync`, it checks the first argument and allows it if it matches a specific value, otherwise it jumps to `RET_KILL_PROCESS`.
    - The `RET_KILL_PROCESS` case is a fallthrough that terminates the process, while `RET_ALLOW` allows the syscall to proceed.
    - Finally, the function copies the `filter` array to the `out` buffer using `fd_memcpy`.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it populates the `out` buffer with the seccomp BPF filter array.
