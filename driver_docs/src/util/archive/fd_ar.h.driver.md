# Purpose
This C header file, `fd_ar.h`, provides an interface for reading AR archive files, a simple archive format similar to TAR, which combines multiple files into a single archive. The file defines the structure and functions necessary to initialize and read through an AR archive in a streaming manner. The primary components include the `fd_ar_meta` structure, which holds metadata about each file in the archive, such as modification time, user ID, group ID, file mode, file size, and an identifier. The file also declares two key functions: [`fd_ar_read_init`](#fd_ar_read_init), which initializes the reading process by positioning the stream at the start of the archive, and [`fd_ar_read_next`](#fd_ar_read_next), which reads the next file's metadata and positions the stream at the start of the file's content.

The header file is designed to be included in other C source files, providing a public API for handling AR archives. It specifies error codes for handling various failure scenarios, such as invalid streams, end-of-file conditions, I/O failures, and malformed archive files. The file is part of a larger library, as indicated by the inclusion of `fd_util_base.h`, and it is intended to be used in both hosted environments (where the stream is a `FILE *` pointer) and other target environments. The documentation within the file provides detailed usage instructions and error handling guidelines, making it a comprehensive resource for developers working with AR archives in C.

# Data Structures

---
### fd\_ar\_meta
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `mtime`: Stores the modification time of the file.
    - `uid`: Stores the user ID of the file owner.
    - `gid`: Stores the group ID of the file owner.
    - `mode`: Stores the file mode (permissions).
    - `filesz`: Stores the size of the file, guaranteed to be non-negative.
    - `ident`: Stores the file identifier, guaranteed to be null-terminated.
- **Description**: The `fd_ar_meta` structure is used to store metadata for files within an AR archive, a simple archive format similar to TAR. It includes fields for the file's modification time, user and group IDs, file mode, and size, as well as a null-terminated identifier string. This structure is essential for reading and processing files within an AR archive, providing necessary metadata for each file entry.

### fd\_ar\_meta\_t
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `mtime`: Stores the modification time of the file as a long integer.
    - `uid`: Stores the user ID of the file owner as a long integer.
    - `gid`: Stores the group ID of the file owner as a long integer.
    - `mode`: Stores the file mode (permissions) as a long integer.
    - `filesz`: Stores the size of the file content in bytes as a long integer, guaranteed to be non-negative.
    - `ident`: Stores the file identifier as a null-terminated string with a maximum size of 17 bytes.
- **Description**: The `fd_ar_meta_t` structure is used to store metadata for files within an AR archive, including modification time, user and group IDs, file mode, file size, and a null-terminated identifier string. This metadata is essential for processing and managing files within the archive, allowing for operations such as reading and extracting file contents based on their metadata attributes.
