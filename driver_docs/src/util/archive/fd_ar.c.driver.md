# Purpose
This C source code file provides functionality for reading and interpreting archive files, specifically in the "ar" format, which is a common archive format used in Unix-like systems. The code is designed to be used in a hosted environment, as indicated by the `#if FD_HAS_HOSTED` preprocessor directive. The primary focus of the code is to define the structure of an archive file header (`fd_ar_hdr_t`) and to provide functions for initializing and reading entries from an archive file stream. The `fd_ar_hdr_t` structure captures metadata about each file entry in the archive, such as the file identifier, modification time, user and group IDs, file mode, and file size, all of which are stored as ASCII strings and require conversion to numerical values for processing.

The file includes functions like [`fd_ar_read_init`](#fd_ar_read_init) and [`fd_ar_read_next`](#fd_ar_read_next), which are responsible for initializing the reading process and iterating over the entries in the archive, respectively. The [`fd_ar_ascii_to_long`](#fd_ar_ascii_to_long) function is a utility that converts ASCII-encoded fields to long integers, handling potential errors in the conversion process. The code ensures that the archive's magic number is verified to confirm the file format and checks for proper alignment and validity of the header fields. This file is not intended to be an executable on its own but rather a component of a larger system that processes archive files, providing a narrow but essential functionality for handling the "ar" file format.

# Data Structures

### fd\_ar\_hdr
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `ident`: File identifier, WARNING: may not be '\0' terminated.
    - `mtime_dec`: File modification timestamp (ASCII decimal), WARNING: may not be '\0' terminated.
    - `uid_dec`: Owner ID (ASCII decimal), WARNING: may not be '\0' terminated.
    - `gid_dec`: Group ID (ASCII decimal), WARNING: may not be '\0' terminated.
    - `mode_oct`: File mode (ASCII octal), WARNING: may not be '\0' terminated.
    - `filesz_dec`: File size (ASCII decimal), WARNING: may not be '\0' terminated.
    - `magic`: A magic number that should equal FD_AR_HDR_MAGIC.
- **Description**: The `fd_ar_hdr` structure represents the raw header of a file entry in an archive file, containing metadata such as file identifier, modification timestamp, owner and group IDs, file mode, and file size, all stored as character arrays with potential non-null termination. The structure also includes a magic number to verify the integrity of the header. This structure is used to parse and interpret the header information of files within an archive, with fields encoded in ASCII and requiring conversion to numerical values for further processing.

### fd\_ar\_hdr\_t
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `ident`: File identifier, may not be '\0' terminated.
    - `mtime_dec`: File modification timestamp in ASCII decimal, may not be '\0' terminated.
    - `uid_dec`: Owner ID in ASCII decimal, may not be '\0' terminated.
    - `gid_dec`: Group ID in ASCII decimal, may not be '\0' terminated.
    - `mode_oct`: File mode in ASCII octal, may not be '\0' terminated.
    - `filesz_dec`: File size in ASCII decimal, may not be '\0' terminated.
    - `magic`: Magic number indicating the header type, must be equal to FD_AR_HDR_MAGIC.
- **Description**: The `fd_ar_hdr_t` structure represents the raw header of a file entry in an archive file, commonly known as an 'ar' file. It contains fields for the file identifier, modification timestamp, owner and group IDs, file mode, and file size, all stored as ASCII strings that may not be null-terminated. The structure also includes a magic number to verify the header type. The fields are designed to be converted to long integers for processing, with specific handling for ASCII encoding and potential variations in the 'ar' file format. This structure is crucial for reading and interpreting the metadata of files within an archive.


# Functions

---
### fd\_ar\_ascii\_to\_long<!-- {{#callable:fd_ar_ascii_to_long}} -->
The `fd_ar_ascii_to_long` function converts a string representation of a number into a long integer, handling potential errors in the conversion process.
- **Inputs**:
    - `field`: A pointer to a character array representing the ASCII string to be converted.
    - `width`: The number of characters in the field to be considered for conversion, which should be less than 32.
    - `base`: The numerical base to be used for conversion, which should be a supported base for `strtol`.
    - `_val`: A pointer to a long where the converted value will be stored.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if the width is 32 or more, returning EINVAL if true.
    - Copy the specified width of characters from the field into a local buffer and null-terminate it.
    - Initialize errno to 0 and use `strtol` to attempt conversion of the string to a long integer.
    - Check if `strtol` set errno, returning the error code if true.
    - Check if the conversion did not advance the end pointer, indicating an invalid input, and return EINVAL if true.
    - Store the converted value in the location pointed to by `_val`.
    - Return 0 to indicate successful conversion.
- **Output**: Returns 0 on successful conversion, or an error code (such as EINVAL or errno) if the conversion fails.


---
### fd\_ar\_read\_init<!-- {{#callable:fd_ar_read_init}} -->
The `fd_ar_read_init` function initializes reading from an archive file stream by verifying the archive header magic number.
- **Inputs**:
    - `_stream`: A pointer to a file stream (void pointer) that is expected to be cast to a FILE pointer for reading the archive.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Cast the input `_stream` to a `FILE` pointer named `stream`.
    - Check if the `stream` is NULL and return `EINVAL` if true.
    - Read 8 bytes from the `stream` into a `magic` buffer to check the archive header magic.
    - If reading fails, return `ENOENT` if end-of-file is reached, otherwise return `EIO`.
    - Compare the `magic` buffer with the expected archive magic string `!<arch>\n`.
    - If the magic does not match, return `EPROTO`.
    - If all checks pass, return 0 indicating successful initialization.
- **Output**: Returns 0 on successful initialization, or an error code (`EINVAL`, `ENOENT`, `EIO`, `EPROTO`) if initialization fails.


---
### fd\_ar\_read\_next<!-- {{#callable:fd_ar_read_next}} -->
The `fd_ar_read_next` function is a placeholder that performs no operations and always returns 1 when the code is compiled for a non-hosted environment.
- **Inputs**:
    - `stream`: A pointer to a stream, which is not used in this function.
    - `meta`: A pointer to an `fd_ar_meta_t` structure, which is not used in this function.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function takes two arguments, `stream` and `meta`, but does not use them, as indicated by the casting to void.
    - A memory fence operation `FD_COMPILER_MFENCE()` is executed, which is typically used to prevent certain types of compiler optimizations that could reorder memory operations.
    - The function returns the integer value 1, indicating a default or placeholder behavior.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer value of 1, serving as a placeholder return value.
