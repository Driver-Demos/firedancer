# Purpose
This C source code file is designed to test the functionality of handling TAR file headers, specifically focusing on verifying the correct interpretation of file sizes encoded within a TAR header. The file includes two header files, `fd_util.h` and `fd_tar.h`, which likely provide utility functions and TAR-specific operations, respectively. The core of the file is a test case that initializes a constant array `test_large_header` representing a 512-byte TAR header. This header is used to test the function `fd_tar_meta_get_size`, which extracts and returns the file size from the TAR header. The test checks if the extracted size matches the expected value of `10771643384UL`, indicating that the function correctly interprets large file sizes.

The file is structured as an executable C program with a [`main`](#main) function, which suggests it is intended to be run as a standalone test rather than being part of a library or a header file. The program uses functions like `fd_boot` and `fd_halt` to manage initialization and cleanup, which are likely defined in the included utility headers. The use of `FD_TEST` and `FD_LOG_NOTICE` indicates a testing framework or logging mechanism is in place to report the success of the test. Overall, this file serves a narrow purpose: to validate the correct handling of large file sizes in TAR headers, ensuring that the associated functions can accurately process and interpret TAR metadata.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `../fd_util.h`
- `fd_tar.h`


# Global Variables

---
### test\_large\_header
- **Type**: `uchar const[512]`
- **Description**: The `test_large_header` is a global constant array of unsigned characters with a fixed size of 512 bytes. It appears to represent a header, possibly for a TAR file, as suggested by the inclusion of the `fd_tar.h` header file and the use of `fd_tar_meta_t` in the code. The array is initialized with a sequence of hexadecimal values, some of which correspond to ASCII characters, while others are null bytes or other binary data.
- **Use**: This variable is used to store a predefined header that is likely utilized in testing or validating TAR file metadata operations.


# Functions

---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function initializes the environment, tests the size of a tar header, logs a success message, and then halts the program.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The count of command-line arguments passed to the program.
    - `argv`: An array of strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Call `fd_boot` to initialize the environment with command-line arguments.
    - Cast `test_large_header` to a `fd_tar_meta_t` pointer using `fd_type_pun_const`.
    - Check if the size of the tar header obtained from [`fd_tar_meta_get_size`](fd_tar_reader.c.driver.md#fd_tar_meta_get_size) equals 10771643384UL using `FD_TEST`.
    - Log a notice message 'pass' using `FD_LOG_NOTICE`.
    - Call `fd_halt` to terminate the program.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer value of 0, indicating successful execution.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`fd_tar_meta_get_size`](fd_tar_reader.c.driver.md#fd_tar_meta_get_size)
