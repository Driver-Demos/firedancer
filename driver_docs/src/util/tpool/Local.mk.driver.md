# Purpose
The file is a Makefile snippet used for build automation. It defines build rules by invoking macros to add header files (`fd_tpool.h`) and object files (`fd_tpool`, `fd_util`) to the build process. Additionally, it specifies a unit test target (`test_tpool`) that depends on the `fd_util` component.
