## Folders
- **[generated](sandbox/generated.driver.md)**: The `generated` folder in the `firedancer` codebase contains a single generated header file, `test_sandbox_seccomp.h`, which defines a seccomp filter policy for sandboxing by specifying allowed system calls.

## Files
- **[fd_sandbox.c](sandbox/fd_sandbox.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_sandbox.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase implements various functions for managing and enforcing sandboxing mechanisms on Linux systems, including user namespace management, file descriptor checks, environment variable clearing, and resource limit settings.
- **[fd_sandbox.h](sandbox/fd_sandbox.h.driver.md)**: The `fd_sandbox.h` file in the `firedancer` codebase provides functions for establishing a secure sandbox environment on Linux systems, including checking for necessary capabilities, entering the sandbox, switching user and group IDs, and retrieving process and thread IDs in the root PID namespace.
- **[fd_sandbox_private.h](sandbox/fd_sandbox_private.h.driver.md)**: The `fd_sandbox_private.h` file in the `firedancer` codebase provides private function prototypes for managing and securing sandbox environments, including clearing environment variables, checking file descriptors, switching user and group IDs, writing user namespace mappings, denying namespace creation, pivoting root directories, setting resource limits, reading kernel capabilities, dropping capabilities, applying landlock restrictions, setting seccomp filters, and entering sandboxes without seccomp.
- **[Local.mk](sandbox/Local.mk.driver.md)**: The `Local.mk` file in the `firedancer` codebase is a makefile that conditionally adds headers, objects, and unit tests for the sandbox utility based on the presence of hosted, Linux, and architecture support.
- **[test_sandbox.c](sandbox/test_sandbox.c.driver.md)**: The `test_sandbox.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase contains a series of tests for sandboxing functionalities, including environment clearing, file descriptor checks, namespace denial, UID/GID switching, capability dropping, resource limits, and seccomp filtering.
- **[test_sandbox.seccomppolicy](sandbox/test_sandbox.seccomppolicy.driver.md)**: The `test_sandbox.seccomppolicy` file defines a seccomp policy for the `firedancer` project, specifying allowed system calls and their conditions, such as `write` and `fsync` with specific argument checks, and `exit_group`.
