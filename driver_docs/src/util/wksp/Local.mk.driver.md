# Purpose
The provided content is from a Makefile, which is a build automation tool used to manage the build process of software projects. This specific Makefile snippet is responsible for organizing the compilation and testing of various components related to a workspace module, indicated by the prefix `fd_wksp`. It uses custom macros like `add-hdrs`, `add-objs`, `make-bin`, `make-unit-test`, and `run-unit-test` to add headers, compile object files, create binaries, and define and execute unit tests, respectively. The conditional block `ifdef FD_HAS_HOSTED` ensures that certain tests are only executed if the `FD_HAS_HOSTED` flag is set, indicating that the tests require specific API support available on hosted targets. The commented line suggests a known issue or pending task related to enabling a particular unit test.
