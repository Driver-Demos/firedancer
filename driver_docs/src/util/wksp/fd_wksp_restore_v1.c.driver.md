# Purpose
The provided C code is a part of a private workspace restoration utility, specifically designed to handle the restoration of data from a checkpoint file into a workspace. This code is not intended to be a standalone executable but rather a component of a larger system, likely a library or a module that deals with workspace management. The primary functionality of this code is to read and restore data structures from a serialized format stored in a file, ensuring that the workspace is correctly reconstructed with all its partitions and metadata intact. The code includes functions to restore unsigned long integers and variable-length buffers from a buffered input stream, which are essential for reconstructing the workspace's state.

The code defines several static functions and macros to facilitate the restoration process, such as [`fd_wksp_private_restore_v1_ulong`](#fd_wksp_private_restore_v1_ulong) and [`fd_wksp_private_restore_v1_buf`](#fd_wksp_private_restore_v1_buf), which handle the deserialization of data from the input stream. The main function, [`fd_wksp_private_restore_v1`](#fd_wksp_private_restore_v1), orchestrates the entire restoration process, including opening the checkpoint file, reading and validating metadata, restoring allocations, and rebuilding the workspace. Additionally, the code includes a function [`fd_wksp_private_printf_v1`](#fd_wksp_private_printf_v1) for printing detailed information about the restored workspace, which can be used for debugging or logging purposes. The use of macros like `RESTORE_ULONG` and `RESTORE_CSTR` helps streamline the restoration of various data types, ensuring consistency and error handling throughout the process. Overall, this code is a specialized utility for managing workspace state restoration, with a focus on data integrity and error handling.

# Functions

### fd\_wksp\_private\_restore\_v1\_ulong<!-- {{#callable:fd_wksp_private_restore_v1_ulong}} -->
The function `fd_wksp_private_restore_v1_ulong` reads and decodes an encoded unsigned long integer from a buffered input stream.
- **Inputs**:
    - `in`: A pointer to a `fd_io_buffered_istream_t` structure representing the input stream from which the encoded unsigned long integer will be read.
    - `_val`: A pointer to an unsigned long variable where the decoded value will be stored.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize local variables for size (`csz`), buffer pointer (`buf`), and a temporary buffer (`_buf`).
    - Check the size of the prefetched data in the input stream using `fd_io_buffered_istream_peek_sz`.
    - If the prefetched size is at least 9 bytes, directly use the prefetched buffer to determine the size of the encoded value (`csz`) and adjust the stream position accordingly.
    - If the prefetched size is less than 9 bytes, read the first byte into `_buf` to determine `csz`, then read the remaining bytes of the encoded value into `_buf`.
    - Decode the encoded value using `fd_ulong_svw_dec_fixed` and store the result in `_val`.
    - Return 0 to indicate success, or an error code if reading from the stream fails.
- **Output**: Returns 0 on success, with the decoded unsigned long stored in `_val`; returns a non-zero error code on failure, with `_val` set to 0.

### fd\_wksp\_private\_restore\_v1\_buf<!-- {{#callable:fd_wksp_private_restore_v1_buf}} -->
The `fd_wksp_private_restore_v1_buf` function restores a buffer from a buffered input stream, ensuring the buffer size does not exceed a specified maximum.
- **Inputs**:
    - `in`: A pointer to a `fd_io_buffered_istream_t` structure representing the input stream from which the buffer is restored.
    - `buf`: A pointer to the buffer where the data will be restored.
    - `buf_max`: An unsigned long integer specifying the maximum size of the buffer.
    - `_buf_sz`: A pointer to an unsigned long integer where the size of the restored buffer will be stored.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Call [`fd_wksp_private_restore_v1_ulong`](#fd_wksp_private_restore_v1_ulong) to restore the buffer size (`buf_sz`) from the input stream.
    - Check if there was an error in restoring `buf_sz` or if `buf_sz` exceeds `buf_max`; if so, set `_buf_sz` to 0 and return the error code.
    - If no error, read `buf_sz` bytes from the input stream into `buf` using `fd_io_buffered_istream_read`.
    - Set `_buf_sz` to `buf_sz` if no error occurred during the read operation, otherwise set it to 0.
    - Return the error code from the read operation.
- **Output**: Returns 0 on success, with `buf` containing the restored data and `_buf_sz` containing the size of the restored buffer; returns a non-zero error code on failure, with `_buf_sz` set to 0.

### fd\_wksp\_private\_restore\_v1<!-- {{#callable:fd_wksp_private_restore_v1}} -->
The `fd_wksp_private_restore_v1` function restores a workspace from a checkpoint file into a given workspace structure, ensuring data integrity and handling errors during the process.
- **Inputs**:
    - `tpool`: A pointer to a thread pool, currently unused in this function.
    - `t0`: An unsigned long integer, currently unused in this function.
    - `t1`: An unsigned long integer, currently unused in this function.
    - `wksp`: A pointer to the workspace structure where the checkpoint will be restored.
    - `path`: A constant character pointer representing the file path to the checkpoint file.
    - `new_seed`: An unsigned integer representing the new seed for rebuilding the workspace.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Log the start of the restore process with the checkpoint path and workspace name.
