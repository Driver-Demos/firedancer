# Purpose
This C source code file defines functions for initializing and terminating a software framework, likely related to a system or application named "fd." The [`fd_boot`](#fd_boot) function is responsible for setting up the environment at the start of the program, ensuring that logging, shared memory, and tile (or thread) management are initialized. Conversely, the [`fd_halt`](#fd_halt) function is designed to clean up these resources just before the program terminates. Additionally, if the code is compiled in a hosted environment (indicated by the `FD_HAS_HOSTED` macro), it includes a function [`fd_yield`](#fd_yield) that calls `sched_yield()` to voluntarily yield the processor, allowing other threads to run. This file is likely part of a larger system that manages resources and execution flow in a multi-threaded or distributed environment.

# Functions

---
### fd\_boot<!-- {{#callable:fd_boot}} -->
The `fd_boot` function initializes the program's environment by booting the logging, shared memory, and tile subsystems using the provided command-line arguments.
- **Inputs**:
    - `pargc`: A pointer to an integer representing the number of command-line arguments.
    - `pargv`: A pointer to an array of strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function begins execution immediately after the program starts, with only one thread of execution and before any subsystem has been booted.
    - It calls `fd_log_private_boot` with `pargc` and `pargv` to initialize the logging subsystem.
    - It calls `fd_shmem_private_boot` with `pargc` and `pargv` to initialize the shared memory subsystem.
    - It calls `fd_tile_private_boot` with `pargc` and `pargv`, setting the caller as tile 0, to initialize the tile subsystem.
- **Output**: The function does not return any value; it performs initialization tasks for the program's environment.


---
### fd\_halt<!-- {{#callable:fd_halt}} -->
The `fd_halt` function performs cleanup operations for the 'fd' system components before program termination.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function calls `fd_tile_private_halt()` to perform cleanup related to tile management.
    - It then calls `fd_shmem_private_halt()` to handle shared memory cleanup.
    - Finally, it calls `fd_log_private_halt()` to finalize logging operations.
- **Output**: The function does not return any value.


---
### fd\_yield<!-- {{#callable:fd_yield}} -->
The `fd_yield` function calls the `sched_yield` function to yield the processor, allowing other threads to run.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function calls the `sched_yield` function from the standard library.
    - The `sched_yield` function hints to the operating system scheduler to allow other threads to run by yielding the processor.
- **Output**: The function does not return any value.
