# Purpose
This C source code file is an executable program designed to test the correctness of square root functions for various integer types. The program includes headers for utility functions and square root operations, indicating that it relies on external libraries or modules for these functionalities. The main function initializes a random number generator and performs 50 million iterations of tests on square root calculations for different integer types, including unsigned and signed 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit, and 64-bit integers. The tests verify that the computed square roots and their residuals meet expected mathematical properties, logging errors if any discrepancies are found.

The code is structured to provide comprehensive validation of square root functions, ensuring they handle edge cases and produce accurate results across a range of integer sizes. It uses macros to define test cases for each integer type, which simplifies the repetitive nature of the tests and ensures consistency. The program logs progress at regular intervals and reports any failures encountered during the tests. Upon successful completion of all tests, it logs a "pass" message. This file is primarily focused on testing and validation rather than providing a public API or external interface, as it does not define functions or structures intended for use outside of this specific testing context.

# Functions

---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function initializes a random number generator and performs 50 million iterations of testing various square root functions for different integer types, logging progress and errors.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments passed to the program.
    - `argv`: An array of strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function begins by calling `fd_boot` to initialize the environment with command-line arguments.
    - A random number generator is initialized using `fd_rng_new` and `fd_rng_join`.
    - A loop runs for 50 million iterations, logging progress every 1 million iterations.
    - Within the loop, a macro `TEST` is defined and used to test square root functions for different integer types (uchar, ushort, uint, ulong) and their signed counterparts (schar, short, int, long).
    - Each test involves generating a random number, computing its square root, and checking the result against expected properties, logging errors if any discrepancies are found.
    - After the loop, the random number generator is cleaned up using `fd_rng_leave` and `fd_rng_delete`.
    - A final log message indicates successful completion, and `fd_halt` is called before returning 0.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer value of 0, indicating successful execution.
