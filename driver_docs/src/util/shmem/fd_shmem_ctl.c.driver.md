# Purpose
This C source code file implements a command-line utility for managing shared memory segments, specifically designed to operate in a hosted environment. The program provides a variety of commands to interact with shared memory, such as querying the number of CPUs and NUMA nodes, creating and unlinking shared memory segments, and querying information about existing segments. The utility is structured to handle different commands passed as arguments, with each command performing specific operations related to shared memory management. The code includes error handling and logging to ensure that operations are executed correctly and any issues are reported to the user.

The file is an executable C program, as indicated by the presence of the [`main`](#main) function, which serves as the entry point. It imports necessary utilities and definitions from other files, such as `fd_util.h`, and uses a series of helper functions to perform its tasks. The program defines a public interface through its command-line arguments, allowing users to execute commands like "help", "cpu-cnt", "numa-cnt", "create", "unlink", and "query". Each command is processed in a loop, with the program shifting through the arguments and executing the corresponding functionality. The code is designed to be robust, with checks for argument validity and appropriate error messages to guide users in case of incorrect usage.

# Functions

---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function initializes the program, processes command-line arguments to execute shared memory control commands, and logs the results.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments passed to the program.
    - `argv`: An array of strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function starts by calling `fd_boot` to initialize the program environment with the command-line arguments.
    - It checks if the number of arguments is less than 1, logging an error if true.
    - The first argument is stored as `bin`, and the argument list is shifted to process subsequent commands.
    - A loop iterates over the remaining arguments, interpreting each as a command and executing the corresponding logic.
    - For each recognized command ('help', 'cpu-cnt', 'numa-cnt', 'cpu-idx', 'numa-idx', 'create', 'unlink', 'query'), the function performs specific operations, such as printing information or modifying shared memory settings.
    - If an unrecognized command is encountered, an error is logged.
    - After processing all commands, the function logs the number of processed commands.
    - Finally, `fd_halt` is called to clean up, and the function returns 0.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer value of 0, indicating successful execution.
