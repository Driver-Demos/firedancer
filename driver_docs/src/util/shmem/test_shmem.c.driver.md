# Purpose
This C source code file is a comprehensive unit test for shared memory management functions, specifically focusing on the functionalities provided by the `fd_shmem` library. The code is structured to validate various aspects of shared memory operations, including joining and leaving shared memory segments, querying shared memory information, and handling different page sizes. It uses a series of assertions and tests to ensure that the shared memory operations behave as expected under various conditions. The file includes tests for name validation, page size conversion, and the integrity of join and leave operations, ensuring that shared memory segments are correctly managed and queried.

The code is designed to be executed as a standalone program, as indicated by the presence of a [`main`](#main) function. It includes static assertions to verify compile-time constants and runtime tests to validate the behavior of shared memory functions. The tests cover a wide range of scenarios, including edge cases for invalid inputs and stress tests with random data. The file is intended to be run in an environment with hosted capabilities (`FD_HAS_HOSTED`), and it logs detailed information about the test results. This file is crucial for developers to ensure the reliability and correctness of the shared memory management functionalities in the `fd_shmem` library.
# Imports and Dependencies

- `../fd_util.h`
- `ctype.h`
- `errno.h`


# Functions

---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function initializes the environment and logs a warning if the FD_HAS_HOSTED capabilities are not available, then halts the program.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The count of command-line arguments passed to the program.
    - `argv`: An array of strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Call `fd_boot` to initialize the environment with the command-line arguments.
    - Log a warning message indicating that the unit test requires FD_HAS_HOSTED capabilities.
    - Call `fd_halt` to terminate the program.
    - Return 0 to indicate successful execution.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer value of 0, indicating successful execution.
