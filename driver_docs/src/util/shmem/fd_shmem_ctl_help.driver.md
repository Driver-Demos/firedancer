# Purpose
The provided content is a usage guide for a command-line utility named `fd_shmem_ctl`, which is designed to manage shared memory regions in a system. The utility offers several commands, including `help` for displaying usage information, `cpu-cnt` and `numa-cnt` for retrieving the number of CPUs and NUMA nodes, respectively, and `cpu-idx` and `numa-idx` for determining the relationship between CPUs and NUMA nodes. Additionally, the `create` command allows users to create a shared memory region with specified parameters such as name, page count, page size, CPU index sequence, and permissions. The `unlink` command is used to remove a shared memory region, while the `query` command provides detailed information about a specified shared memory region. This utility is particularly useful for systems that require efficient memory management and allocation near specific CPUs or NUMA nodes.
