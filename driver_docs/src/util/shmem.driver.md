## Files
- **[fd_numa_linux.c](shmem/fd_numa_linux.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_numa_linux.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase provides functions for interacting with NUMA (Non-Uniform Memory Access) configurations on Linux systems, including parsing node indices, counting NUMA nodes and CPUs, and managing memory policies using syscalls.
- **[fd_numa_stub.c](shmem/fd_numa_stub.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_numa_stub.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase provides stub implementations for NUMA-related functions, logging warnings and returning error codes due to lack of NUMA support for the build target.
- **[fd_shmem.h](shmem/fd_shmem.h.driver.md)**: The `fd_shmem.h` file in the `firedancer` codebase provides APIs for managing NUMA-aware and page size-aware interprocess shared memory topologies, including functions for joining, leaving, creating, and querying shared memory regions.
- **[fd_shmem_admin.c](shmem/fd_shmem_admin.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_shmem_admin.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase provides functions for managing shared memory, including creating, updating, and unlinking shared memory regions, as well as handling NUMA topology and memory policies.
- **[fd_shmem_cfg](shmem/fd_shmem_cfg.driver.md)**: The `fd_shmem_cfg` file is a Bash script for managing shared memory configurations in the Firedancer codebase, providing commands to initialize, finalize, allocate, free, query, and reset shared memory regions using hugetlbfs.
- **[fd_shmem_ctl.c](shmem/fd_shmem_ctl.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_shmem_ctl.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase implements a command-line utility for managing shared memory, including commands for querying, creating, and unlinking shared memory segments, as well as retrieving CPU and NUMA information.
- **[fd_shmem_ctl_help](shmem/fd_shmem_ctl_help.driver.md)**: The `fd_shmem_ctl_help` file provides command-line usage instructions for managing shared memory regions, including commands for querying CPU and NUMA node information, creating, unlinking, and querying shared memory regions.
- **[fd_shmem_private.h](shmem/fd_shmem_private.h.driver.md)**: The `fd_shmem_private.h` file in the `firedancer` codebase provides private shared memory utilities, including NUMA-related functions and memory locking mechanisms, with support for thread safety using pthreads.
- **[fd_shmem_user.c](shmem/fd_shmem_user.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_shmem_user.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase provides functions for managing shared memory regions, including joining, leaving, and querying shared memory mappings, with support for both named and anonymous regions.
- **[Local.mk](shmem/Local.mk.driver.md)**: The `Local.mk` file in the `firedancer` codebase specifies the build configuration for shared memory utilities, including headers, objects, scripts, binaries, and unit tests, with conditional object inclusion based on the `FD_HAS_HOSTED` flag.
- **[test_shmem.c](shmem/test_shmem.c.driver.md)**: The `test_shmem.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase contains unit tests for shared memory operations, including validation of NUMA and CPU indices, name length checks, page size conversions, and join/leave operations.
- **[test_shmem_ctl](shmem/test_shmem_ctl.driver.md)**: The `test_shmem_ctl` file is a Bash script that tests various functionalities of the `fd_shmem_ctl` command, including operations like create, query, and unlink, within the `firedancer` codebase.
