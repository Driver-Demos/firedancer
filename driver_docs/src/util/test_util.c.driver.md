# Purpose
This code is a simple C program that serves as a basic template for initializing and terminating a framework or library, likely related to the "fd" (possibly "framework daemon" or similar) utility functions. It includes a header file "fd_util.h" which presumably contains declarations for the `fd_boot`, `FD_LOG_NOTICE`, and `fd_halt` functions. The [`main`](#main) function initializes the framework with `fd_boot`, logs a notice message "pass" using `FD_LOG_NOTICE`, and then gracefully shuts down the framework with `fd_halt`. This structure suggests the program is designed to ensure proper setup and teardown of the environment, possibly for testing or demonstration purposes.
# Imports and Dependencies

# Functions

---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function initializes the program, logs a notice, and then halts execution.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: An integer representing the number of command-line arguments passed to the program.
    - `argv`: An array of character pointers listing all the arguments passed to the program.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function begins by calling [`fd_boot`](fd_util.c.driver.md#fd_boot) with pointers to `argc` and `argv` to perform any necessary initialization.
    - A log notice with the message "pass" is recorded using `FD_LOG_NOTICE`.
    - The function calls [`fd_halt`](fd_util.c.driver.md#fd_halt) to perform any necessary cleanup or shutdown procedures.
    - Finally, the function returns 0, indicating successful execution.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer value of 0, indicating successful execution.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`fd_boot`](fd_util.c.driver.md#fd_boot)
    - [`fd_halt`](fd_util.c.driver.md#fd_halt)
