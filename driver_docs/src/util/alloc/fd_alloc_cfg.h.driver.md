# Purpose
This C header file, `fd_alloc_cfg.h`, is part of a memory allocation system designed to efficiently manage memory allocation requests of varying sizes. The file defines a configuration for a custom allocator that organizes memory into superblocks of different sizes, each further divided into blocks. The allocator supports five superblock sizes: tiny, small, medium, large, and huge, with each size having a specific footprint and a set of size classes. The configuration is optimized to handle small allocations with high frequency and short lifetimes by grouping them into superblocks, thereby reducing the overhead associated with individual allocations. The file defines constants and a structure, `fd_alloc_sizeclass_cfg_t`, which holds the configuration for each size class, including the superblock footprint, block footprint, block count, and concurrency group mask.

The file provides a detailed, precomputed table of 126 size classes, each specifying how memory is divided within a superblock. This table is used to quickly determine the appropriate size class for a given allocation request, facilitating rapid memory allocation and deallocation. The configuration is designed to minimize space and time overheads by clustering similarly sized allocations and allowing for customization to match specific application needs. The header file does not define any public APIs or external interfaces directly but serves as a configuration component within a larger memory management system, likely to be included and utilized by other parts of the system that handle memory allocation tasks.
# Global Variables

---
### fd\_alloc\_sizeclass\_cfg
- **Type**: ``fd_alloc_sizeclass_cfg_t const[126]``
- **Description**: The `fd_alloc_sizeclass_cfg` is a static constant array of 126 elements, each of type `fd_alloc_sizeclass_cfg_t`. This array defines various size classes for memory allocation, with each element specifying the configuration for a particular size class, including the superblock footprint, block footprint, block count, and concurrency group mask. The size classes are designed to optimize memory allocation by grouping allocations into superblocks of different sizes, ranging from tiny to huge, to reduce overhead and improve performance.
- **Use**: This variable is used to configure and manage memory allocation size classes, facilitating efficient allocation and deallocation of memory blocks within predefined superblock sizes.


# Data Structures

---
### fd\_alloc\_sizeclass\_cfg
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `superblock_footprint`: Size of the allocation needed to make a superblock for this class.
    - `block_footprint`: Footprint of blocks in this size class, ensuring block_cnt*block_footprint+16 <= superblock_footprint.
    - `block_cnt`: Number of blocks in this size class, ranging from 1 to 64.
    - `cgroup_mask`: Number of cgroups for this sizeclass minus 1, a power of 2 minus 1, at most CGROUP_HINT_MAX.
- **Description**: The `fd_alloc_sizeclass_cfg` structure is designed to configure size classes for memory allocation, specifically for managing superblocks in a memory allocator. It defines the footprint of a superblock, the footprint of individual blocks within that superblock, the count of such blocks, and a mask for concurrency groups. This configuration allows for efficient memory allocation by grouping smaller allocations into superblocks, reducing overhead and improving performance. The structure is aligned to 8 bytes to ensure optimal memory access and is part of a system that supports up to 126 size classes, each tailored to different allocation sizes.

### fd\_alloc\_sizeclass\_cfg\_t
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `superblock_footprint`: Size of the allocation needed to make a superblock for this class.
    - `block_footprint`: Footprint of blocks in this size class, ensuring block count times block footprint plus 16 is less than or equal to superblock footprint.
    - `block_cnt`: Number of blocks in this size class, ranging from 1 to 64.
    - `cgroup_mask`: Number of concurrency groups for this size class minus 1, a power of 2 minus 1, with a maximum of CGROUP_HINT_MAX.
- **Description**: The `fd_alloc_sizeclass_cfg_t` structure is designed to configure size classes for memory allocation, particularly in the context of superblock management. It defines the parameters for creating superblocks, including the total footprint required, the size of individual blocks within the superblock, and the number of such blocks. Additionally, it specifies the concurrency group mask, which is used to manage allocation concurrency. This structure is part of a system that optimizes memory allocation by grouping smaller allocations into superblocks, thereby reducing overhead and improving allocation efficiency.
