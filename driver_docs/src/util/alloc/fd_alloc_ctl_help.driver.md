# Purpose
The provided content appears to be a command-line interface (CLI) usage guide for a memory allocation control tool, likely named `fd_alloc_ctl`. This tool is designed to manage memory allocations within a workspace (wksp) environment, providing commands for creating, deleting, allocating, freeing, compacting, and querying memory allocations. The functionality is relatively narrow, focusing specifically on memory management tasks, such as setting tags for allocations, creating new allocations, and optimizing memory usage for concurrency. The commands are conceptually organized around the lifecycle of memory management, from allocation to deallocation, with additional capabilities for querying the state of allocations. This file is relevant to a codebase as it provides essential instructions for developers or system administrators to efficiently manage memory resources, ensuring optimal performance and resource utilization in applications that rely on dynamic memory allocation.
# Content Summary
The provided content is a usage guide for a command-line tool named `fd_alloc_ctl`, which is used for managing memory allocations within a workspace (wksp) environment. This tool provides several commands to control and query memory allocations, each with specific arguments and behaviors.

Key commands include:

- **help**: Displays the usage instructions for the tool, detailing available commands and their functions.

- **tag val**: Sets a tag for subsequent workspace allocations, with a default value of 1. This tag is used to identify and manage allocations.

- **new wksp wksp_tag**: Creates a new allocator backed by a specified workspace. Allocations made by this allocator are tagged with `wksp_tag`, which should be unique. The command outputs the global address (gaddr) of the new allocator on success.

- **delete alloc_gaddr garbage_collect**: Deletes an allocator at a given global address. If `garbage_collect` is non-zero, it also frees any unfreed allocations. Otherwise, allocations remain in the workspace for potential later cleanup.

- **malloc alloc_gaddr cgroup_idx align sz**: Allocates a specified size of memory with a given alignment using the allocator at `alloc_gaddr`. The alignment is optimized for a specified concurrency group. The command outputs the global address of the allocated memory on success.

- **free alloc_gaddr cgroup_idx malloc_gaddr**: Frees a previously allocated memory block, optimizing it for future reuse by a specified concurrency group. The operation logs any anomalies but is designed to always succeed.

- **compact alloc_gaddr**: Releases any unnecessary workspace allocations that are not required for outstanding memory allocations, optimizing future allocation performance.

- **query what alloc_gaddr**: Provides information about the allocator at `alloc_gaddr`. The `what` parameter specifies the type of information, such as testing existence, retrieving tags, checking for memory leaks, or obtaining detailed status. The command logs any anomalies but is designed to always succeed.

This tool is essential for developers managing memory allocations in a concurrent environment, providing mechanisms for efficient memory usage, cleanup, and diagnostics.
