# Purpose
This C source code file is a comprehensive unit test for a custom memory allocation system, specifically designed to test the robustness and correctness of memory allocation and deallocation operations. The code is structured to perform a series of "torture tests" on the memory allocator, which involve allocating and freeing memory in various patterns and sizes, both within a single thread and across multiple threads. The primary focus is on ensuring that the allocator can handle a large number of allocations and deallocations without errors, such as memory corruption or misalignment. The code also includes mechanisms to verify that memory patterns are preserved between allocation and deallocation, which helps in detecting any potential memory corruption issues.

The file is intended to be compiled and executed as a standalone program, as indicated by the presence of a [`main`](#main) function. It includes several static assertions to ensure that certain compile-time conditions are met, such as alignment and footprint requirements. The code also makes use of a custom logging and random number generation system, which are likely part of a larger framework or library. The program is designed to be run in an environment with multiple processing units (tiles), and it uses these tiles to execute tests in parallel, further stressing the allocator's capabilities. The file does not define public APIs or external interfaces; instead, it serves as an internal testing tool to validate the functionality and reliability of the memory allocation system.

# Global Variables

---
### \_go
- **Type**: `int`
- **Description**: The `_go` variable is a static integer used as a flag to control the execution flow of the program. It is initialized to zero and is used to signal when certain operations should begin.
- **Use**: The `_go` variable is used to pause execution in loops until it is set to a non-zero value, indicating that the program should proceed with its operations.


---
### \_shalloc
- **Type**: `void *`
- **Description**: `_shalloc` is a static global variable of type `void *` that is used to store a pointer to a shared memory allocation. It is initialized in the `main` function after a successful allocation of workspace memory for `fd_alloc`. This variable is used to manage memory allocations across different threads or processes.
- **Use**: `_shalloc` is used to store and provide access to the shared memory allocation for memory management operations in the program.


---
### \_alloc\_cnt
- **Type**: `ulong`
- **Description**: The `_alloc_cnt` variable is a static global variable of type `ulong` that is used to store the count of allocations to be performed in the memory allocation test. It is initialized with a default value of 1048576UL, which can be overridden by a command-line argument.
- **Use**: This variable is used to determine the number of allocation operations to be executed during the memory allocation torture test.


---
### \_align\_max
- **Type**: `ulong`
- **Description**: The `_align_max` variable is a static global variable of type `ulong` that represents the maximum alignment value used in memory allocation operations within the program. It is initialized with a value from the command line or a default value and is used to determine the alignment constraints for memory allocations.
- **Use**: It is used to set the maximum alignment constraint for memory allocations in the program's memory management routines.


---
### \_sz\_max
- **Type**: `ulong`
- **Description**: The `_sz_max` variable is a static global variable of type `ulong` that represents the maximum size for memory allocations in the program. It is used to determine the upper limit for the size of memory blocks that can be allocated during the execution of the program.

---
### test2\_slot
- **Type**: `array of structs`
- **Description**: `test2_slot` is a static array of structs, each aligned to 128 bytes, with a maximum size defined by `TEST2_SLOT_MAX`. Each struct contains fields for a lock, a memory pointer, size, a pattern, and a source identifier. This structure is used to manage memory allocations and their associated metadata in a concurrent environment.
- **Use**: `test2_slot` is used to store and manage memory allocations, ensuring thread-safe access and integrity of the memory through locking and pattern validation.


# Functions

---
### test\_main<!-- {{#callable:test_main}} -->
The `test_main` function performs a stress test on memory allocation and deallocation using a custom allocator, simulating random allocation and deallocation operations to ensure memory integrity and alignment.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments passed to the program.
    - `argv`: An array of strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize variables and constants for memory allocation parameters and random number generation.
    - Wait for a volatile flag `_go` to be set before starting the main loop.
    - Iterate over a loop twice the number of `alloc_cnt` to perform allocation and deallocation operations.
    - Determine whether to allocate or free memory based on the number of outstanding allocations and a random decision.
    - For allocation, randomly determine size and alignment, allocate memory, and fill it with a unique pattern for later verification.
    - For deallocation, randomly select an outstanding allocation, verify the memory pattern, and free the memory.
    - Log memory allocation information periodically if certain conditions are met.
    - After the loop, clean up by leaving the allocator and deleting the random number generator.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer value of 0, indicating successful execution.
- **Functions called**:

# Function Declarations (Public API)

---
### fd\_alloc\_fprintf<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_alloc_fprintf}} -->
Prints diagnostic information about a memory allocator to a specified stream.
- **Description**: Use this function to output detailed diagnostic information about a memory allocator's state to a given stream, such as a file or standard output. This function is useful for debugging and monitoring the allocator's usage and health. It requires a valid memory allocator join object and a non-null stream to print the information. If the stream is null, the function will return immediately with no output. The function does not modify the allocator or the stream, but it will return the number of characters printed if successful.
- **Inputs**:
    - `join`: A pointer to a `fd_alloc_t` object representing the memory allocator join. It must be a valid, non-null pointer to a properly initialized allocator join object.
    - `stream`: A pointer to a `FILE` object where the diagnostic information will be printed. It must not be null. If it is null, the function will return 0 and perform no printing.
- **Output**: Returns the number of characters printed to the stream. If the stream is null, returns 0.
