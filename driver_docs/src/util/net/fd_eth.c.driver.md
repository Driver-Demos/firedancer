# Purpose
The provided C source code file is designed to perform operations related to Ethernet frame checksums and MAC address conversions. It includes a function [`fd_eth_fcs_append`](#fd_eth_fcs_append) that calculates the Frame Check Sequence (FCS) for Ethernet frames using a CRC-32 algorithm. This function utilizes a precomputed table of CRC values to efficiently compute the checksum for a given buffer of data. The table is a static array of 256 unsigned integers, which is a common optimization technique for CRC calculations to speed up the process by avoiding repeated calculations.

Additionally, the file contains a utility function [`fd_cstr_to_mac_addr`](#fd_cstr_to_mac_addr) that converts a string representation of a MAC address into its binary form. This function ensures that the input string is correctly formatted as a MAC address (e.g., "00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E") and converts each pair of hexadecimal digits into a byte. The function [`ascii_to_xdigit`](#ascii_to_xdigit) is used internally to convert ASCII characters to their hexadecimal digit values. This code is likely part of a larger library or application dealing with network communications, where efficient and accurate processing of Ethernet frames and MAC addresses is crucial.

# Functions

### fd\_eth\_fcs\_append<!-- {{#callable:fd_eth_fcs_append}} -->
The `fd_eth_fcs_append` function calculates the Frame Check Sequence (FCS) for a given buffer using a CRC-32 algorithm, starting from a specified seed value.
- **Inputs**:
    - `seed`: An initial CRC value used to start the calculation.
    - `buf`: A pointer to the buffer containing the data for which the FCS is to be calculated.
    - `sz`: The size of the buffer in bytes.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize the CRC value by inverting the seed.
    - Cast the buffer pointer to a pointer to unsigned characters for byte-wise processing.
    - Iterate over each byte in the buffer, updating the CRC value using a lookup table and bitwise operations.
    - Invert the final CRC value before returning it.
- **Output**: The function returns the computed CRC-32 value as an unsigned integer.


---
### ascii\_to\_xdigit<!-- {{#callable:ascii_to_xdigit}} -->
The `ascii_to_xdigit` function converts a single ASCII character representing a hexadecimal digit into its corresponding numeric value, returning 16 for non-hexadecimal characters.
- **Inputs**:
    - `c`: A character representing a potential hexadecimal digit.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Convert the input character `c` to an unsigned long integer `ul`.
    - Calculate the index for a lookup in a 64-bit table to determine if `c` is a valid hexadecimal digit using bit manipulation and range checking.
    - Use `fd_ulong_if` to return the numeric value of the hexadecimal digit if valid, or 16 if not.
    - The numeric value is calculated as `(ul & 15UL) + 9UL*(ulong)(ul>(ulong)(uchar)'9')`, which adjusts for characters 'A'-'F' and 'a'-'f'.
- **Output**: Returns an unsigned long integer representing the numeric value of the hexadecimal digit, or 16 if the character is not a valid hexadecimal digit.


---
### fd\_cstr\_to\_mac\_addr<!-- {{#callable:fd_cstr_to_mac_addr}} -->
The `fd_cstr_to_mac_addr` function converts a string representation of a MAC address into a byte array.
- **Inputs**:
    - `s`: A pointer to a null-terminated string representing a MAC address in the format 'XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX', where 'XX' are hexadecimal digits.
    - `mac`: A pointer to an array of unsigned characters where the converted MAC address will be stored.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if either input pointer is NULL and return NULL if so.
    - Iterate over each pair of hexadecimal digits in the input string, expecting a colon ':' separator between each pair except the last.
    - Convert each pair of hexadecimal characters to a byte using the [`ascii_to_xdigit`](#ascii_to_xdigit) function and store it in the `mac` array.
    - If any character is not a valid hexadecimal digit or if the expected colon is missing, return NULL.
    - After processing all pairs, return the `mac` array.
- **Output**: Returns a pointer to the `mac` array containing the converted MAC address, or NULL if the input string is invalid or if any input pointer is NULL.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`ascii_to_xdigit`](#ascii_to_xdigit)
