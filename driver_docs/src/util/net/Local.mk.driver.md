# Purpose
The provided content is from a Makefile, which is a build automation tool used to manage the build process of software projects. This particular Makefile snippet is designed to automate the compilation and testing of various components related to network protocols, such as Ethernet (fd_eth), IPv4 (fd_ip4), IPv6 (fd_ip6), IGMP (fd_igmp), UDP (fd_udp), and packet capture formats (fd_pcap, fd_pcapng). The `add-hdrs` and `add-objs` functions are used to include header files and object files necessary for building these components. The `make-unit-test` and `run-unit-test` functions are employed to create and execute unit tests for each protocol component, ensuring their functionality is verified. Additionally, conditional logic is used with `ifdef FD_HAS_HOSTED` to include tests and fuzz testing for the pcapng format if the hosted environment is available, enhancing the robustness of the software by testing its resilience to unexpected inputs.
