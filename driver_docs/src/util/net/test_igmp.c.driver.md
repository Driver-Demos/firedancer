# Purpose
This C source code file is a unit test script designed to verify the integrity and correctness of certain data structures and constants related to the Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP). It includes assertions to ensure that specific IGMP type constants match expected values and that the sizes of the `fd_igmp_t` and `fd_ip4_igmp_t` structures are as anticipated. The [`main`](#main) function performs a series of tests to confirm the correct memory layout of these structures by checking the offsets of their fields. The script uses utility functions like `fd_boot`, `FD_TEST`, and `fd_halt` from included headers to initialize the test environment, execute the tests, and clean up afterward. Notably, there are placeholders for additional tests (`FIXME` comments) indicating areas for future development or verification.
# Imports and Dependencies

# Functions

---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function initializes the environment, performs a series of static assertions and memory layout checks on IGMP-related structures, logs a success message, and then halts the program.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The count of command-line arguments passed to the program.
    - `argv`: An array of strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function begins by calling `fd_boot` to initialize the environment with the command-line arguments.
    - It performs a series of `FD_TEST` assertions to verify the memory layout of the `fd_igmp_t` and `fd_ip4_igmp_t` structures, ensuring that the offsets of their fields match expected values.
    - Two `FIXME` comments indicate that additional tests for `FD_IGMP_CHECK` and `FD_IP4_IGMP` are needed but not yet implemented.
    - A log message 'pass' is recorded using `FD_LOG_NOTICE` to indicate successful completion of the tests.
    - The function calls `fd_halt` to perform any necessary cleanup and then returns 0, indicating successful execution.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer value of 0, indicating successful execution.
