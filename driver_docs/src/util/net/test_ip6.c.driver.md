# Purpose
This C source code file is an executable program designed to test the functionality of IPv6 and IPv4 address manipulation, specifically focusing on IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses. The code includes headers for IPv6 and IPv4 utilities, as well as a general utility header, indicating that it relies on external libraries or modules for its operations. The main function initializes the environment, performs a series of tests to verify the correct mapping of an IPv4 address to an IPv6 address, and checks the integrity of this mapping through bitwise operations. It uses a series of assertions (via `FD_TEST`) to ensure that the operations produce the expected results, such as confirming that the IPv6 address is correctly identified as an IPv4-mapped address and that the original IPv4 address can be accurately retrieved from the mapped IPv6 address.

The program is structured to provide a narrow functionality focused on validating the conversion and identification of IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses. It does not define public APIs or external interfaces but rather serves as a standalone test suite to ensure the correctness of the address conversion utilities. The use of `fd_boot` and `fd_halt` suggests that the program is part of a larger framework or system that requires initialization and cleanup routines. The successful execution of the tests is logged with a notice, indicating that the program's primary purpose is to verify the reliability and accuracy of the address conversion functions provided by the included utility headers.

# Functions

---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function initializes the environment, tests IPv6 to IPv4 address mapping functionalities, and logs the results before halting the program.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The count of command-line arguments passed to the program.
    - `argv`: An array of strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Call `fd_boot` to initialize the environment with command-line arguments.
    - Declare a 16-byte array `ip6_addr` to store an IPv6 address.
    - Map the IPv4 address 10.1.2.3 to an IPv6 address and store it in `ip6_addr`.
    - Verify that `ip6_addr` matches the expected IPv6 representation of the IPv4 address using `fd_memeq`.
    - Check that `ip6_addr` is recognized as an IPv4-mapped IPv6 address using [`fd_ip6_addr_is_ip4_mapped`](fd_ip6.h.driver.md#fd_ip6_addr_is_ip4_mapped).
    - Iterate over the first 10 bytes of `ip6_addr`, flipping each bit and verifying that the address is no longer recognized as IPv4-mapped, then restore the original bit.
    - Verify that converting `ip6_addr` back to an IPv4 address yields 10.1.2.3 using [`fd_ip6_addr_to_ip4`](fd_ip6.h.driver.md#fd_ip6_addr_to_ip4).
    - Log a notice indicating the tests passed.
    - Call `fd_halt` to clean up and terminate the program.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer value of 0, indicating successful execution.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`fd_ip6_addr_ip4_mapped`](fd_ip6.h.driver.md#fd_ip6_addr_ip4_mapped)
    - [`fd_ip6_addr_is_ip4_mapped`](fd_ip6.h.driver.md#fd_ip6_addr_is_ip4_mapped)
    - [`fd_ip6_addr_to_ip4`](fd_ip6.h.driver.md#fd_ip6_addr_to_ip4)
