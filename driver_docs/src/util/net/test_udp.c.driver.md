# Purpose
This C source code file is a unit test script designed to verify the structure and alignment of UDP and IP4/UDP header data types. It includes static assertions to ensure that the `fd_udp_hdr_t` and `fd_ip4_udp_hdrs_t` structures have the expected alignment and size, which are critical for network packet processing. The [`main`](#main) function further tests the offsets of various fields within the `fd_udp_hdr_t` structure to confirm they match expected values, ensuring the integrity of the data layout. The script uses the `fd_boot` and `fd_halt` functions to initialize and finalize the test environment, and it logs a notice upon successful completion of the tests. A placeholder comment indicates a missing test for `FD_IP4_UDP_CHECK`, suggesting an area for future development.

# Functions

---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function initializes the environment, performs static assertions on the offsets of fields within a UDP header structure, logs a success message, and then halts the program.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The count of command-line arguments passed to the program.
    - `argv`: An array of strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function begins by calling `fd_boot` to initialize the environment with the command-line arguments.
    - It performs a series of tests using `FD_TEST` to assert that the offsets of various fields within a `fd_udp_hdr_t` structure match expected values.
    - A comment indicates a placeholder for a test related to `FD_IP4_UDP_CHECK` that is not yet implemented.
    - A log message 'pass' is recorded using `FD_LOG_NOTICE`.
    - The function calls `fd_halt` to perform any necessary cleanup and halt the program.
    - Finally, the function returns 0, indicating successful execution.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer value of 0, indicating successful execution.
