# Purpose
This C source code file is designed to perform unit testing for IPv4 address manipulation and validation functions. It includes static assertions to verify the correctness of various constants related to IPv4 headers, such as type of service, fragment offsets, and protocol identifiers. The file defines two static functions, [`test_cstr_to_ip4_addr`](#test_cstr_to_ip4_addr) and [`test_ip4_addr_is_public`](#test_ip4_addr_is_public), which test the conversion of string representations of IP addresses to their numeric form and the classification of IP addresses as public or private, respectively. These tests ensure that the functions behave as expected under various input conditions, including edge cases.

The file also contains a [`main`](#main) function that initializes the testing environment, performs additional tests on the structure and alignment of the `fd_ip4_hdr_t` type, and checks the functionality of multicast and broadcast address detection. The use of `FD_TEST` macros indicates a framework for automated testing, and the presence of `FD_LOG_NOTICE` calls suggests logging of test results. The code is structured to be part of a larger test suite, likely integrated into a build system for continuous integration or development purposes. The file does not define public APIs or external interfaces but rather focuses on internal validation of IPv4-related utilities.

# Functions

### test\_cstr\_to\_ip4\_addr<!-- {{#callable:test_cstr_to_ip4_addr}} -->
The function `test_cstr_to_ip4_addr` tests the conversion of various string representations of IPv4 addresses to their numeric form using the [`fd_cstr_to_ip4_addr`](fd_ip4.c.driver.md#fd_cstr_to_ip4_addr) function.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - Declare a variable `ip` of type `uint` to store the converted IP address.
    - Call [`fd_cstr_to_ip4_addr`](fd_ip4.c.driver.md#fd_cstr_to_ip4_addr) with different string inputs representing IPv4 addresses and check if the conversion is successful using `FD_TEST`.
    - For valid IP addresses, verify that the conversion result matches the expected numeric value.
    - Test various invalid IP address strings to ensure the conversion function returns 0, indicating failure.
- **Output**: The function does not return any value; it performs assertions to validate the behavior of [`fd_cstr_to_ip4_addr`](fd_ip4.c.driver.md#fd_cstr_to_ip4_addr).
- **Functions called**:
    - [`fd_cstr_to_ip4_addr`](fd_ip4.c.driver.md#fd_cstr_to_ip4_addr)


---
### test\_ip4\_addr\_is\_public<!-- {{#callable:test_ip4_addr_is_public}} -->
The function `test_ip4_addr_is_public` tests the [`fd_ip4_addr_is_public`](fd_ip4.h.driver.md#fd_ip4_addr_is_public) function to ensure it correctly identifies public and private IPv4 addresses.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function calls [`fd_ip4_addr_is_public`](fd_ip4.h.driver.md#fd_ip4_addr_is_public) with various public IP addresses and uses `FD_TEST` to assert that the return value is 1, indicating they are public.
    - It then calls [`fd_ip4_addr_is_public`](fd_ip4.h.driver.md#fd_ip4_addr_is_public) with various private IP addresses and uses `FD_TEST` to assert that the return value is 0, indicating they are private.
    - The function also tests a loopback address to ensure it is correctly identified as non-public.
    - Additional tests are performed on a range of private IP addresses to ensure comprehensive coverage.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it uses assertions to validate the behavior of [`fd_ip4_addr_is_public`](fd_ip4.h.driver.md#fd_ip4_addr_is_public).
- **Functions called**:
    - [`fd_ip4_addr_is_public`](fd_ip4.h.driver.md#fd_ip4_addr_is_public)

### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function initializes the environment, performs a series of tests on IP header fields and IP addresses, and logs the results.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The count of command-line arguments passed to the program.
    - `argv`: An array of strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Call `fd_boot` to initialize the environment with command-line arguments.
    - Perform a series of `FD_TEST` assertions to verify the offsets of various fields in the `fd_ip4_hdr_t` structure.
    - Define and test three IP addresses (unicast, multicast, and broadcast) using `FD_IP4_ADDR` macro and `FD_TEST` assertions to verify their correctness.
    - Log the formatted unicast IP address using `FD_LOG_NOTICE`.
    - Test the multicast and broadcast status of the defined IP addresses using [`fd_ip4_addr_is_mcast`](fd_ip4.h.driver.md#fd_ip4_addr_is_mcast) and [`fd_ip4_addr_is_bcast`](fd_ip4.h.driver.md#fd_ip4_addr_is_bcast) functions with `FD_TEST` assertions.
    - Call [`test_cstr_to_ip4_addr`](#test_cstr_to_ip4_addr) to test string to IP address conversion functionality.
    - Call [`test_ip4_addr_is_public`](#test_ip4_addr_is_public) to test the public/private status of various IP addresses.
    - Log a 'pass' message using `FD_LOG_NOTICE`.
    - Call `fd_halt` to clean up and terminate the program.
- **Output**: Returns 0 to indicate successful execution.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`fd_ip4_addr_is_mcast`](fd_ip4.h.driver.md#fd_ip4_addr_is_mcast)
    - [`fd_ip4_addr_is_bcast`](fd_ip4.h.driver.md#fd_ip4_addr_is_bcast)
