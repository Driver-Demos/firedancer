# Purpose
This C source code file is a comprehensive test suite for Ethernet-related functionalities, specifically focusing on Ethernet header and MAC address operations. It includes static assertions to verify the correctness of various Ethernet constants and structures, such as header types and payload sizes, ensuring that they conform to expected values. The code defines a static Ethernet frame and tests various functions related to MAC address manipulation, including conversion from string to MAC address, checking if a MAC address is multicast, local, broadcast, or IPv4 multicast, and formatting MAC addresses. Additionally, it tests the calculation and verification of the Frame Check Sequence (FCS) for Ethernet frames, ensuring data integrity.

The file serves as an executable test program, as indicated by the presence of a [`main`](#main) function, which orchestrates the execution of various test cases. It leverages utility functions from included headers (`fd_util.h` and `fd_eth.h`) to perform operations on Ethernet headers and MAC addresses. The tests cover a wide range of scenarios, including valid and invalid MAC address strings, and ensure that the Ethernet functionalities behave as expected. This file is crucial for validating the correctness and robustness of Ethernet-related operations in the broader software system, providing a reliable foundation for network communication features.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `../fd_util.h`
- `fd_eth.h`


# Global Variables

---
### frame
- **Type**: `uchar const[]`
- **Description**: The `frame` variable is a static constant array of unsigned characters (bytes) that represents a predefined Ethernet frame. It contains a sequence of hexadecimal values that likely correspond to an Ethernet header and payload, including MAC addresses and possibly an ARP request.
- **Use**: This variable is used to store a predefined Ethernet frame for testing or demonstration purposes, such as verifying frame checksum calculations.


# Functions

---
### test\_cstr\_to\_mac\_addr<!-- {{#callable:test_cstr_to_mac_addr}} -->
The function `test_cstr_to_mac_addr` tests the conversion of C-style string representations of MAC addresses into their binary form and validates the conversion results.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize a 6-byte array `mac` to store the MAC address.
    - Define macros `MAC_OK` and `MAC_FAIL` to test successful and failed conversions respectively.
    - Test valid MAC address strings using `MAC_OK` to ensure they convert correctly to the expected binary form.
    - Iterate over each character position in a valid MAC address string and replace it with invalid characters to test failure cases using `MAC_FAIL`.
    - Test strings with invalid separators and unexpected separators using `MAC_FAIL` to ensure they are correctly identified as invalid.
- **Output**: The function does not return any value; it uses assertions to validate the correctness of the MAC address conversion.


---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function initializes the environment, performs a series of tests on Ethernet MAC addresses and VLAN tags, and validates the functionality of Ethernet frame checksum calculations.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments passed to the program.
    - `argv`: An array of strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Call `fd_boot` to initialize the environment with command-line arguments.
    - Perform static assertions on Ethernet header and VLAN tag structures to ensure correct offsets and sizes.
    - Initialize a source MAC address and perform tests to check if it is multicast, local, broadcast, or IPv4 multicast.
    - Log the formatted MAC address for testing purposes.
    - Convert the source MAC address to an IPv4 multicast MAC address and verify the conversion and properties.
    - Calculate the frame checksum (FCS) for a predefined Ethernet frame and verify it against an expected value.
    - Append to the FCS in parts and verify the final checksum matches the expected value.
    - Initialize a destination MAC address as a broadcast address and verify its properties.
    - Copy the source MAC address to the destination and verify the copy operation.
    - Create a VLAN tag and verify its fields using byte-swapped values.
    - Call [`test_cstr_to_mac_addr`](#test_cstr_to_mac_addr) to test string to MAC address conversion.
    - Log a notice indicating the tests passed and call `fd_halt` to terminate the program.
- **Output**: The function returns 0, indicating successful execution.
