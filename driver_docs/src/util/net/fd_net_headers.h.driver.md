# Purpose
This C header file provides functionality for constructing network headers, specifically Ethernet, IPv4, and UDP headers, in a compact and efficient manner. The file defines a union, `fd_ip4_udp_hdrs`, which encapsulates these three types of headers into a single structure, allowing for easy manipulation and initialization of network packets. The union is designed to handle Ethernet frames with IPv4 and UDP headers, assuming no options are present in the IPv4 header (IHL=5). This setup is particularly useful for applications that need to construct and send network packets with these specific protocols.

The file also includes a static inline function, `fd_ip4_udp_hdr_init`, which initializes the headers with specified source IP and port, and a given payload size. This function sets up the Ethernet, IPv4, and UDP headers, ensuring that fields like checksums are initialized to zero, and that the headers are correctly formatted for network transmission. Additionally, the file defines another union, `fd_ip4_port`, which combines an IP address and port number into a single structure, facilitating operations that require both components. This header file is intended to be included in other C source files, providing a reusable and efficient way to handle network header construction in applications that require low-level network communication.

# Data Structures

### fd\_ip4\_udp\_hdrs
- **Type**: `union`
- **Members**:
    - `uc`: An array of 42 unsigned characters representing the raw bytes of the headers.
    - `eth`: An array of one Ethernet header structure.
    - `ip4`: An array of one IPv4 header structure.
    - `udp`: An array of one UDP header structure.
- **Description**: The `fd_ip4_udp_hdrs` union is designed to facilitate the construction of network headers for Ethernet, IPv4, and UDP protocols. It provides a convenient way to handle these headers as a contiguous block of memory, either as raw bytes or as structured data. The union assumes that the IPv4 header does not include any options, which is indicated by the Internet Header Length (IHL) being set to 5. This data structure is particularly useful for network programming where constructing and manipulating packet headers is required.

### fd\_ip4\_udp\_hdrs\_t
- **Type**: `union`
- **Members**:
    - `uc`: An array of 42 unsigned characters representing the raw bytes of the headers.
    - `eth`: An array of one Ethernet header structure.
    - `ip4`: An array of one IPv4 header structure.
    - `udp`: An array of one UDP header structure.
- **Description**: The `fd_ip4_udp_hdrs_t` is a union designed to facilitate the construction of network headers for Ethernet, IPv4, and UDP protocols. It assumes that the IPv4 header does not include any options, with an Internet Header Length (IHL) of 5. The union provides a raw byte array representation of the headers, as well as structured access to individual Ethernet, IPv4, and UDP header components, allowing for easy manipulation and initialization of these headers in network communication.


---
### fd\_ip4\_port\_t
- **Type**: `union`
- **Members**:
    - `addr`: A 32-bit unsigned integer representing an IPv4 address in network byte order.
    - `port`: A 16-bit unsigned integer representing a port number in network byte order.
    - `l`: A 64-bit unsigned long integer that combines the IPv4 address and port number into a single value.
- **Description**: The `fd_ip4_port_t` is a union data structure that encapsulates an IPv4 address and a port number, providing both individual access to these components and a combined 64-bit representation. This design allows for efficient manipulation and storage of network endpoint information, facilitating operations that require both the address and port to be treated as a single entity.
