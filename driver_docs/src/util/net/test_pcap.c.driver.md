# Purpose
This C source code file is designed to process and manipulate packet capture (PCAP) files, providing functionality for reading, iterating, and optionally writing packet data. The code is structured as an executable program, as indicated by the presence of a [`main`](#main) function, and it is intended to be run in a hosted environment, as suggested by the conditional compilation directive `#if FD_HAS_HOSTED`. The program utilizes functions from the `fd_util` and `fd_pcap` libraries to handle PCAP files, including reading packets from an input stream, iterating over them, and writing them to an output stream if specified. The code also includes static assertions to ensure that certain constants related to PCAP iteration types are correctly defined.

The main functionality of the program involves reading packets from a specified input file or standard input, processing them, and optionally writing them to an output file up to a specified maximum number of packets. The program logs various stages of its execution, such as the source of the input stream and the number of packets processed. Additionally, the code includes a unit test section that verifies the correctness of packet header and payload processing using a simple PCAP file embedded in the binary. This test ensures that the packet iteration and splitting functions work as expected. Overall, the file provides a focused utility for handling PCAP files, with a clear emphasis on reading, processing, and optionally writing packet data.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `../fd_util.h`
- `fd_pcap.h`
- `stdio.h`


# Functions

---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function initializes the environment and logs a notice that the unit test is skipped due to the absence of `FD_HAS_HOSTED`, then halts the program.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The count of command-line arguments passed to the program.
    - `argv`: An array of strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Call `fd_boot` to initialize the environment with the command-line arguments.
    - Log a notice message indicating that the unit test is skipped because `FD_HAS_HOSTED` is not defined.
    - Call `fd_halt` to terminate the program.
    - Return 0 to indicate successful execution.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer value of 0, indicating successful execution.
