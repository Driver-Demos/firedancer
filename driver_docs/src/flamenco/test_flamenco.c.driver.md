# Purpose
This C source code file is an executable program that primarily serves to test the functionality of Base58 encoding on fixed-size byte arrays. The program includes the "fd_flamenco.h" header, suggesting it is part of a larger project or library related to "fd_flamenco." The main function initializes the environment using `fd_boot` and `fd_flamenco_boot`, which are likely setup functions for the library or framework in use. The code defines two static byte arrays, `buf32` and `buf64`, which are 32 and 64 bytes long, respectively. These arrays are used as input for Base58 encoding, a common encoding scheme used to represent binary data in a text format that is more human-readable and less error-prone.

The program uses a formatted string to concatenate the Base58 encoded results of the byte arrays and compares the output against an expected string. The use of macros like `FD_BASE58_ENC_32_ALLOCA` and `FD_BASE58_ENC_64_ALLOCA` indicates that these are likely utility macros for performing Base58 encoding on 32-byte and 64-byte arrays, respectively. The program performs assertions using `FD_TEST` to ensure that the encoded output matches the expected result and that the length of the output is correct. If the tests pass, it logs a "pass" message and gracefully shuts down the environment with `fd_flamenco_halt` and `fd_halt`. This file is a focused test harness for verifying the correctness of Base58 encoding functionality within the context of the "fd_flamenco" project.
# Imports and Dependencies

- `fd_flamenco.h`


# Functions

---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function initializes the environment, encodes data using Base58, formats it into a string, verifies the output, logs success, and then halts the program.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The count of command-line arguments passed to the program.
    - `argv`: An array of strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize the environment by calling `fd_boot` and [`fd_flamenco_boot`](fd_flamenco.c.driver.md#fd_flamenco_boot) with the command-line arguments.
    - Define two static byte arrays `buf32` and `buf64` with predefined values.
    - Define a format string and an expected output string for comparison.
    - Declare a buffer `buf` and a variable `len` to store the formatted output and its length.
    - Use `fd_cstr_printf` to format the Base58 encoded values of `buf32`, `buf64`, and two `NULL` values into `buf`.
    - Verify that the formatted string `buf` matches the `expected` string using `FD_TEST`.
    - Check that the length of the formatted string matches the length of the `expected` string.
    - Log a success message using `FD_LOG_NOTICE`.
    - Call [`fd_flamenco_halt`](fd_flamenco.c.driver.md#fd_flamenco_halt) and `fd_halt` to clean up and terminate the program.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer value `0`, indicating successful execution.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`fd_flamenco_boot`](fd_flamenco.c.driver.md#fd_flamenco_boot)
    - [`fd_flamenco_halt`](fd_flamenco.c.driver.md#fd_flamenco_halt)
