## Files
- **[fd_features.c](features/fd_features.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_features.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase provides functions to enable or disable features based on various criteria, such as enabling all features, disabling all features, enabling features cleaned up by a specific cluster version, and enabling one-off features by decoding their public keys.
- **[fd_features.h](features/fd_features.h.driver.md)**: The `fd_features.h` file in the `firedancer` codebase defines structures and macros for managing feature activation states, including enabling, disabling, and querying features within the Firedancer software.
- **[fd_features_generated.c](features/fd_features_generated.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_features_generated.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase is a generated C source file that defines a list of feature identifiers and provides a function to query these features based on a prefix, with various features being associated with specific offsets in a structure.
- **[fd_features_generated.h](features/fd_features_generated.h.driver.md)**: The `fd_features_generated.h` file is an auto-generated header file that defines a union for managing 234 feature flags within the `firedancer` codebase, specifically for the Flamenco features module.
- **[feature_map.json](features/feature_map.json.driver.md)**: The `feature_map.json` file in the `firedancer` codebase lists various features with their associated public keys and activation statuses across clusters, including details on whether they have been cleaned up or reverted.
- **[gen_features.py](features/gen_features.py.driver.md)**: The `gen_features.py` file in the `firedancer` codebase is a script that auto-generates the `fd_features_generated.h` and `fd_features_generated.c` files from a `feature_map.json` file.
- **[Local.mk](features/Local.mk.driver.md)**: The `Local.mk` file in the `firedancer` codebase specifies header and object files for the `flamenco` features, including `fd_features.h`, `fd_features_generated.h`, `fd_features`, `fd_features_generated`, and `fd_flamenco`.
- **[Makefile](features/Makefile.driver.md)**: The `Makefile` in the `firedancer/src/flamenco/features` directory automates the generation of feature files and formats the Python script using Black.
