# Purpose
This C source code file provides functionality for managing a capture context, specifically for handling memory allocation, initialization, and synchronization related to a capture context object. The primary technical components include functions for creating, joining, leaving, and deleting a capture context ([`fd_capture_ctx_new`](#fd_capture_ctx_new), [`fd_capture_ctx_join`](#fd_capture_ctx_join), [`fd_capture_ctx_leave`](#fd_capture_ctx_leave), and [`fd_capture_ctx_delete`](#fd_capture_ctx_delete)). These functions ensure that the memory is properly aligned and initialized, and they use a magic number to verify the integrity of the context. The code also includes mechanisms for managing read-write locks on transaction status, using functions like [`fd_capture_ctx_txn_status_start_read`](#fd_capture_ctx_txn_status_start_read) and [`fd_capture_ctx_txn_status_end_write`](#fd_capture_ctx_txn_status_end_write), which utilize a static read-write lock (`fd_rwlock_t`) to ensure thread-safe access to shared resources.

The file is designed to be part of a larger system, likely a library, as it defines specific functions for managing capture contexts and transaction status locks, which are common themes throughout the code. It does not define a main function, indicating that it is not an executable but rather a component intended to be integrated into other software. The inclusion of header files and the use of specific macros and types suggest that this code is part of a modular system, providing a narrow but essential functionality related to memory management and synchronization for capture contexts. The use of logging for error conditions and the careful handling of memory alignment and magic numbers highlight the code's focus on robustness and reliability.

- `fd_capture_ctx.h`
- `time.h`
- `../../fd_rwlock.h`


# Global Variables

---
### txn\_status\_lock
- **Type**: `fd_rwlock_t[1]`
- **Description**: `txn_status_lock` is a static array of one `fd_rwlock_t` element, initialized to zero. It is used to manage read-write locks for transaction status operations, ensuring thread-safe access to shared resources.
- **Use**: This variable is used to synchronize access to transaction status data by providing read and write lock mechanisms.


# Functions

---
### fd\_capture\_ctx\_new<!-- {{#callable:fd_capture_ctx_new}} -->
The `fd_capture_ctx_new` function initializes a new capture context in a provided memory block, ensuring alignment and setting up necessary structures.
- **Inputs**:
    - `mem`: A pointer to a memory block where the capture context will be initialized.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if the provided memory pointer `mem` is NULL; if so, log a warning and return NULL.
    - Check if the memory pointer `mem` is aligned according to `FD_CAPTURE_CTX_ALIGN`; if not, log a warning and return NULL.
    - Clear the memory block using `fd_memset` to zero out `FD_CAPTURE_CTX_FOOTPRINT` bytes.
    - Cast the memory block to a `fd_capture_ctx_t` pointer and assign it to `self`.
    - Calculate the address for the `capture` field within the memory block and initialize it using `fd_solcap_writer_new`.
    - Use memory fences (`FD_COMPILER_MFENCE`) to ensure memory operations are completed before setting the `magic` field.
    - Set the `magic` field of the context to `FD_CAPTURE_CTX_MAGIC` to mark it as initialized.
    - Return the original memory pointer `mem`.
- **Output**: Returns the original memory pointer `mem` if initialization is successful, or NULL if there is an error.


---
### fd\_capture\_ctx\_join<!-- {{#callable:fd_capture_ctx_join}} -->
The `fd_capture_ctx_join` function validates and returns a pointer to a `fd_capture_ctx_t` structure if the provided memory block is valid and correctly initialized.
- **Inputs**:
    - `mem`: A pointer to a memory block that is expected to contain a `fd_capture_ctx_t` structure.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if the `mem` pointer is NULL; if so, log a warning and return NULL.
    - Cast the `mem` pointer to a `fd_capture_ctx_t` pointer named `ctx`.
    - Check if the `magic` field of `ctx` matches `FD_CAPTURE_CTX_MAGIC`; if not, log a warning and return NULL.
    - Return the `ctx` pointer.
- **Output**: A pointer to a `fd_capture_ctx_t` structure if the memory block is valid and initialized correctly, otherwise NULL.


---
### fd\_capture\_ctx\_leave<!-- {{#callable:fd_capture_ctx_leave}} -->
The `fd_capture_ctx_leave` function checks the validity of a capture context and returns it if valid, otherwise returns NULL.
- **Inputs**:
    - `ctx`: A pointer to a `fd_capture_ctx_t` structure representing the capture context to be validated and returned.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if the `ctx` pointer is NULL using `FD_UNLIKELY`; if true, log a warning and return NULL.
    - Check if the `magic` field of `ctx` does not match `FD_CAPTURE_CTX_MAGIC` using `FD_UNLIKELY`; if true, log a warning and return NULL.
    - If both checks pass, cast `ctx` to a `void *` and return it.
- **Output**: Returns a `void *` pointer to the `ctx` if it is valid, otherwise returns NULL.


---
### fd\_capture\_ctx\_delete<!-- {{#callable:fd_capture_ctx_delete}} -->
The `fd_capture_ctx_delete` function safely deletes a capture context by validating its memory alignment, magic number, and successfully deleting its associated capture writer.
- **Inputs**:
    - `mem`: A pointer to the memory block representing the capture context to be deleted.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if the `mem` pointer is NULL; if so, log a warning and return NULL.
    - Verify if the `mem` pointer is aligned according to `FD_CAPTURE_CTX_ALIGN`; if not, log a warning and return NULL.
    - Cast `mem` to a `fd_capture_ctx_t` pointer and check if its `magic` field matches `FD_CAPTURE_CTX_MAGIC`; if not, log a warning and return NULL.
    - Attempt to delete the capture writer associated with the context using `fd_solcap_writer_delete`; if it fails, log a warning and return NULL.
    - Use memory fences to ensure memory operations are completed and set the `magic` field to 0 to indicate the context is no longer valid.
    - Return the original `mem` pointer.
- **Output**: Returns the original `mem` pointer if the deletion is successful, otherwise returns NULL if any validation or deletion step fails.

### fd\_capture\_ctx\_txn\_status\_start\_read<!-- {{#callable:fd_capture_ctx_txn_status_start_read}} -->
The function `fd_capture_ctx_txn_status_start_read` acquires a read lock on the transaction status lock to ensure safe concurrent read access.
- **Inputs**: None
