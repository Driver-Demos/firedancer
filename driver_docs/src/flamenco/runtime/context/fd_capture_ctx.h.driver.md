# Purpose
This C header file, `fd_capture_ctx.h`, defines the structure and associated functions for managing a context used in capturing data during the execution of transactions, specifically within a system that appears to involve transaction processing and possibly blockchain or distributed ledger technology. The primary structure defined, `fd_capture_ctx_t`, encapsulates various parameters and settings necessary for capturing transaction data, including solcap (likely a form of data capture related to slots), checkpointing, and protobuf-based data dumping. The structure is aligned to an 8-byte boundary and includes fields for managing solcap capture, checkpoint frequency and paths, and options for dumping data to protobuf formats, which suggests a focus on both real-time data capture and subsequent data analysis or archiving.

The file also declares a set of functions for creating, joining, leaving, and deleting instances of the `fd_capture_ctx_t` structure, indicating that this context is dynamically managed in memory. Additionally, it provides functions for managing read and write locks on transaction status, which are crucial for ensuring data consistency and integrity during concurrent operations. The inclusion of headers such as `fd_solcap_writer.h` and `fd_funk_base.h` suggests dependencies on other components within the system, likely related to data writing and base functionalities. Overall, this header file is part of a broader system, providing a focused API for transaction data capture and management, and is intended to be included and used by other C source files within the same project.

### fd\_capture\_ctx\_new<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_capture_ctx_new}} -->
Initialize a new capture context in the provided memory.
- **Description**: This function initializes a new capture context in the memory provided by the caller. It must be called with a valid memory pointer that is aligned to `FD_CAPTURE_CTX_ALIGN` and has enough space to accommodate the capture context footprint defined by `FD_CAPTURE_CTX_FOOTPRINT`. The function sets up the context for capturing data during transaction execution, including initializing internal structures. If the memory is null or misaligned, the function logs a warning and returns null. This function should be used when setting up a new capture context for transaction processing.
- **Inputs**:
    - `mem`: A pointer to a memory region where the capture context will be initialized. The memory must be aligned to `FD_CAPTURE_CTX_ALIGN` and have a size of at least `FD_CAPTURE_CTX_FOOTPRINT`. The caller retains ownership of the memory. If the pointer is null or the memory is misaligned, the function returns null.
- **Output**: Returns a pointer to the initialized memory if successful, or null if the input memory is null or misaligned.
