# Purpose
This C source code file is designed to test the calculation of the minimum balance required for rent exemption in a system that likely involves some form of resource allocation or financial transactions, such as a blockchain or distributed ledger. The file defines a structure, `fd_rent_exempt_fixture`, which holds input parameters like `data_len`, `lamports_per_byte_year`, and an exemption threshold, as well as an expected output, `min_balance`. The code includes a static array, `test_rent_exempt_vector`, which contains multiple test cases with predefined input values and expected results. The main function iterates over these test cases, calculates the minimum balance using the `fd_rent_exempt_minimum_balance` function, and verifies the result against the expected `min_balance` using the `FD_TEST` macro.

The file serves as a test suite for validating the correctness of the rent exemption calculation logic. It is structured as an executable C program, with a [`main`](#main) function that initializes the test environment, runs the tests, and logs the results. The code is focused on a specific functionalityâ€”ensuring that the rent exemption calculations are accurate based on various input scenarios. It does not define public APIs or external interfaces but rather uses internal structures and functions to perform its testing tasks. The inclusion of `fd_sysvar_rent.h` suggests that the actual calculation logic and related definitions are provided by this header, which is likely part of a larger library or system.
# Imports and Dependencies

# Global Variables

---
### test\_rent\_exempt\_vector
- **Type**: `fd_rent_exempt_fixture_t const[]`
- **Description**: The `test_rent_exempt_vector` is a static array of `fd_rent_exempt_fixture_t` structures, each containing test data for rent exemption calculations. Each element in the array specifies a combination of data length, lamports per byte per year, exemption threshold bits, and the expected minimum balance required for rent exemption. This array is used to validate the rent exemption logic by comparing calculated minimum balances against expected values.
- **Use**: This variable is used in a loop to iterate over each test case, applying rent exemption calculations and verifying the results against expected minimum balances.


# Data Structures

---
### fd\_rent\_exempt\_fixture
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `data_len`: Represents the length of the data in bytes.
    - `lamports_per_byte_year`: Indicates the cost in lamports per byte per year.
    - `exemption_threshold`: A double value representing the threshold for rent exemption.
    - `exemption_threshold_bits`: An unsigned long integer representing the threshold for rent exemption in bits.
    - `min_balance`: The minimum balance required to be rent exempt.
- **Description**: The `fd_rent_exempt_fixture` structure is designed to model the parameters and results related to rent exemption calculations in a blockchain context. It includes input fields such as `data_len` for the size of the data, `lamports_per_byte_year` for the cost of storing data, and a union for the exemption threshold, which can be represented either as a double or as bits. The output field `min_balance` represents the calculated minimum balance required to achieve rent exemption. This structure is used in conjunction with rent calculation functions to verify that the computed minimum balance matches expected values.

### fd\_rent\_exempt\_fixture\_t
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `data_len`: Represents the length of the data in bytes.
    - `lamports_per_byte_year`: Indicates the number of lamports charged per byte per year.
    - `exemption_threshold`: A union member representing the exemption threshold as a double.
    - `exemption_threshold_bits`: A union member representing the exemption threshold as an unsigned long integer.
    - `min_balance`: Specifies the minimum balance required for rent exemption.
- **Description**: The `fd_rent_exempt_fixture_t` structure is designed to encapsulate the parameters and results related to rent exemption calculations in a blockchain context. It includes input fields such as `data_len` and `lamports_per_byte_year` to define the data size and cost per byte per year, respectively. The structure also contains a union for the exemption threshold, allowing it to be represented either as a double or as bits. The `min_balance` field is used to store the calculated minimum balance required to achieve rent exemption. This structure is utilized in testing scenarios to verify the correctness of rent exemption calculations.


# Functions

---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function initializes the system, iterates over a set of rent exemption test cases, calculates the minimum balance for each case, and verifies the result against expected values.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments.
    - `argv`: An array of strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Call `fd_boot` to initialize the system with command-line arguments.
    - Initialize an iterator `iter` to traverse the `test_rent_exempt_vector`.
    - For each element in `test_rent_exempt_vector`, create a `fd_rent_t` structure with values from the current test case.
    - Calculate the minimum balance using [`fd_rent_exempt_minimum_balance`](fd_sysvar_rent1.c.driver.md#fd_rent_exempt_minimum_balance) with the current rent structure and data length.
    - Use `FD_TEST` to assert that the calculated minimum balance matches the expected minimum balance from the test case.
    - Log a notice message indicating success if all tests pass.
    - Call `fd_halt` to terminate the program.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer value `0` indicating successful execution.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`fd_rent_exempt_minimum_balance`](fd_sysvar_rent1.c.driver.md#fd_rent_exempt_minimum_balance)
