# Purpose
This C source code file defines a function to calculate the minimum balance required for rent exemption in a blockchain context, specifically for Solana's rent model. The function [`fd_rent_exempt_minimum_balance`](#fd_rent_exempt_minimum_balance) takes a pointer to a `fd_rent_t` structure and a data length, then computes the minimum balance by considering the data length, a defined storage overhead, and rent parameters such as `lamports_per_uint8_year` and `exemption_threshold`. The code includes references to external resources, indicating its alignment with Solana's rent calculation logic, and it uses a helper function `fd_rust_cast_double_to_ulong` to handle type conversion. The file is designed to minimize dependencies on other components, particularly `fd_funk`, by isolating this functionality into a separate compilation unit.

### fd\_rent\_exempt\_minimum\_balance<!-- {{#callable:fd_rent_exempt_minimum_balance}} -->
The function `fd_rent_exempt_minimum_balance` calculates the minimum balance required to be rent-exempt for a given data length in a Solana account.
- **Inputs**:
    - `rent`: A pointer to an `fd_rent_t` structure containing rent-related parameters such as `lamports_per_uint8_year` and `exemption_threshold`.
    - `data_len`: An unsigned long integer representing the length of the data for which the rent-exempt minimum balance is being calculated.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function adds a constant `ACCOUNT_STORAGE_OVERHEAD` to the `data_len` to account for additional storage overhead.
    - It multiplies the sum by `rent->lamports_per_uint8_year` to calculate the annual rent in lamports for the data length including overhead.
    - The result is then multiplied by `rent->exemption_threshold` to determine the rent-exempt threshold.
    - The final result is cast from a double to an unsigned long using `fd_rust_cast_double_to_ulong` and returned.
- **Output**: The function returns an unsigned long integer representing the minimum balance in lamports required to make the account rent-exempt for the specified data length.
