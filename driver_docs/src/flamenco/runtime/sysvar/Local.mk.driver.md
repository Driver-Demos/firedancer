# Purpose
The provided content is a Makefile script used in a software build system to manage the compilation and testing of various components related to system variables, denoted by the prefix `fd_sysvar`. The script uses conditional directives, such as `ifdef FD_HAS_INT128` and `ifdef FD_HAS_HOSTED`, to include specific headers and object files only if certain conditions are met, indicating a flexible build process that adapts to different environments or configurations. The `add-hdrs` and `add-objs` functions are invoked to include header files and compile object files, respectively, for various system variable modules like `fd_sysvar_clock`, `fd_sysvar_epoch_rewards`, and others. Additionally, the script includes unit test creation and execution commands for certain modules, such as `test_sysvar_epoch_schedule` and `test_sysvar_rent`, when the `FD_HAS_HOSTED` condition is satisfied, ensuring that these components are tested in a hosted environment. This Makefile facilitates organized and conditional compilation and testing of system variable-related components within the codebase.
