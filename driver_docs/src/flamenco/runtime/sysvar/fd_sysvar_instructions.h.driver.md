# Purpose
This code is a C header file that defines function prototypes for operations related to system variables in a runtime environment, specifically within the "flamenco" module. It includes necessary dependencies from other header files, such as base definitions and instruction information, to facilitate its operations. The file declares two functions: [`fd_sysvar_instructions_serialize_account`](#fd_sysvar_instructions_serialize_account), which is likely responsible for serializing account-related data within a transaction context, and [`fd_sysvar_instructions_update_current_instr_idx`](#fd_sysvar_instructions_update_current_instr_idx), which updates the current instruction index in a transaction account. The use of include guards ensures that the header file is only included once during compilation, preventing potential redefinition errors.

# Function Declarations (Public API)

### fd\_sysvar\_instructions\_serialize\_account<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_sysvar_instructions_serialize_account}} -->
Serializes instruction data into a transaction account.
- **Description**: Use this function to serialize a list of instructions into a specific transaction account within the provided transaction context. This function should be called only after the transaction context has been properly initialized and the necessary accounts have been set up. It assumes that the sysvar instructions account is already included in the borrowed accounts list of the transaction context. The function prepares the account to store serialized instruction data, setting various account properties to default values before serialization. It is important to ensure that the number of instructions does not exceed the capacity of the account's data storage.
- **Inputs**:
    - `txn_ctx`: A pointer to a transaction context structure. Must not be null and should be properly initialized with the necessary accounts set up.
    - `instrs`: A pointer to an array of instruction information structures. Must not be null and should point to a valid array of instructions to be serialized.
    - `instrs_cnt`: The number of instructions in the 'instrs' array. Must be a non-negative value and should not exceed the maximum capacity of the account's data storage.
- **Output**: None
- **See also**: [`fd_sysvar_instructions_serialize_account`](fd_sysvar_instructions.c.driver.md#fd_sysvar_instructions_serialize_account)  (Implementation)

### fd\_sysvar\_instructions\_update\_current\_instr\_idx<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_sysvar_instructions_update_current_instr_idx}} -->
Updates the current instruction index in a transaction account.
- **Description**: This function updates the current instruction index within a transaction account record. It should be used when there is a need to modify the instruction index to reflect the current state of processing within a transaction. The function expects the transaction account to have sufficient space to store the index, and it will not perform the update if the space is inadequate. This function must be called with a valid transaction account that has been properly initialized and is capable of storing at least a ushort value.
- **Inputs**:
    - `rec`: A pointer to a transaction account structure where the current instruction index will be updated. Must not be null and must point to a valid, initialized transaction account with sufficient space to store a ushort value.
    - `current_instr_idx`: The current instruction index to be stored in the transaction account. It is a ushort value representing the index of the current instruction.
- **Output**: None
- **See also**: [`fd_sysvar_instructions_update_current_instr_idx`](fd_sysvar_instructions.c.driver.md#fd_sysvar_instructions_update_current_instr_idx)  (Implementation)
