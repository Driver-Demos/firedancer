## Files
- **[fd_capture_ctx.c](context/fd_capture_ctx.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_capture_ctx.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase implements functions for managing a capture context, including creation, joining, leaving, and deletion, as well as functions for handling transaction status read/write locks.
- **[fd_capture_ctx.h](context/fd_capture_ctx.h.driver.md)**: The `fd_capture_ctx.h` file defines the structure and functions for managing the context needed for solcap capture during transaction execution in the Firedancer project.
- **[fd_exec_epoch_ctx.c](context/fd_exec_epoch_ctx.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_exec_epoch_ctx.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase implements functions for managing the execution context of an epoch, including memory alignment, footprint calculation, creation, joining, leaving, and deletion of the context, as well as setting up and clearing bank memory.
- **[fd_exec_epoch_ctx.h](context/fd_exec_epoch_ctx.h.driver.md)**: The `fd_exec_epoch_ctx.h` file defines the structure and functions for managing the execution context that remains constant throughout an entire epoch in the Firedancer runtime.
- **[fd_exec_instr_ctx.c](context/fd_exec_instr_ctx.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_exec_instr_ctx.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase implements functions for managing and interacting with execution instruction contexts, including creating, joining, leaving, and deleting contexts, as well as handling account borrowing and signer verification.
- **[fd_exec_instr_ctx.h](context/fd_exec_instr_ctx.h.driver.md)**: The `fd_exec_instr_ctx.h` file defines the structure and functions for managing the execution context of a single instruction within the Firedancer runtime, including operations for handling accounts and program identifiers.
- **[fd_exec_slot_ctx.c](context/fd_exec_slot_ctx.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_exec_slot_ctx.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase provides functions for managing execution slot contexts, including creation, joining, leaving, deletion, and recovery of slot contexts, as well as synchronization of PoH/wallclock and status cache recovery.
- **[fd_exec_slot_ctx.h](context/fd_exec_slot_ctx.h.driver.md)**: The `fd_exec_slot_ctx.h` file defines the `fd_exec_slot_ctx_t` structure and associated functions for managing the execution context that remains constant during all transactions in a block within the Firedancer runtime.
- **[fd_exec_txn_ctx.c](context/fd_exec_txn_ctx.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_exec_txn_ctx.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase implements functions for managing transaction execution contexts, including creating, joining, leaving, and deleting contexts, as well as handling account retrieval and validation within those contexts.
- **[fd_exec_txn_ctx.h](context/fd_exec_txn_ctx.h.driver.md)**: The `fd_exec_txn_ctx.h` file in the `firedancer` codebase defines the structures and functions necessary for managing the execution context of a transaction, including account handling, instruction tracing, and error management.
- **[Local.mk](context/Local.mk.driver.md)**: The `Local.mk` file in the `firedancer` codebase is a makefile that conditionally adds headers and object files related to execution and capture contexts if `FD_HAS_INT128` is defined.
