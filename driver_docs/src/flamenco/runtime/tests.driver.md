- **[Local.mk](tests/Local.mk.driver.md)**: The `Local.mk` file in the `firedancer` codebase defines build rules and test execution commands for the Flamenco runtime tests, including the addition of headers and objects, and the setup for running various runtime and backtest scripts.
- **[Makefile](tests/Makefile.driver.md)**: The `Makefile` in the `firedancer` codebase defines a target `all` that runs a script called `fetch_and_generate.sh`.
- **[nightly_runner.sh](tests/nightly_runner.sh.driver.md)**: The `nightly_runner.sh` file is a Bash script that automates the process of updating the codebase, setting up the environment, building the project, and running nightly tests for the `firedancer` project.
- **[run_backtest_ci.sh](tests/run_backtest_ci.sh.driver.md)**: The `run_backtest_ci.sh` file is a shell script in the `firedancer` codebase that executes a series of ledger backtests across different network environments using specified snapshots and configurations.
- **[run_backtest_tests_all.sh](tests/run_backtest_tests_all.sh.driver.md)**: The `run_backtest_tests_all.sh` file in the `firedancer` codebase is a shell script that executes a series of ledger backtests using various snapshots and configurations.
- **[run_conformance_tests.sh](tests/run_conformance_tests.sh.driver.md)**: The `run_conformance_tests.sh` file is a script used to execute the Solana conformance test suite by setting up necessary dependencies and running tests with specified input and output directories.
- **[run_ledger_backtest.sh](tests/run_ledger_backtest.sh.driver.md)**: The `run_ledger_backtest.sh` file is a shell script in the `firedancer` codebase that sets up and executes a backtest for a specified ledger, handling configuration, downloading necessary resources, and logging the process.
- **[run_ledger_test.sh](tests/run_ledger_test.sh.driver.md)**: The `run_ledger_test.sh` file is a Bash script used in the `firedancer` codebase to configure and execute a ledger test, including downloading necessary resources, setting up the environment, and running the test with various options.
- **[run_ledger_tests_all.py](tests/run_ledger_tests_all.py.driver.md)**: The `run_ledger_tests_all.py` file in the `firedancer` codebase is a Python script that manages the execution of commands from a file using multiprocessing, distributing tasks across CPU batches and handling errors.
- **[run_ledger_tests_all.txt](tests/run_ledger_tests_all.txt.driver.md)**: The `run_ledger_tests_all.txt` file in the `firedancer` codebase contains a series of commands to execute ledger tests using different configurations and snapshots.
- **[run_nightly_backtest.sh](tests/run_nightly_backtest.sh.driver.md)**: The `run_nightly_backtest.sh` file is a Bash script used in the `firedancer` codebase to configure and execute a nightly backtest of a ledger, sending status updates to Slack and handling memory page allocation.
- **[run_nightly_test.sh](tests/run_nightly_test.sh.driver.md)**: The `run_nightly_test.sh` file is a Bash script used in the `firedancer` codebase to execute nightly tests on a ledger, configure memory pages, and send status updates to a Slack channel.
- **[test_exec_sol_compat.c](tests/test_exec_sol_compat.c.driver.md)**: The `test_exec_sol_compat.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase implements a test runner for executing various compatibility tests on Solana-related components, such as instruction, transaction, ELF loader, syscall, VM interpreter, and block fixtures, while ensuring proper resource management and logging results.
