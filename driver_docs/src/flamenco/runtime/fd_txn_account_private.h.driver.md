# Purpose
This C header file defines a structure, `fd_txn_account_private_state`, which is used to manage the state of a transaction account in a private context within the Flamenco runtime system. The structure includes pointers to constant and mutable metadata, data, and record types, as well as global address identifiers for metadata and data. It also includes a reference count (`refcnt_excl`) to manage borrowing semantics, indicating that it is intended for single-threaded use and does not function as a synchronization mechanism. The file includes necessary dependencies from other parts of the Flamenco system, specifically types and record definitions, suggesting its role in handling transaction account states with both read-only and mutable access.

# Data Structures

---
### fd\_txn\_account\_private\_state
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `const_meta`: A constant pointer to account metadata.
    - `const_data`: A constant pointer to account data.
    - `const_rec`: A constant pointer to a funk record.
    - `meta`: A pointer to account metadata.
    - `data`: A pointer to account data.
    - `rec`: A pointer to a funk record.
    - `meta_gaddr`: A global address for account metadata.
    - `data_gaddr`: A global address for account data.
    - `refcnt_excl`: A reference count for exclusive access, used for single-threaded logic.
- **Description**: The `fd_txn_account_private_state` structure is designed to manage the state of a transaction account in a private context, providing both constant and mutable pointers to account metadata, data, and funk records. It includes global addresses for metadata and data, and a reference count for exclusive access, which is intended for single-threaded operations and not for data synchronization purposes. The structure is aligned to 8 bytes for efficient memory access.

### fd\_txn\_account\_private\_state\_t
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `const_meta`: A constant pointer to an fd_account_meta_t structure.
    - `const_data`: A constant pointer to an unsigned character array.
    - `const_rec`: A constant pointer to an fd_funk_rec_t structure.
    - `meta`: A pointer to an fd_account_meta_t structure.
    - `data`: A pointer to an unsigned character array.
    - `rec`: A pointer to an fd_funk_rec_t structure.
    - `meta_gaddr`: An unsigned long representing the global address of the meta data.
    - `data_gaddr`: An unsigned long representing the global address of the data.
    - `refcnt_excl`: A ushort used for borrowing semantics, indicating exclusive reference count.
- **Description**: The `fd_txn_account_private_state_t` structure is designed to manage the private state of a transaction account, providing both constant and mutable pointers to account metadata, data, and record structures. It includes global addresses for metadata and data, and a reference count for exclusive access, facilitating borrowing semantics in single-threaded logic without acting as a synchronization lock.
