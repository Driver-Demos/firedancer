# Purpose
This C source code file is designed to test transaction conflict detection in a blockchain or distributed ledger system. It includes a series of functions that simulate various transaction scenarios to verify the system's ability to detect read-write and write-write conflicts among transactions. The code imports several header files that provide utility functions, base definitions, and runtime error handling, indicating that it is part of a larger software system. The file defines several test functions, such as [`test_no_conflict`](#test_no_conflict), [`test_write_write_conflict`](#test_write_write_conflict), and [`test_read_write_conflict_alt`](#test_read_write_conflict_alt), each of which sets up specific transaction scenarios and checks for conflicts using the `fd_runtime_microblock_verify_read_write_conflicts` function. These tests ensure that the system correctly identifies when transactions can be executed concurrently without conflicts and when they cannot due to overlapping account usage.

The code also includes functions for parsing transactions and adding address lookup tables, which are used to manage account addresses involved in transactions. The [`add_address_lookup_table`](#add_address_lookup_table) function, for example, appends an address lookup table to a transaction payload, demonstrating the system's capability to handle complex transaction structures. The main function initializes the necessary data structures and memory allocations for the tests, such as the account map and transaction map, and then executes the test functions to validate the conflict detection logic. This file is a critical component of the system's testing suite, ensuring the robustness and reliability of transaction processing in a concurrent environment.
