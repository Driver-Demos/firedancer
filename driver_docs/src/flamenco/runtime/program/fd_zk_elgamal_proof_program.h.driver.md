# Purpose
This C header file defines a set of constants and a function prototype for a Zero-Knowledge (ZK) ElGamal Proof Program, which is part of a larger cryptographic framework. The file includes definitions for various instruction identifiers and their corresponding compute units, which are used to execute specific cryptographic proofs related to ElGamal encryption, such as verifying ciphertext equality, public key validity, and range proofs. These instructions are likely part of a zero-knowledge proof system, which allows one party to prove to another that a statement is true without revealing any information beyond the validity of the statement itself. The header also includes a function prototype for executing these instructions within a given execution context, indicating its role in facilitating the integration of these cryptographic operations into a broader application.

### fd\_executor\_zk\_elgamal\_proof\_program\_execute<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_executor_zk_elgamal_proof_program_execute}} -->
Executes a ZK ElGamal proof program instruction.
- **Description**: This function executes a specified instruction within the ZK ElGamal proof program, based on the instruction data provided in the context. It should be called when a valid instruction needs to be processed, and the program feature is active. The function handles various instruction types, updating compute units and logging messages as necessary. It returns specific error codes if the program is not supported or if the instruction data is invalid.
- **Inputs**:
    - `ctx`: A pointer to an fd_exec_instr_ctx_t structure containing the execution context, including transaction context and instruction data. Must not be null, and the context must be properly initialized with valid instruction data.
- **Output**: Returns an integer status code indicating success or specific error conditions, such as unsupported program ID or invalid instruction data.
- **See also**: [`fd_executor_zk_elgamal_proof_program_execute`](fd_zk_elgamal_proof_program.c.driver.md#fd_executor_zk_elgamal_proof_program_execute)  (Implementation)
