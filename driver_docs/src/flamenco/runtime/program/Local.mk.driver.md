# Purpose
The provided content is from a Makefile, which is a build automation tool used to manage the build process of software projects. This specific section of the Makefile is conditionally executed if the macro `FD_HAS_INT128` is defined, indicating that the build process should include support for 128-bit integer operations. The file uses a series of `$(call add-hdrs,...)` and `$(call add-objs,...)` commands to add header files and object files to the build process, respectively. These commands are organized into categories such as "Reusable," "Precompiles," and "Native programs," each listing specific components like `fd_builtin_programs.h` and `fd_address_lookup_table_program.h`. The purpose of this configuration is to ensure that the necessary headers and object files are included in the build, facilitating the compilation and linking of various program modules, particularly those related to BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter) and native programs within the software project.
