# Purpose
This C header file defines structures and function prototypes for a cryptographic component, specifically a transcript system using the STROBE protocol, which is part of the Merlin protocol suite. The file includes the definition of two structures: `fd_merlin_strobe128`, which encapsulates the state of the STROBE protocol, and `fd_merlin_transcript`, which uses the former to manage cryptographic transcripts. It provides function prototypes for initializing a transcript, appending messages and 64-bit unsigned integers to the transcript, and generating challenge bytes, which are essential operations in cryptographic protocols for ensuring data integrity and authenticity. The use of macros and typedefs enhances code readability and maintainability, while the inclusion of a base header file suggests integration with a larger cryptographic framework.

### fd\_merlin\_transcript\_init<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_merlin_transcript_init}} -->
Initialize a Merlin transcript with a domain separation label.
- **Description**: This function initializes a Merlin transcript context, preparing it for use in cryptographic protocols. It must be called before any other operations on the transcript. The function sets up the internal state of the transcript and appends a domain separation label to it, which is used to distinguish different contexts or protocol runs. This label helps ensure that transcripts are unique and non-interfering across different uses.
- **Inputs**:
    - `mctx`: A pointer to an fd_merlin_transcript_t structure that will be initialized. Must not be null, and the caller retains ownership.
    - `label`: A pointer to a constant character string representing the domain separation label. Must not be null, and the caller retains ownership.
    - `label_len`: The length of the label string. Must accurately represent the length of the label provided.
- **Output**: None
- **See also**: [`fd_merlin_transcript_init`](fd_merlin.c.driver.md#fd_merlin_transcript_init)  (Implementation)

### fd\_merlin\_transcript\_append\_message<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_merlin_transcript_append_message}} -->
Appends a labeled message to the transcript.
- **Description**: Use this function to add a message to an existing transcript, associating it with a specific label. This is typically done as part of a cryptographic protocol where maintaining a sequence of operations is crucial. The function must be called with a valid and initialized `fd_merlin_transcript_t` object. The label and message are processed and incorporated into the transcript, which may affect subsequent operations that depend on the transcript's state.
- **Inputs**:
    - `mctx`: A pointer to an `fd_merlin_transcript_t` structure that must be initialized before calling this function. The transcript is updated with the new message.
    - `label`: A pointer to a constant character string representing the label for the message. The label must not be null and should be of length `label_len`.
    - `label_len`: The length of the label in bytes. It must accurately reflect the length of the string pointed to by `label`.
    - `message`: A pointer to the message data to be appended. The message must not be null and should be of length `message_len`.
    - `message_len`: The length of the message in bytes. It must accurately reflect the length of the data pointed to by `message`.

### fd\_merlin\_transcript\_challenge\_bytes<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_merlin_transcript_challenge_bytes}} -->
Generates a challenge byte sequence in the transcript.
- **Description**: This function is used to generate a sequence of challenge bytes within a given transcript context. It should be called when a challenge needs to be derived from the current state of the transcript. The function requires a label to identify the challenge and a buffer to store the generated bytes. The transcript context must be properly initialized before calling this function. The function modifies the buffer to contain the challenge bytes, and the length of the buffer determines how many bytes are generated.
- **Inputs**:
    - `mctx`: A pointer to an initialized fd_merlin_transcript_t structure. The transcript context must be valid and initialized before calling this function. The function updates the internal state of this context.
    - `label`: A pointer to a constant character string that serves as a label for the challenge. The label must not be null and should be a valid string with a length specified by label_len.
    - `label_len`: The length of the label string. It must accurately reflect the number of characters in the label, excluding any null terminator.
    - `buffer`: A pointer to a buffer where the generated challenge bytes will be stored. The buffer must be large enough to hold buffer_len bytes, and the caller is responsible for managing its memory.
    - `buffer_len`: The number of bytes to generate and store in the buffer. It determines the size of the challenge byte sequence.
- **Output**: The function writes the generated challenge bytes into the provided buffer.
