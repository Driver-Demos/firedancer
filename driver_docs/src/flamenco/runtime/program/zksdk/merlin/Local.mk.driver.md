# Purpose
The file is a Makefile snippet used in a build system to manage dependencies and automate the compilation process. It adds the header file `fd_merlin.h` and object files `fd_merlin` and `fd_flamenco` to the build. Additionally, it defines a unit test target `test_merlin` that depends on the `fd_flamenco`, `fd_ballet`, and `fd_util` components.
