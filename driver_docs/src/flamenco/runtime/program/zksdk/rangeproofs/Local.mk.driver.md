# Purpose
The file is a Makefile snippet used in a build system to manage dependencies and compilation targets. It utilizes a macro or function `add-hdrs` to include the header file `fd_rangeproofs.h` and `add-objs` to specify object files `fd_rangeproofs` and `fd_flamenco` for compilation. This setup helps automate the process of compiling and linking the specified components in the project.
