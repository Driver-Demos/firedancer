# Purpose
This C source code file is part of a cryptographic library, specifically dealing with the verification of range proofs in a zero-knowledge proof system. The file defines two functions: [`fd_zksdk_verify_proof_range_u128`](#fd_zksdk_verify_proof_range_u128) and [`fd_zksdk_instr_verify_proof_batched_range_proof_u128`](#fd_zksdk_instr_verify_proof_batched_range_proof_u128). The primary purpose of these functions is to verify that a given proof, which asserts that a secret value lies within a certain range, is valid without revealing the actual value. The [`fd_zksdk_verify_proof_range_u128`](#fd_zksdk_verify_proof_range_u128) function performs the core verification logic by utilizing an inner product proof (`ipp_proof`) and a range proof, while the [`fd_zksdk_instr_verify_proof_batched_range_proof_u128`](#fd_zksdk_instr_verify_proof_batched_range_proof_u128) function initializes the verification context and calls the former function to perform the actual verification.

The code is designed to be part of a larger cryptographic framework, likely intended to be used as a library rather than a standalone executable. It interfaces with other components through the use of specific data structures and constants, such as `fd_zksdk_range_proof_u128_proof_t`, `fd_zksdk_transcript_t`, and various macros like `FD_LIKELY` and `FD_UNLIKELY` for performance optimization. The functions are not public APIs but are likely intended for internal use within the library, as suggested by the use of static inline for [`fd_zksdk_verify_proof_range_u128`](#fd_zksdk_verify_proof_range_u128), which limits its visibility to the file scope. The code also references external resources, indicating integration with other parts of the system, such as the GitHub repository links provided in the comments.

# Functions

### fd\_zksdk\_verify\_proof\_range\_u128<!-- {{#callable:fd_zksdk_verify_proof_range_u128}} -->
The function `fd_zksdk_verify_proof_range_u128` verifies a range proof for a 128-bit unsigned integer using a given proof, commitments, bit lengths, and a transcript.
- **Inputs**:
    - `proof`: A pointer to a `fd_zksdk_range_proof_u128_proof_t` structure containing the range proof data to be verified.
    - `commitments`: An array of 32 unsigned characters representing the commitments associated with the proof.
    - `bit_lengths`: An array of 1 unsigned character representing the bit lengths of the values involved in the proof.
    - `batch_len`: An unsigned character representing the length of the batch for the proof verification.
    - `transcript`: A pointer to a `fd_zksdk_transcript_t` structure used to maintain the state of the proof verification process.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize a `fd_rangeproofs_ipp_proof_t` structure `ipp_proof` with specific values from the `proof` parameter.
    - Call the `fd_rangeproofs_verify` function with the range proof, `ipp_proof`, commitments, bit lengths, batch length, and transcript to perform the verification.
    - Check if the result of the verification (`res`) is equal to `FD_RANGEPROOFS_SUCCESS`.
    - If the verification is successful, return `FD_EXECUTOR_INSTR_SUCCESS`.
    - If the verification fails, return `FD_ZKSDK_VERIFY_PROOF_ERROR`.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer indicating the success or failure of the proof verification, specifically `FD_EXECUTOR_INSTR_SUCCESS` on success or `FD_ZKSDK_VERIFY_PROOF_ERROR` on failure.

### fd\_zksdk\_instr\_verify\_proof\_batched\_range\_proof\_u128<!-- {{#callable:fd_zksdk_instr_verify_proof_batched_range_proof_u128}} -->
The function `fd_zksdk_instr_verify_proof_batched_range_proof_u128` verifies a batched range proof for 128-bit unsigned integers using a given context and proof data.
- **Inputs**:
    - `_context`: A pointer to a `fd_zksdk_batched_range_proof_context_t` structure containing the context for the batched range proof verification.
    - `_proof`: A pointer to a `fd_zksdk_range_proof_u128_proof_t` structure containing the proof data to be verified.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize a transcript and cast the input pointers to their respective types for context and proof.
    - Initialize a `batch_len` variable to zero.
    - Call `batched_range_proof_init_and_validate` to initialize and validate the batch length and transcript using the context; if this function does not return `FD_EXECUTOR_INSTR_SUCCESS`, return the error code immediately.
    - If the initialization and validation are successful, call [`fd_zksdk_verify_proof_range_u128`](#fd_zksdk_verify_proof_range_u128) with the proof, context commitments, bit lengths, batch length, and transcript to perform the actual verification of the range proof.
    - Return the result of the verification function.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer status code, which is `FD_EXECUTOR_INSTR_SUCCESS` if the verification is successful, or an error code if it fails.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`fd_zksdk_verify_proof_range_u128`](#fd_zksdk_verify_proof_range_u128)
