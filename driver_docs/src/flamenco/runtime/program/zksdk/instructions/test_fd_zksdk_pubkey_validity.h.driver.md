# Purpose
This C header file, `test_fd_zksdk_pubkey_validity.h`, is part of a test suite for verifying the validity of public keys, likely within a zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) system. It includes an array of strings, `tx_pubkey_validity`, which appears to contain hexadecimal representations of public keys, transaction data, or related cryptographic proofs. The file also defines a constant, `instr_offset_pubkey_validity`, which might be used as an offset or index in the context of processing or validating these keys. The inclusion of a private header file, `fd_zksdk_private.h`, suggests that this file is part of a larger framework or library dealing with cryptographic operations, specifically focusing on the validity of public keys in transactions. The presence of a "TODO" comment indicates that the implementation is still under development or requires further refinement.
# Imports and Dependencies

- `../fd_zksdk_private.h`


# Global Variables

---
### tx\_pubkey\_validity
- **Type**: `char*[]`
- **Description**: The `tx_pubkey_validity` is a static array of strings, each representing a hexadecimal value or identifier related to public key validity checks. The array includes various cryptographic elements such as proofs, contexts, and identifiers that are likely used in the process of verifying the validity of a public key in a zero-knowledge proof system.
- **Use**: This variable is used to store a sequence of cryptographic data elements necessary for verifying public key validity.


---
### instr\_offset\_pubkey\_validity
- **Type**: `ulong`
- **Description**: The `instr_offset_pubkey_validity` is a constant unsigned long integer that holds the value 351. It is defined as a global variable, making it accessible throughout the file or program where it is included.
- **Use**: This variable is used to represent a specific offset value related to public key validity instructions, likely serving as an index or position marker in a larger data structure or process.
