# Purpose
This code is a C header file that defines data structures for handling cryptographic proofs and contexts related to ciphertext equality. It includes the `fd_flamenco_base.h` header, suggesting it is part of a larger cryptographic library or framework. The file defines two packed structures: `fd_zksdk_ciph_ciph_eq_proof`, which holds cryptographic proof data with fields for points and scalars, and `fd_zksdk_ciph_ciph_eq_context`, which contains public keys and ciphertexts, each represented as arrays of unsigned characters. These structures are likely used in zero-knowledge proofs or cryptographic protocols to verify the equality of ciphertexts without revealing the underlying data.

### fd\_zksdk\_ciph\_ciph\_eq\_proof
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `y0`: An array of 32 unsigned characters representing a point.
    - `y1`: An array of 32 unsigned characters representing a point.
    - `y2`: An array of 32 unsigned characters representing a point.
    - `y3`: An array of 32 unsigned characters representing a point.
    - `zs`: An array of 32 unsigned characters representing a scalar.
    - `zx`: An array of 32 unsigned characters representing a scalar.
    - `zr`: An array of 32 unsigned characters representing a scalar.
- **Description**: The `fd_zksdk_ciph_ciph_eq_proof` structure is a packed data structure used in zero-knowledge proofs for ciphertext equality, containing four 32-byte arrays representing points and three 32-byte arrays representing scalars. This structure is likely used to store proof data that demonstrates the equality of two ciphertexts without revealing the underlying plaintexts, leveraging cryptographic points and scalars.

    - `y1`: A 32-byte array representing a point.
    - `y2`: A 32-byte array representing a point.
    - `y3`: A 32-byte array representing a point.
    - `zs`: A 32-byte array representing a scalar.

- **Description**: The `fd_zksdk_ciph_ciph_eq_proof_t` structure is a packed data structure used to represent a proof of equality between ciphertexts in a zero-knowledge setting. It contains four 32-byte arrays (`y0`, `y1`, `y2`, `y3`) that represent points, and three 32-byte arrays (`zs`, `zx`, `zr`) that represent scalars. This structure is likely used in cryptographic protocols to verify that two ciphertexts encrypt the same plaintext without revealing the plaintext itself.

### fd\_zksdk\_ciph\_ciph\_eq\_context
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `pubkey1`: An array of 32 unsigned characters representing a public key point.
    - `pubkey2`: An array of 32 unsigned characters representing another public key point.
    - `ciphertext1`: An array of 64 unsigned characters representing two points of ciphertext.
    - `ciphertext2`: An array of 64 unsigned characters representing another two points of ciphertext.
- **Description**: The `fd_zksdk_ciph_ciph_eq_context` structure is a packed data structure used to store cryptographic context information for ciphertext equality operations. It contains two public key points and two ciphertexts, each represented as arrays of unsigned characters. The structure is designed to facilitate operations that require comparing or verifying the equality of ciphertexts in cryptographic protocols.

### fd\_zksdk\_ciph\_ciph\_eq\_context\_t
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `pubkey1`: A 32-byte array representing a point, likely a public key.
    - `pubkey2`: A 32-byte array representing another point, likely a second public key.
    - `ciphertext1`: A 64-byte array representing two points, likely a ciphertext.
    - `ciphertext2`: A 64-byte array representing another two points, likely a second ciphertext.
- **Description**: The `fd_zksdk_ciph_ciph_eq_context_t` structure is designed to hold cryptographic data related to ciphertext equality proofs. It contains two public keys and two ciphertexts, each represented as byte arrays. The structure is packed to ensure no padding is added between its members, which is crucial for cryptographic operations where precise control over data layout is required.
