# Purpose
The provided content is a segment from a Makefile, which is a build automation tool used to compile and link programs. This specific section is conditional, executed only if the macro `FD_HAS_INT128` is defined, indicating that the system supports 128-bit integers. Within this block, the `add-objs` function is called multiple times to add object files related to various cryptographic operations, such as zero-knowledge proofs and ciphertext validity checks, to the `fd_flamenco` target. These object files, prefixed with `fd_zksdk`, suggest they are part of a zero-knowledge software development kit (SDK) and are likely used to ensure the correctness and security of cryptographic operations within the project.
