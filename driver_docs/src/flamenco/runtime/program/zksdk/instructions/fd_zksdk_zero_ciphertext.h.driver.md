# Purpose
This C header file defines data structures related to zero-knowledge proofs in the context of cryptographic operations, specifically for handling zero ciphertexts. It includes two packed structures: `fd_zksdk_zero_ciphertext_proof`, which contains three 32-byte arrays representing cryptographic points and a scalar, and `fd_zksdk_zero_ciphertext_context`, which includes a 32-byte public key and a 64-byte ciphertext. The use of `__attribute__((packed))` ensures that these structures are tightly packed without any padding, which is crucial for cryptographic data integrity and interoperability. The file also includes a base header file, `fd_flamenco_base.h`, suggesting that it is part of a larger cryptographic library or framework.

### fd\_zksdk\_zero\_ciphertext\_proof
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `yp`: An array of 32 unsigned characters representing a point.
    - `yd`: An array of 32 unsigned characters representing a point.
    - `z`: An array of 32 unsigned characters representing a scalar.
- **Description**: The `fd_zksdk_zero_ciphertext_proof` structure is a packed data structure used in cryptographic operations, specifically for zero-knowledge proofs related to ciphertexts. It contains three members: `yp` and `yd`, which are 32-byte arrays representing cryptographic points, and `z`, a 32-byte array representing a scalar value. This structure is likely used to store proof data in a compact form for efficient transmission or storage in cryptographic protocols.

- **Members**:
    - `yp`: A 32-byte array representing a point.
    - `yd`: A 32-byte array representing a point.
    - `z`: A 32-byte array representing a scalar.
- **Description**: The `fd_zksdk_zero_ciphertext_proof_t` structure is a packed data structure used in cryptographic operations, specifically for zero-knowledge proofs related to ciphertexts. It contains three members: `yp` and `yd`, which are 32-byte arrays representing cryptographic points, and `z`, a 32-byte array representing a scalar value. This structure is likely used to store proof data that verifies certain properties of ciphertexts without revealing the underlying information.

### fd\_zksdk\_zero\_ciphertext\_context
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `pubkey`: An array of 32 unsigned characters representing a public key point.
    - `ciphertext`: An array of 64 unsigned characters representing two points of ciphertext.
- **Description**: The `fd_zksdk_zero_ciphertext_context` structure is a packed data structure designed to hold cryptographic information, specifically a public key and ciphertext. The `pubkey` member is a 32-byte array that stores a point, likely used as a public key in cryptographic operations. The `ciphertext` member is a 64-byte array that stores two points, which are used as ciphertext in cryptographic processes. This structure is part of a cryptographic library, possibly related to zero-knowledge proofs or secure communication protocols.

### fd\_zksdk\_zero\_ciphertext\_context\_t
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `pubkey`: A 32-byte array representing a public key point.
    - `ciphertext`: A 64-byte array representing two points of ciphertext.
- **Description**: The `fd_zksdk_zero_ciphertext_context_t` structure is designed to hold cryptographic data related to zero-knowledge proofs. It contains a public key and a ciphertext, both stored as byte arrays, which are essential for cryptographic operations involving elliptic curve points and encrypted data.
