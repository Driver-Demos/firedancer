# Purpose
This C source code file is part of a cryptographic library, specifically designed to verify proofs of ciphertext-commitment equality. The file provides a focused functionality, implementing the verification process for a specific cryptographic proof. The main components include functions for initializing a cryptographic transcript, validating scalar values, decompressing elliptic curve points, and performing multi-scalar multiplication (MSM) on elliptic curve points. The code is structured around the use of the Ristretto255 curve, a prime-order elliptic curve, and employs Curve25519 scalar operations to ensure the integrity and correctness of the cryptographic proof.

The file defines a public API for verifying proofs, which is likely intended to be used by other parts of the cryptographic library or by external applications that require proof verification. The function [`fd_zksdk_instr_verify_proof_ciphertext_commitment_equality`](#fd_zksdk_instr_verify_proof_ciphertext_commitment_equality) serves as the entry point for this verification process, orchestrating the initialization of the cryptographic transcript and invoking the core verification function. The code ensures that all inputs are validated and that the cryptographic operations are performed securely, adhering to the principles of zero-knowledge proofs. This file is a critical component of a larger cryptographic system, providing essential functionality for applications that require secure and efficient proof verification.

# Functions

### ciph\_comm\_eq\_transcript\_init<!-- {{#callable:ciph_comm_eq_transcript_init}} -->
The `ciph_comm_eq_transcript_init` function initializes a transcript for a ciphertext-commitment equality proof by appending public key, ciphertext, and commitment data to it.
- **Inputs**:
    - `transcript`: A pointer to an `fd_zksdk_transcript_t` structure that will be initialized and appended with data.
    - `context`: A pointer to a constant `fd_zksdk_ciph_comm_eq_context_t` structure containing the public key, ciphertext, and commitment to be appended to the transcript.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Call `fd_zksdk_transcript_init` to initialize the transcript with a specific literal string indicating the type of instruction.
    - Append the public key from the context to the transcript using `fd_zksdk_transcript_append_pubkey`.
    - Append the ciphertext from the context to the transcript using `fd_zksdk_transcript_append_ciphertext`.
    - Append the commitment from the context to the transcript using `fd_zksdk_transcript_append_commitment`.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it modifies the `transcript` in place by appending the specified data.

### fd\_zksdk\_verify\_proof\_ciphertext\_commitment\_equality<!-- {{#callable:fd_zksdk_verify_proof_ciphertext_commitment_equality}} -->
The function `fd_zksdk_verify_proof_ciphertext_commitment_equality` verifies the equality of a ciphertext and a commitment using a zero-knowledge proof by performing a multi-scalar multiplication (MSM) and checking the result against a given point.
- **Inputs**:
    - `proof`: A pointer to a `fd_zksdk_ciph_comm_eq_proof_t` structure containing the proof data, including scalars `zs`, `zx`, `zr`, and points `y0`, `y1`, `y2`.
    - `pubkey`: A 32-byte array representing the public key.
    - `ciphertext`: A 64-byte array representing the ciphertext, which is split into two 32-byte parts.
    - `commitment`: A 32-byte array representing the commitment.
    - `transcript`: A pointer to a `fd_zksdk_transcript_t` structure used for maintaining the transcript of the proof verification process.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize arrays for scalars and points, and validate the input scalars `zs`, `zx`, and `zr` using `fd_curve25519_scalar_validate`.
    - Set the first two points to base points `G` and `H`, and decompress the proof points `y0`, `y1`, `y2`, and the input points `pubkey`, `ciphertext`, and `commitment` into the points array.
    - Initialize the transcript with domain separation and append the proof points `y0`, `y1`, `y2` to the transcript, checking for success.
    - Extract challenge scalars `c` and `w` from the transcript, and append the proof scalars `zs`, `zx`, `zr` to the transcript.
    - Compute the scalars for the MSM using the challenge scalars and proof scalars, performing operations like negation, multiplication, and addition.
    - Perform the multi-scalar multiplication (MSM) with the computed scalars and points, storing the result in `res`.
    - Check if the result `res` is equal to the decompressed point `y2`, returning success if they are equal, otherwise returning an error.
- **Output**: The function returns `FD_EXECUTOR_INSTR_SUCCESS` if the proof is verified successfully, otherwise it returns `FD_ZKSDK_VERIFY_PROOF_ERROR`.

### fd\_zksdk\_instr\_verify\_proof\_ciphertext\_commitment\_equality<!-- {{#callable:fd_zksdk_instr_verify_proof_ciphertext_commitment_equality}} -->
The function `fd_zksdk_instr_verify_proof_ciphertext_commitment_equality` initializes a transcript and verifies the equality of a ciphertext and commitment proof using the provided context and proof data.
- **Inputs**:
    - `_context`: A pointer to a `fd_zksdk_ciph_comm_eq_context_t` structure containing the public key, ciphertext, and commitment data required for the verification process.
    - `_proof`: A pointer to a `fd_zksdk_ciph_comm_eq_proof_t` structure containing the proof data to be verified.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize a `fd_zksdk_transcript_t` object to store the transcript data.
    - Cast the `_context` and `_proof` pointers to their respective types: `fd_zksdk_ciph_comm_eq_context_t` and `fd_zksdk_ciph_comm_eq_proof_t`.
    - Call [`ciph_comm_eq_transcript_init`](#ciph_comm_eq_transcript_init) to initialize the transcript with the context's public key, ciphertext, and commitment.
    - Call [`fd_zksdk_verify_proof_ciphertext_commitment_equality`](#fd_zksdk_verify_proof_ciphertext_commitment_equality) with the proof, context's public key, ciphertext, commitment, and the initialized transcript to verify the proof.
    - Return the result of the verification function, which indicates success or failure of the proof verification.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer indicating the success or failure of the proof verification, where a specific success code indicates a successful verification and an error code indicates failure.
