# Purpose
The provided C code is part of a cryptographic software library, specifically designed to handle zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) for range proofs on 64-bit unsigned integers. The file includes two main functions: [`fd_zksdk_verify_proof_range_u64`](#fd_zksdk_verify_proof_range_u64) and [`fd_zksdk_instr_verify_proof_batched_range_proof_u64`](#fd_zksdk_instr_verify_proof_batched_range_proof_u64). The first function, [`fd_zksdk_verify_proof_range_u64`](#fd_zksdk_verify_proof_range_u64), is a static inline function that verifies a single range proof using the provided proof data, commitments, bit lengths, and a transcript. It utilizes an internal proof structure (`fd_rangeproofs_ipp_proof_t`) and calls another function, `fd_rangeproofs_verify`, to perform the actual verification. The result of this verification determines the return value, indicating success or an error.

The second function, [`fd_zksdk_instr_verify_proof_batched_range_proof_u64`](#fd_zksdk_instr_verify_proof_batched_range_proof_u64), is responsible for verifying a batched range proof. It initializes and validates the proof context and transcript, and then calls the first function to verify each proof in the batch. This function is likely part of a larger system that processes multiple proofs simultaneously, optimizing for performance and efficiency. The code is structured to be part of a library, as indicated by the inclusion of a private header file and the use of specific data structures and constants. It does not define public APIs directly but rather implements internal functionality that could be exposed through higher-level interfaces in the library.

# Functions

### fd\_zksdk\_verify\_proof\_range\_u64<!-- {{#callable:fd_zksdk_verify_proof_range_u64}} -->
The function `fd_zksdk_verify_proof_range_u64` verifies a range proof for a 64-bit unsigned integer using given commitments, bit lengths, and a transcript.
- **Inputs**:
    - `proof`: A pointer to a `fd_zksdk_range_proof_u64_proof_t` structure containing the range proof data to be verified.
    - `commitments`: An array of 32 unsigned characters representing the commitments associated with the proof.
    - `bit_lengths`: An array of 1 unsigned character representing the bit lengths of the values involved in the proof.
    - `batch_len`: An unsigned character representing the length of the batch for the proof verification.
    - `transcript`: A pointer to a `fd_zksdk_transcript_t` structure used to maintain the state of the proof verification process.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize a `fd_rangeproofs_ipp_proof_t` structure `ipp_proof` with specific values from the `proof` parameter.
    - Call the `fd_rangeproofs_verify` function with the range proof, `ipp_proof`, commitments, bit lengths, batch length, and transcript to perform the verification.
    - Check if the result of the verification (`res`) is equal to `FD_RANGEPROOFS_SUCCESS`.
    - If the verification is successful, return `FD_EXECUTOR_INSTR_SUCCESS`.
    - If the verification fails, return `FD_ZKSDK_VERIFY_PROOF_ERROR`.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer indicating the success or failure of the proof verification, specifically `FD_EXECUTOR_INSTR_SUCCESS` on success or `FD_ZKSDK_VERIFY_PROOF_ERROR` on failure.

### fd\_zksdk\_instr\_verify\_proof\_batched\_range\_proof\_u64<!-- {{#callable:fd_zksdk_instr_verify_proof_batched_range_proof_u64}} -->
The function `fd_zksdk_instr_verify_proof_batched_range_proof_u64` verifies a batched range proof for 64-bit unsigned integers using a given context and proof data.
- **Inputs**:
    - `_context`: A pointer to a `fd_zksdk_batched_range_proof_context_t` structure containing the context for the batched range proof verification.
    - `_proof`: A pointer to a `fd_zksdk_range_proof_u64_proof_t` structure containing the proof data to be verified.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize a transcript and cast the input pointers to their respective types for context and proof.
    - Initialize a `batch_len` variable to zero.
    - Call `batched_range_proof_init_and_validate` to initialize and validate the batch length and transcript using the context; if this function does not return `FD_EXECUTOR_INSTR_SUCCESS`, return the error code immediately.
    - Call [`fd_zksdk_verify_proof_range_u64`](#fd_zksdk_verify_proof_range_u64) with the proof, context commitments, bit lengths, batch length, and transcript to perform the actual verification of the range proof.
    - Return the result of the verification function.
- **Output**: Returns an integer status code indicating success (`FD_EXECUTOR_INSTR_SUCCESS`) or an error code if the verification fails.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`fd_zksdk_verify_proof_range_u64`](#fd_zksdk_verify_proof_range_u64)
