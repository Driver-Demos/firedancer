# Purpose
This code is a C header file that defines data structures related to public key validity in a cryptographic context, likely for use in a zero-knowledge proof system. It includes two packed structures: `fd_zksdk_pubkey_validity_proof`, which contains two 32-byte arrays representing a point and a scalar, and `fd_zksdk_pubkey_validity_context`, which contains a single 32-byte array representing a public key point. The use of `__attribute__((packed))` ensures that the structures are tightly packed without any padding, which is crucial for cryptographic operations where precise control over data layout is necessary. The header guards prevent multiple inclusions of this file, ensuring that the structures are defined only once during compilation.

# Data Structures

---
### fd\_zksdk\_pubkey\_validity\_proof
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `y`: An array of 32 unsigned characters representing a point.
    - `z`: An array of 32 unsigned characters representing a scalar.
- **Description**: The `fd_zksdk_pubkey_validity_proof` structure is a packed data structure used to represent a proof of public key validity in a zero-knowledge SDK. It contains two members: `y`, which is a 32-byte array representing a point, and `z`, which is a 32-byte array representing a scalar. This structure is likely used in cryptographic operations to verify the validity of a public key without revealing the key itself.

### fd\_zksdk\_pubkey\_validity\_proof\_t
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `y`: An array of 32 unsigned characters representing a point.
    - `z`: An array of 32 unsigned characters representing a scalar.
- **Description**: The `fd_zksdk_pubkey_validity_proof_t` structure is a packed data structure used to store cryptographic proof data, specifically a point and a scalar, each represented as an array of 32 unsigned characters. This structure is likely used in the context of validating public keys within a zero-knowledge proof system, where the point and scalar are essential components of the proof.


---
### fd\_zksdk\_pubkey\_validity\_context
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `pubkey`: An array of 32 unsigned characters representing a point.
- **Description**: The `fd_zksdk_pubkey_validity_context` is a packed structure designed to hold a public key represented as a 32-byte array. This structure is likely used in cryptographic contexts where the public key is a point on an elliptic curve or similar mathematical structure, ensuring the validity of the public key within the system.


---
### fd\_zksdk\_pubkey\_validity\_context\_t
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `pubkey`: A 32-byte array representing a public key point.
- **Description**: The `fd_zksdk_pubkey_validity_context_t` is a packed structure that contains a single member, `pubkey`, which is a 32-byte array used to store a public key point. This structure is likely used in cryptographic operations where public key validity needs to be verified or managed.
