# Purpose
This C header file, `fd_zksdk_private.h`, is part of a larger software system that deals with zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) within a cryptographic framework. The file primarily defines internal structures, constants, and function prototypes related to the verification of various cryptographic proofs. It includes a series of headers that provide specific functionalities, such as handling different types of cryptographic instructions and proofs, including zero ciphertext, ciphertext equality, and public key validity. The file also defines macros and constants that are used to manage error handling and basepoints for Pedersen commitments, which are essential in cryptographic operations.

The file is not intended to be a standalone executable but rather a component of a larger library or application, likely used internally within the system to facilitate the verification of cryptographic proofs. It defines a set of function prototypes using a macro to ensure consistency across different proof verification functions. These functions are designed to verify various cryptographic properties, such as equality and validity, in a structured and efficient manner. The file also includes metadata structures that are used to manage the state of proof contexts, indicating its role in maintaining the integrity and correctness of cryptographic operations within the system.

### fd\_zksdk\_context\_sz
- **Type**: `array of ulong`
- **Description**: The `fd_zksdk_context_sz` is a static constant array of unsigned long integers that holds the sizes of various context structures used in zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) verification instructions. Each element in the array corresponds to the size of a specific context structure required for a particular ZKP verification instruction, such as verifying zero ciphertext, ciphertext equality, and other cryptographic proofs.
- **Use**: This array is used to determine the size of context structures needed for different ZKP verification instructions in the SDK.

### fd\_zksdk\_proof\_sz
- **Type**: `array of ulong`
- **Description**: The `fd_zksdk_proof_sz` is a static constant array of unsigned long integers that holds the sizes of various proof structures used in zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) verification instructions. Each element in the array corresponds to the size of a specific proof type, such as zero ciphertext proof, ciphertext equality proof, and others, as defined by the ZKP SDK.
- **Use**: This array is used to determine the size of proof structures required for different ZKP verification instructions.

### DEFINE\_VERIFY\_PROOF
- **Type**: `Macro`
- **Description**: `DEFINE_VERIFY_PROOF` is a macro used to define a series of function prototypes for verifying different types of zero-knowledge proofs. It takes a single argument, `name`, and generates a function prototype for `fd_zksdk_instr_verify_proof_ ## name`, which is a function that verifies a specific type of proof using the provided context and proof data.
- **Use**: This macro is used to streamline the definition of multiple proof verification function prototypes, ensuring consistency and reducing code duplication.


# Data Structures

### fd\_zksdk\_proof\_ctx\_state\_meta
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `ctx_state_authority`: A public key type representing the authority of the context state.
    - `proof_type`: An unsigned character indicating the type of proof.
- **Description**: The `fd_zksdk_proof_ctx_state_meta` structure is a packed data structure used to store metadata about a proof context state in the ZK-SDK framework. It contains a public key (`ctx_state_authority`) that signifies the authority of the context state and a `proof_type` field that specifies the type of proof being handled. This structure is likely used in the context of zero-knowledge proof verification processes, where different proof types and authorities need to be managed efficiently.
