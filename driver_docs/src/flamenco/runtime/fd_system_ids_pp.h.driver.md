# Purpose
This C source code file is a collection of macro definitions that represent various system and program identifiers as arrays of unsigned integers. These identifiers are likely used in a larger system, possibly a blockchain or distributed ledger technology, to uniquely identify different system variables, programs, and configurations. The use of `#define` macros allows these identifiers to be easily referenced throughout the codebase without the need for include guards, as they are purely preprocessor directives. Each identifier is represented as a sequence of hexadecimal values, which are unsigned to ensure consistent interpretation by the preprocessor. This file serves as a centralized repository for these identifiers, facilitating their use in other parts of the system where these specific IDs are required for operations or configurations.
