# Purpose
This Bash script is designed to automate the process of updating, building, and testing a software project from a nightly repository. It provides a narrow functionality focused on continuous integration or nightly builds, ensuring that the latest code is pulled from a specified branch, the environment is set up correctly, dependencies are managed, and the project is built and tested. The script is not an executable or a library but rather a utility script intended to be run in a specific environment where the necessary tools and paths are configured. It includes steps for cleaning previous builds, setting up the environment, installing dependencies, and executing tests, with the results being logged to a file.
