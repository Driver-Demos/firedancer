# Purpose
This code is a C header file designed for a testing framework, specifically for fuzz testing within a runtime environment. It includes necessary dependencies, such as `fd_instr_harness.h` and a generated protocol buffer header `pack.pb.h`, indicating that it deals with serialized data structures. The file declares a single function prototype, [`fd_runtime_fuzz_pack_cpb_run`](#fd_runtime_fuzz_pack_cpb_run), which is likely responsible for executing a fuzz test on a given input and producing an output, utilizing a buffer for the output data. The use of include guards ensures that the header's contents are only included once during compilation, preventing redefinition errors. Overall, this header file sets up the interface for a fuzz testing harness in a larger software system.
