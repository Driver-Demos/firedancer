# Purpose
This C header file, `fd_block_harness.h`, is part of a testing framework for a runtime system, likely related to blockchain or distributed ledger technology, given the context of transactions and blocks. It includes several other headers that suggest integration with an executor, voting and staking programs, system variables, and reward mechanisms. The file defines constants for configuring a thread pool used in block execution, highlighting a trade-off between the number of workers and memory usage. The primary function prototype, [`fd_runtime_fuzz_block_run`](#fd_runtime_fuzz_block_run), is designed to execute a block of transactions, testing specific aspects of the system such as epoch boundaries and block execution, while excluding signature verification and proof of history (POH) checks. This setup is intended for fuzz testing, a method used to identify potential vulnerabilities or bugs by providing random data inputs.

# Function Declarations (Public API)

---
### fd\_runtime\_fuzz\_block\_run<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_runtime_fuzz_block_run}} -->
Executes a block of transactions and captures execution effects.
- **Description**: This function is used to execute a block containing zero or more transactions within a specified runtime environment. It requires all necessary system variables to be provided, except for the recent blockhashes sysvar account, which is populated through the input blockhash queue. The function does not test signature verification or Proof of History (POH), but it does test epoch boundaries. It is designed to work with the Firedancer code and the Agave entrypoint, excluding certain verifications. The function captures the effects of the block execution and stores them in the provided output buffer.
- **Inputs**:
    - `runner`: A pointer to an fd_runtime_fuzz_runner_t structure that manages the execution context. Must not be null.
    - `input_`: A pointer to the input data representing the block to be executed. The data must be formatted correctly as expected by the function.
    - `output_`: A pointer to a location where the function will store a pointer to the execution effects. The caller must provide a valid pointer for this output.
    - `output_buf`: A buffer where the function will store the execution effects. The buffer must be large enough to hold the effects data.
    - `output_bufsz`: The size of the output buffer in bytes. Must be sufficient to store the execution effects; otherwise, the function may abort.
- **Output**: Returns the number of bytes written to the output buffer. If the buffer is insufficient, the function may abort.
