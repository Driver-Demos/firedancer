# Purpose
This code is a C header file generated by the nanopb library, specifically version 0.4.9.1, which is used for encoding and decoding Protocol Buffers (protobufs) in C. The file defines a structure `fd_exec_test_fixture_metadata_t` that represents metadata for a test fixture, with a single string field `fn_entrypoint` of length 129. It includes macros for initializing this structure with default or zero values, and specifies encoding details for use with nanopb, such as field tags and encoding specifications. The header also ensures compatibility with older versions of nanopb and provides a mechanism for C++ compatibility through `extern "C"`. The file is part of a larger system, as indicated by the inclusion of another header file, `pb_firedancer.h`, and is designed to be regenerated if the nanopb version changes, ensuring consistency with the protobuf schema.

### fd\_exec\_test\_fixture\_metadata\_t
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `fn_entrypoint`: A character array of size 129 that stores the entry point function name for the test fixture.
- **Description**: The `fd_exec_test_fixture_metadata_t` structure is used to store metadata related to a test fixture, specifically the entry point function name. It is part of a nanopb-generated header file, which suggests it is used in protocol buffer serialization. The structure contains a single member, `fn_entrypoint`, which is a character array designed to hold a string of up to 128 characters plus a null terminator, representing the entry point function name for the test fixture.
