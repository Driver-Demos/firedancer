# Purpose
This C header file is an automatically generated component of the nanopb library, specifically designed for protocol buffer serialization and deserialization. It defines data structures and associated metadata for handling compute budget-related messages within the Solana Sealevel runtime environment. The file includes type definitions for three primary structures: `fd_exec_test_pack_compute_budget_context_t`, `fd_exec_test_pack_compute_budget_effects_t`, and `fd_exec_test_pack_compute_budget_fixture_t`. These structures encapsulate the context, effects, and fixture data related to compute budget operations, which are crucial for managing computational resources and rewards in a blockchain environment like Solana.

The header file also provides initialization macros for these structures, ensuring they can be easily instantiated with default or zeroed values. Additionally, it defines field tags and encoding specifications necessary for nanopb's encoding and decoding processes. The file includes compatibility mappings for older versions of nanopb, ensuring that existing codebases can seamlessly integrate with this updated header. Overall, this file serves as a critical interface for developers working with compute budget data in Solana's runtime, facilitating efficient data handling and interoperability through protocol buffers.

# Data Structures

### fd\_exec\_test\_pack\_compute\_budget\_context\_t
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `instr_datas_count`: Holds the count of instruction data arrays.
    - `instr_datas`: A pointer to an array of pointers, each pointing to a byte array representing instruction data.
- **Description**: The `fd_exec_test_pack_compute_budget_context_t` structure is designed to encapsulate the context for computing budget-related operations in a test execution environment. It primarily manages a collection of instruction data arrays, where `instr_datas_count` indicates the number of such arrays, and `instr_datas` is a pointer to these arrays. This structure is part of a larger framework for handling compute budget tests, likely used in scenarios where multiple sets of instructions need to be processed or evaluated.

### fd\_exec\_test\_pack\_compute\_budget\_effects\_t
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `compute_unit_limit`: Represents the maximum number of compute units that can be used.
    - `rewards`: Indicates the rewards associated with the compute budget.
- **Description**: The `fd_exec_test_pack_compute_budget_effects_t` structure is designed to encapsulate the effects of a compute budget in a test execution context. It contains two fields: `compute_unit_limit`, which specifies the upper limit of compute units that can be utilized, and `rewards`, which denotes the rewards linked to the compute budget. This structure is part of a larger framework for testing and managing compute budgets in a system, likely related to the Solana blockchain environment.


---
### fd\_exec\_test\_pack\_compute\_budget\_fixture\_t
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `has_metadata`: A boolean indicating if metadata is present.
    - `metadata`: Holds metadata information of type `fd_exec_test_fixture_metadata_t`.
    - `has_input`: A boolean indicating if input data is present.
    - `input`: Contains input context data of type `fd_exec_test_pack_compute_budget_context_t`.
    - `has_output`: A boolean indicating if output data is present.
    - `output`: Holds output effects data of type `fd_exec_test_pack_compute_budget_effects_t`.
- **Description**: The `fd_exec_test_pack_compute_budget_fixture_t` structure is designed to encapsulate a test fixture for computing budget operations, including metadata, input context, and output effects. It uses boolean flags to indicate the presence of metadata, input, and output data, and it aggregates these components into a single structure to facilitate testing and validation of compute budget operations.
