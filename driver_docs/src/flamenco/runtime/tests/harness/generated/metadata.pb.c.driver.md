# Purpose
This code is a C header file that contains automatically generated constant definitions for use with the nanopb library, a small code-size Protocol Buffers implementation in C. It includes a generated header file, `metadata.pb.h`, which likely contains Protocol Buffers definitions. The file checks for compatibility with a specific version of the nanopb generator by comparing `PB_PROTO_HEADER_VERSION` to ensure it matches the expected version (40), and it raises a compilation error if there is a mismatch, prompting regeneration with the correct version. The `PB_BIND` macro is used to bind a Protocol Buffers message type, `FD_EXEC_TEST_FIXTURE_METADATA`, to a corresponding C structure, `fd_exec_test_fixture_metadata_t`, with automatic field handling. This file is part of a system that uses Protocol Buffers for data serialization and deserialization.
