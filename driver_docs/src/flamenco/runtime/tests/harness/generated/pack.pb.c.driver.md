# Purpose
This code is an automatically generated C source file that defines constant bindings for Protocol Buffers (protobuf) using the nanopb library, specifically version 0.4.9.1. It includes a header file, "pack.pb.h," which likely contains the protobuf message definitions. The file checks for compatibility with the nanopb generator by verifying the `PB_PROTO_HEADER_VERSION` and prompts regeneration if there is a version mismatch. The `PB_BIND` macro is used to bind C structures to their corresponding protobuf message types, facilitating serialization and deserialization of data structures like `fd_exec_test_pack_compute_budget_context_t`, `fd_exec_test_pack_compute_budget_effects_t`, and `fd_exec_test_pack_compute_budget_fixture_t`. This file is part of a system that uses nanopb to handle protobuf messages efficiently in C.
