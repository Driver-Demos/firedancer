# Purpose
This source code file is an automatically generated C header file created by the nanopb library, version 0.4.9.1, which is a small code generator for Google's Protocol Buffers. The file includes the "block.pb.h" header and contains preprocessor directives to ensure compatibility with the correct version of the nanopb generator, specifically checking that `PB_PROTO_HEADER_VERSION` is 40. It defines bindings for several Protocol Buffer message types using the `PB_BIND` macro, which associates C data structures with their corresponding Protocol Buffer message types. These bindings include `FD_EXEC_TEST_MICROBLOCK`, `FD_EXEC_TEST_BLOCK_CONTEXT`, `FD_EXEC_TEST_BLOCK_EFFECTS`, and `FD_EXEC_TEST_BLOCK_FIXTURE`, with some using automatic field numbering and others specifying a field number of 2. The purpose of this file is to facilitate the serialization and deserialization of these specific Protocol Buffer messages in a C application.
