# Purpose
This C source code file is an automatically generated set of constant definitions for use with the nanopb library, a small code-size Protocol Buffers implementation in C. The file includes a header file, "pack_runtime.pb.h", and checks for compatibility with a specific version of the Protocol Buffers header, ensuring that the file is regenerated if the version does not match. It uses the `PB_BIND` macro to bind Protocol Buffer message types to their corresponding C structures, specifically for `fd_exec_test_pack_compute_budget_context_t`, `fd_exec_test_pack_compute_budget_effects_t`, and `fd_exec_test_pack_compute_budget_fixture_t`. This setup facilitates the serialization and deserialization of these message types, which are likely part of a larger system dealing with budget computation in a testing or execution context.
