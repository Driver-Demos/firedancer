# Purpose
This C header file is an automatically generated nanopb header, which is part of a protocol buffer implementation for handling ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) binaries within the context of the Solana Sealevel runtime environment. The file defines several data structures and associated macros that facilitate the encoding and decoding of protocol buffer messages related to ELF binaries. These structures include `fd_exec_test_elf_binary_t`, `fd_exec_test_elf_loader_ctx_t`, `fd_exec_test_elf_loader_effects_t`, and `fd_exec_test_elf_loader_fixture_t`, each serving a specific role in representing the binary data, loader context, loading effects, and test fixtures, respectively. The header also includes initialization macros and field tags for these structures, which are essential for managing the serialized data and ensuring compatibility with the nanopb library.

The file is intended to be included in other C source files that require interaction with ELF binaries in a protocol buffer format. It provides a narrow functionality focused on the serialization and deserialization of ELF-related data structures, which are crucial for testing and deploying ELF binaries in the Solana Sealevel environment. The header ensures that the data structures are correctly initialized and provides backward compatibility with previous versions of nanopb. Additionally, it includes checks to ensure that the correct version of the nanopb generator is used, maintaining consistency and reliability in the generated code.

# Data Structures

---
### fd\_exec\_test\_elf\_binary\_t
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `data`: A pointer to a pb_bytes_array_t structure, representing the binary data of the ELF file.
- **Description**: The `fd_exec_test_elf_binary_t` structure is designed to encapsulate the binary data of an ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) file. It contains a single member, `data`, which is a pointer to a `pb_bytes_array_t` structure. This structure is used in the context of nanopb, a small code-size Protocol Buffers implementation in C, to handle byte arrays. The `fd_exec_test_elf_binary_t` is part of a larger system for testing and executing ELF binaries, particularly in environments where nanopb is used for serialization and deserialization of data.

### fd\_exec\_test\_elf\_loader\_ctx\_t
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `has_elf`: Indicates whether an ELF binary is present.
    - `elf`: Holds the ELF binary data.
    - `has_features`: Indicates whether feature set information is present.
    - `features`: Holds the feature set data.
    - `elf_sz`: Stores the size of the ELF binary.
    - `deploy_checks`: Indicates whether deployment checks are enabled.
- **Description**: The `fd_exec_test_elf_loader_ctx_t` structure is designed to encapsulate the context required for loading an ELF binary, including the binary itself, its size, and any associated features. It also includes flags to indicate the presence of the ELF binary and feature set, as well as a flag for enabling deployment checks. This structure is part of a larger system for testing ELF loading and execution, potentially within a Solana Sealevel environment.


---
### fd\_exec\_test\_elf\_loader\_effects\_t
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `rodata`: A pointer to a pb_bytes_array_t structure representing read-only data.
    - `rodata_sz`: A 64-bit unsigned integer representing the size of the read-only data.
    - `text_cnt`: A 64-bit unsigned integer representing the count of text sections.
    - `text_off`: A 64-bit unsigned integer representing the offset of the text section within the read-only data.
    - `entry_pc`: A 64-bit unsigned integer representing the entry point program counter.
    - `calldests_count`: A pb_size_t representing the number of call destinations.
    - `calldests`: A pointer to an array of 64-bit unsigned integers representing call destinations.
- **Description**: The `fd_exec_test_elf_loader_effects_t` structure captures the results of loading an ELF binary, including details about the read-only data, text sections, entry point, and call destinations. It is structurally similar to `fd_sbpf_program_t` and is used to store the effects of loading an ELF binary, such as the size and location of read-only data, the number and offset of text sections, the entry point program counter, and the destinations of function calls.


---
### fd\_exec\_test\_elf\_loader\_fixture\_t
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `has_metadata`: Indicates if metadata is present in the fixture.
    - `metadata`: Holds the metadata information for the fixture.
    - `has_input`: Indicates if input data is present in the fixture.
    - `input`: Contains the input context for the ELF loader.
    - `has_output`: Indicates if output data is present in the fixture.
    - `output`: Stores the effects or results of the ELF loader execution.
- **Description**: The `fd_exec_test_elf_loader_fixture_t` structure is designed to encapsulate the necessary components for testing an ELF loader, including metadata, input context, and output effects. It uses boolean flags to indicate the presence of metadata, input, and output, and contains detailed structures for each component to facilitate comprehensive testing and validation of ELF loading processes.
