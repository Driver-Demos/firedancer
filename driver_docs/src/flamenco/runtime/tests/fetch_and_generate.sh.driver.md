# Purpose
This Bash script is designed to automate the setup and configuration of a development environment for working with Protocol Buffers and gRPC using the nanopb library. It provides narrow functionality focused on setting up a virtual environment, installing necessary Python packages, and managing the nanopb and protosol repositories. The script first creates a Python virtual environment and installs the `protobuf` and `grpcio-tools` packages. It then checks for the existence of the nanopb directory, cloning the repository if it doesn't exist, and checks out a specific tag defined in an external file. Similarly, it manages the protosol repository by cloning or updating it as needed. Finally, the script runs the nanopb generator to process Protocol Buffer files, indicating its role in preparing the environment for further development tasks involving Protocol Buffers.
# Imports and Dependencies

- `pip`
- `git`


# Global Variables

---
### SCRIPT\_DIR
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: The `SCRIPT_DIR` variable is a string that holds the absolute path to the directory where the current script is located. It is determined by using a combination of shell commands to navigate to the script's directory and then obtaining the present working directory.
- **Use**: This variable is used to reference the script's directory path, which can be useful for relative path operations within the script.


---
### FD\_NANOPB\_TAG
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: `FD_NANOPB_TAG` is a global variable that stores the content of the file located at `../../../ballet/nanopb/nanopb_tag.txt`. This file is expected to contain a specific tag or version identifier for the nanopb repository.
- **Use**: This variable is used to specify the tag or version of the nanopb repository to fetch and checkout during the script execution.
