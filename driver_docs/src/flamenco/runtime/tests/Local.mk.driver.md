# Purpose
The provided content is from a Makefile, which is a build automation tool used to manage the build process of a software project. This Makefile defines rules and dependencies for compiling and linking various components of a project, specifically focusing on the generation and inclusion of protocol buffer headers and object files. It includes conditional logic to add headers and objects based on the presence of certain features, such as `FD_HAS_INT128` and `FD_HAS_SECP256K1`, which likely correspond to specific capabilities or libraries. The file also specifies commands for running different types of runtime tests and backtests, including nightly tests, using Python scripts and shell scripts. These tests are designed to validate the functionality and performance of the software in various environments, such as mainnet, by utilizing specific snapshots and configurations.
