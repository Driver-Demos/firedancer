# Purpose
This file is a Bash script used to automate the execution of a series of ledger backtests for different network environments, such as mainnet, devnet, and testnet. Each line in the script calls another script, `run_ledger_backtest.sh`, with specific parameters that include the ledger identifier (`-l`), a snapshot file (`-s`), a year parameter (`-y`), a memory limit (`-m`), an end block number (`-e`), and a version code (`-c`). The script provides narrow functionality focused on testing the ledger's performance and behavior under various conditions and configurations. The relevance of this file to the codebase lies in its role in ensuring the reliability and correctness of the ledger system by systematically running backtests across different network states and configurations.
# Content Summary
This script is a Bash script designed to execute a series of ledger backtests using a specific testing script located at `src/flamenco/runtime/tests/run_ledger_backtest.sh`. The script is configured to terminate immediately if any command exits with a non-zero status, as indicated by the `set -e` command at the beginning.

Each line in the script represents a separate invocation of the `run_ledger_backtest.sh` script, with various parameters specified for each test. The key parameters used in these invocations include:

- `-l`: Specifies the ledger identifier, which includes the network type (e.g., mainnet, devnet, testnet) and a unique identifier for the ledger.
- `-s`: Indicates the snapshot file to be used for the backtest. These files are compressed with the `.tar.zst` format and are uniquely named to correspond with the ledger.
- `-y`: Sets the year parameter for the backtest, with values of either 5 or 10.
- `-m`: Specifies the memory limit for the test, consistently set to 2000000 across all invocations.
- `-e`: Denotes the end block or epoch for the backtest, which varies for each test.
- `-c`: Indicates the version of the software or protocol being tested, with versions such as 2.0.23, 2.1.13, 2.1.14, and 2.2.14 being used.

The script is structured to test different configurations across various network environments, including mainnet, devnet, and testnet, with specific snapshots and configurations tailored to each environment. This setup allows developers to validate the behavior and performance of the ledger under different conditions and software versions, ensuring robustness and reliability across different network states and configurations.
