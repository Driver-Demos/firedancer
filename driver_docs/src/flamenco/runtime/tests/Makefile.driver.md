# Purpose
This is a Makefile, a build automation tool configuration file, which defines a target named `all` that depends on another target `fetch_and_generate`. The `fetch_and_generate` target executes a shell script named `fetch_and_generate.sh`, automating the process of fetching data and generating necessary outputs.
