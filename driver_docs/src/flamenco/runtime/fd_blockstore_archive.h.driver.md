# Purpose
This C header file defines structures and function prototypes for managing the serialization and archiving of blocks in a blockstore system, likely used in a database or storage context. It includes necessary headers for blockstore and RocksDB functionalities, indicating its role in handling data persistence and retrieval. The `fd_blockstore_ser` structure is defined to facilitate the serialization of blocks, and several functions are declared to archive, restore, and verify block data and metadata. The functions handle tasks such as writing block data to disk, restoring it from disk, and verifying the integrity of archived metadata. This file is crucial for ensuring data integrity and efficient data management in systems that require reliable block storage and retrieval mechanisms.

# Function Declarations (Public API)

---
### fd\_blockstore\_block\_checkpt<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_blockstore_block_checkpt}} -->
Archives a block and block map entry to a file descriptor.
- **Description**: This function is used to archive a block and its associated block map entry to a specified file descriptor at the current offset in the blockstore. It is typically called when there is a need to persist block data to disk for later retrieval. The function handles necessary bookkeeping and ensures that any potential overwrites are cleared before writing. It is important to note that if the file descriptor is -1, the function will not attempt to write and will return immediately. This function returns the total size of the data written, which includes the block information, block data, and any additional serialized data.
- **Inputs**:
    - `blockstore`: A pointer to an fd_blockstore_t structure representing the blockstore context. Must not be null.
    - `ser`: A pointer to an fd_blockstore_ser_t structure containing the serialization context for the block. Must not be null and should be properly initialized with block map, block, and data pointers.
    - `fd`: An integer representing the file descriptor to which the block and block map entry will be archived. If set to -1, the function will not perform any write operations.
    - `slot`: An unsigned long integer representing the slot number associated with the block being archived. Used for logging and bookkeeping purposes.
- **Output**: Returns the total size of the data written to the file descriptor, or 0 if no write was attempted due to fd being -1.

### fd\_blockstore\_block\_info\_restore<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_blockstore_block_info_restore}} -->
Restores a block and block map entry from a file descriptor at a specified offset.
- **Description**: This function is used to restore a block and its associated block map entry from a file descriptor, using the offset specified in the block index entry. It is typically called when there is a need to retrieve archived block data, such as during a recovery process. The function requires valid pointers for the block index entry, block map entry output, and block output, and it returns an error code to indicate success or failure. It is important to ensure that the file descriptor is valid and that the block index entry contains a correct offset before calling this function.
- **Inputs**:
    - `archvr`: A pointer to an fd_blockstore_archiver_t structure, which provides the context for the archiving operation. Must not be null.
    - `fd`: An integer representing the file descriptor from which the block and block map entry will be restored. It must be a valid file descriptor.
    - `block_idx_entry`: A pointer to an fd_block_idx_t structure that specifies the offset from which to start reading the block and block map entry. Must not be null and should contain a valid offset.
    - `block_info_out`: A pointer to an fd_block_info_t structure where the restored block map entry will be stored. Must not be null.
    - `block_out`: A pointer to an fd_block_t structure where the restored block will be stored. Must not be null.
- **Output**: Returns an integer error code indicating the success or failure of the operation. A successful operation returns FD_BLOCKSTORE_SUCCESS.

### fd\_blockstore\_block\_data\_restore<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_blockstore_block_data_restore}} -->
Reads block data from a file descriptor into a buffer.
- **Description**: This function is used to restore block data from a file descriptor into a provided buffer. It is essential to ensure that the buffer is large enough to hold the data being read, as specified by `data_sz`. The function will return an error if the buffer size is insufficient or if there is an issue with seeking or reading from the file descriptor. This function is typically used in scenarios where block data needs to be retrieved from storage for further processing or analysis.
- **Inputs**:
    - `archvr`: A pointer to an `fd_blockstore_archiver_t` structure, which provides context for the blockstore operations. Must not be null.
    - `fd`: An integer representing the file descriptor from which the block data will be read. It should be a valid, open file descriptor.
    - `block_idx_entry`: A pointer to an `fd_block_idx_t` structure that specifies the offset for the block data within the file. Must not be null.
    - `buf_out`: A pointer to a buffer where the block data will be stored. The buffer must be allocated by the caller and must be large enough to hold `data_sz` bytes.
    - `buf_max`: An unsigned long indicating the maximum size of `buf_out`. It must be greater than or equal to `data_sz`.
    - `data_sz`: An unsigned long specifying the size of the data to be read from the file descriptor. It must not exceed `buf_max`.
- **Output**: Returns an integer status code: `FD_BLOCKSTORE_SUCCESS` on success, `FD_BLOCKSTORE_ERR_SLOT_MISSING` if seeking fails, or -1 if the buffer is too small.

### fd\_blockstore\_archiver\_verify<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_blockstore_archiver_verify}} -->
Checks the validity of archive metadata against blockstore constraints.
- **Description**: Use this function to verify that the archive metadata associated with a blockstore is valid. It checks specific constraints on the metadata's head, tail, and maximum file descriptor size against the blockstore's expected values. This function is useful for ensuring that the metadata is correctly initialized and consistent with the blockstore's configuration. It should be called whenever there is a need to validate the integrity of the archive metadata before performing operations that depend on it.
- **Inputs**:
    - `blockstore`: A pointer to an fd_blockstore_t structure representing the blockstore. Must not be null. The blockstore should be properly initialized before calling this function.
    - `archiver`: A pointer to an fd_blockstore_archiver_t structure containing the archive metadata to be verified. Must not be null. The metadata should be initialized and populated with relevant data before verification.
- **Output**: Returns true if the archive metadata is invalid according to the specified constraints, otherwise returns false.

### fd\_blockstore\_archiver\_lrw\_slot<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_blockstore_archiver_lrw_slot}} -->
Reads a block meta object from a file descriptor and returns the slot number.
- **Description**: This function is used to read a block meta object from a specified file descriptor and retrieve the associated slot number. It is particularly useful in scenarios where block metadata needs to be restored from persistent storage. The function should be called when a valid blockstore is available, and the file descriptor is ready for reading. If the block index is empty, the function returns a null slot indicator. The function also updates the provided block information and block output structures with the restored data.
- **Inputs**:
    - `blockstore`: A pointer to an fd_blockstore_t structure representing the blockstore context. Must not be null.
    - `fd`: An integer representing the file descriptor from which the block meta object is read. If set to -1, no read operation is performed.
    - `lrw_block_info`: A pointer to an fd_block_info_t structure where the block meta information will be stored. Must not be null.
    - `lrw_block_out`: A pointer to an fd_block_t structure where the block data will be stored. Must not be null.
- **Output**: Returns the slot number associated with the block meta object. If the block index is empty, returns FD_SLOT_NULL.
- **See also**: [`fd_blockstore_archiver_lrw_slot`](fd_blockstore_archive.c.driver.md#fd_blockstore_archiver_lrw_slot)  (Implementation)
