# Purpose
This C header file defines a set of constants representing various error types and codes used in a runtime executor, likely for a blockchain or smart contract platform. The file categorizes errors into instruction errors, system errors, and precompile errors, each with specific codes indicating different failure scenarios, such as invalid arguments, insufficient funds, or unauthorized actions. The constants are defined using preprocessor macros, providing a standardized way to handle and identify errors within the executor's operations. Additionally, the file includes comments indicating areas for improvement, such as ensuring consistent serialization with external systems and clarifying the use of certain success codes. Overall, this file serves as a centralized repository for error handling definitions, facilitating robust error management in the executor's runtime environment.
