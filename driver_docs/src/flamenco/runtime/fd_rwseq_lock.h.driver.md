# Purpose
This C header file defines a specialized read-write lock mechanism, `fd_rwseq_lock`, which is designed to facilitate concurrent read and write operations with sequence number tracking. The primary structure, `fd_rwseq_lock_t`, combines a traditional read-write lock (`fd_rwlock_t`) with a sequence number (`seqnum`) to manage and track the state of concurrent operations. The sequence number is used to detect changes during concurrent reads, ensuring data consistency and integrity. The file provides a set of inline functions for creating, joining, leaving, and deleting these locks, as well as for starting and ending read and write operations. Additionally, it includes functions specifically for handling concurrent reads, which involve checking the sequence number to ensure that the data being read has not been modified during the operation.

The code is intended to be included in other C source files, as indicated by the use of include guards and the absence of a `main` function. It provides a narrow but crucial functionality focused on synchronization in concurrent programming environments. The functions are designed to be efficient, with operations like memory fences (`FD_COMPILER_MFENCE()`) ensuring proper memory ordering. This header file does not define a public API in the traditional sense but rather offers a specialized utility for internal use within a larger system, likely related to the "flamenco" runtime environment, as suggested by the file path and included headers.

# Data Structures

### fd\_rwseq\_lock
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `rwlock`: A read-write lock used to manage concurrent access to shared resources.
    - `seqnum`: A volatile unsigned integer used to track the sequence number for synchronization purposes.
- **Description**: The `fd_rwseq_lock` structure is a custom data structure designed to facilitate synchronized access to shared resources in a concurrent programming environment. It combines a read-write lock (`fd_rwlock_t`) with a sequence number (`seqnum`) to provide a mechanism for managing both exclusive and shared access to resources. The structure is aligned to 64 bytes to optimize performance on certain hardware architectures. The sequence number is used to detect changes in the state of the lock, allowing for efficient concurrent read operations by ensuring that readers can detect when a write operation has occurred. This structure is particularly useful in scenarios where high concurrency and low contention are expected, as it allows multiple readers to access the resource simultaneously while ensuring that writers have exclusive access.

### fd\_rwseq\_lock\_t
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `rwlock`: An instance of fd_rwlock_t used to manage read-write locking.
    - `seqnum`: A volatile unsigned integer used to track the sequence number for concurrent operations.
- **Description**: The `fd_rwseq_lock_t` structure is a custom data type designed to facilitate read-write locking with an additional sequence number mechanism for managing concurrent reads. It combines a traditional read-write lock (`fd_rwlock_t`) with a sequence number (`seqnum`) to ensure data consistency during concurrent read operations. The sequence number is incremented during write operations to signal changes, allowing readers to detect modifications and retry if necessary. This structure is aligned to 64 bytes to optimize performance on modern hardware architectures.
