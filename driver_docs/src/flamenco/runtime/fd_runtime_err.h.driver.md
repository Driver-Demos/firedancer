# Purpose
This C header file defines a set of preprocessor macros representing error codes related to the execution of runtime operations, specifically focusing on transaction processing within a system. The file begins by defining two general execution status codes: one for successful execution and another for a generic error. It then enumerates a comprehensive list of transaction-specific error codes, each associated with a unique negative integer value, which describe various failure scenarios such as account issues, insufficient funds, signature problems, and execution restrictions. These error codes are likely used throughout the system to standardize error handling and reporting, facilitating consistent and clear communication of transaction processing outcomes. The use of preprocessor directives ensures that these definitions are included only once, preventing redefinition errors during compilation.
