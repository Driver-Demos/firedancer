# Purpose
This C header file defines a data structure and associated functions for managing information about a batch of microblocks, which are likely used in a blockchain or distributed ledger context. The `fd_microblock_batch_info` structure contains fields for counting various elements such as microblocks, signatures, transactions, and accounts, as well as pointers to detailed microblock information and raw batch data. The file includes function prototypes for creating, joining, leaving, and deleting instances of this structure, suggesting a lifecycle management approach for handling microblock batch data. The inclusion of other headers indicates dependencies on utility functions and specific microblock and transaction structures, which are likely defined elsewhere in the codebase. Overall, this header facilitates the organization and manipulation of microblock batch data within a larger system.

### fd\_microblock\_batch\_info\_new
- **Type**: `function pointer`
- **Description**: The `fd_microblock_batch_info_new` is a function that initializes a new microblock batch information structure in the provided memory space. It is designed to set up the necessary data structures for managing microblock batches, which include counts of microblocks, signatures, transactions, and accounts, as well as pointers to detailed microblock information and raw batch data.
- **Use**: This function is used to allocate and initialize a `fd_microblock_batch_info_t` structure in a given memory location.


---
### fd\_microblock\_batch\_info\_join
- **Type**: `fd_microblock_batch_info_t *`
- **Description**: The `fd_microblock_batch_info_join` is a function that returns a pointer to a `fd_microblock_batch_info_t` structure. This structure is used to manage information about a batch of microblocks, including counts of microblocks, signatures, transactions, and accounts, as well as pointers to detailed microblock information and raw batch data.
- **Use**: This function is used to initialize and return a pointer to a `fd_microblock_batch_info_t` structure from a given memory location.


---
### fd\_microblock\_batch\_info\_leave
- **Type**: `function pointer`
- **Description**: The `fd_microblock_batch_info_leave` is a function that takes a pointer to a `fd_microblock_batch_info_t` structure as its parameter and returns a void pointer. This function is likely used to perform cleanup or disassociation tasks related to the `fd_microblock_batch_info_t` structure.
- **Use**: This function is used to leave or disassociate from a `fd_microblock_batch_info_t` structure, potentially freeing resources or performing necessary cleanup.


---
### fd\_microblock\_batch\_info\_delete
- **Type**: `function pointer`
- **Description**: The `fd_microblock_batch_info_delete` is a function pointer that takes a void pointer as an argument and returns a void pointer. It is part of a set of functions that manage the lifecycle of `fd_microblock_batch_info_t` structures, which encapsulate information about a batch of microblocks, including counts of microblocks, signatures, transactions, and accounts, as well as pointers to detailed microblock information and raw batch data.
- **Use**: This function is used to delete or clean up resources associated with a `fd_microblock_batch_info_t` structure.
