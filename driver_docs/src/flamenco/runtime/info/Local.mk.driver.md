# Purpose
This is a Makefile snippet that conditionally includes header files and object files in the build process if the macro `FD_HAS_INT128` is defined. It uses custom functions `add-hdrs` and `add-objs` to add specific header files and an object file related to runtime block, instruction, and microblock information to the build configuration.
