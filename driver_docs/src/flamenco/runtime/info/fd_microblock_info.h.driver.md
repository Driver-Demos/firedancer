# Purpose
This C header file defines a data structure and associated function prototypes for managing microblock information within a software system, likely related to blockchain or distributed ledger technology. The `fd_microblock_info` structure encapsulates details about a microblock, including a union for accessing the microblock header or raw data, and fields for signature count, account count, raw microblock size, and a pointer to transactions. The file also declares four function prototypes for creating, joining, leaving, and deleting instances of `fd_microblock_info`, which suggests a lifecycle management pattern for handling these structures in memory. The inclusion of other headers indicates dependencies on foundational and transactional components, hinting at a modular design where this header plays a role in the broader context of microblock processing.
# Imports and Dependencies

- `../../fd_flamenco_base.h`
- `../../../ballet/block/fd_microblock.h`
- `../../../ballet/txn/fd_txn.h`
- `../../../disco/pack/fd_microblock.h`


# Global Variables

---
### fd\_microblock\_info\_new
- **Type**: `function pointer`
- **Description**: The `fd_microblock_info_new` is a function pointer that returns a void pointer. It is designed to initialize or allocate a new `fd_microblock_info` structure using the provided memory pointer `mem`. This function is part of a set of operations for managing `fd_microblock_info` structures, which are used to handle microblock information in the system.
- **Use**: This function is used to create or initialize a new `fd_microblock_info` structure from a given memory block.


---
### fd\_microblock\_info\_join
- **Type**: `function pointer`
- **Description**: The `fd_microblock_info_join` is a function that takes a pointer to memory (`void * mem`) and returns a pointer to a `fd_microblock_info_t` structure. This function is likely used to initialize or access a `fd_microblock_info_t` structure from a given memory location.
- **Use**: This function is used to join or access a `fd_microblock_info_t` structure from a specified memory location.


---
### fd\_microblock\_info\_leave
- **Type**: `function`
- **Description**: The `fd_microblock_info_leave` function is a global function that takes a pointer to an `fd_microblock_info_t` structure as its parameter. This function is likely responsible for handling the cleanup or disassociation of resources related to the `fd_microblock_info_t` structure, as suggested by the naming convention 'leave'.
- **Use**: This function is used to manage the lifecycle of an `fd_microblock_info_t` structure, specifically for cleanup or disassociation purposes.


---
### fd\_microblock\_info\_delete
- **Type**: `function pointer`
- **Description**: The `fd_microblock_info_delete` is a function pointer that takes a void pointer `mem` as an argument and returns a void pointer. It is part of the function prototypes related to the `fd_microblock_info` structure, which manages microblock information in the system.
- **Use**: This function is used to delete or clean up resources associated with a `fd_microblock_info` instance.


# Data Structures

---
### fd\_microblock\_info
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `microblock`: A union that can either be a pointer to a constant microblock header or a raw unsigned character pointer.
    - `signature_cnt`: An unsigned long integer representing the count of signatures in the microblock.
    - `account_cnt`: An unsigned long integer representing the count of accounts in the microblock.
    - `raw_microblock_sz`: An unsigned long integer indicating the size of the raw microblock.
    - `txns`: A pointer to an array of transactions associated with the microblock.
- **Description**: The `fd_microblock_info` structure is designed to encapsulate information about a microblock, including its header or raw data, the number of signatures and accounts it contains, the size of the raw microblock, and a pointer to its associated transactions. This structure is essential for managing and accessing microblock data within the system, providing a unified interface for handling both the header and raw data representations of a microblock.


---
### fd\_microblock\_info\_t
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `microblock`: A union containing either a pointer to a constant microblock header or a raw uchar pointer.
    - `signature_cnt`: An unsigned long integer representing the count of signatures.
    - `account_cnt`: An unsigned long integer representing the count of accounts.
    - `raw_microblock_sz`: An unsigned long integer representing the size of the raw microblock.
    - `txns`: A pointer to an array of transactions.
- **Description**: The `fd_microblock_info_t` structure is designed to encapsulate information about a microblock, including its header, the number of signatures and accounts it contains, the size of the raw microblock, and an array of transactions. The `microblock` union allows access to either a constant microblock header or a raw data pointer, providing flexibility in handling microblock data. This structure is essential for managing and processing microblock data within the system.
