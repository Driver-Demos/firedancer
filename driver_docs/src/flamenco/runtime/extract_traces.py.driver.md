# Purpose
This Python script is designed to compare and analyze trace logs from two different sources, specifically Firedancer and Solana. The script reads trace data from log files, processes them to extract relevant information, and then attempts to find the best matching traces between the two sources. The primary functionality is encapsulated in several key functions: [`read_traces_from_file`](#read_traces_from_file) reads and parses trace logs into structured data, [`check_strict_match`](#check_strict_match) verifies if two trace lines match based on specific criteria, and [`traces_diff`](#traces_diff) performs the core comparison logic to identify the closest matching traces between the two sets of logs. The script also includes functionality to cache Solana traces and output the results of the comparison, including writing matched traces to separate log files for further analysis.

The script is intended to be executed as a standalone program, as indicated by the presence of a [`main`](#main) function and the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block. It uses command-line arguments to specify the paths to the log files and the number of traces to process, making it flexible for different use cases. The script leverages regular expressions to parse trace lines and employs multiprocessing to handle potentially large datasets efficiently. Overall, this script provides a specialized tool for developers or analysts working with trace logs from Firedancer and Solana, facilitating the identification of similarities and differences in execution traces between these two systems.

# Global Variables

---
### reg\_val\_pattern
- **Type**: `Callable[[int], str]`
- **Description**: `reg_val_pattern` is a lambda function that takes an integer `x` as input and returns a formatted string. This string is a regular expression pattern that matches a 16-character hexadecimal value, with a named group `r{x}` where `x` is the input integer.
- **Use**: This variable is used to dynamically generate parts of a regular expression pattern for parsing trace lines, specifically to match and capture hexadecimal register values.


---
### trace\_line\_pattern
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: The `trace_line_pattern` is a string that defines a regular expression pattern used to match and extract information from lines of trace data. It captures instruction count (`ic`), program counter (`pc`), and instruction details (`instr`), along with register values (`r0` to `r10`) formatted as 16-character hexadecimal numbers. The pattern is dynamically constructed using the `reg_val_pattern` function to insert register value patterns into the main regex.
- **Use**: This variable is used to compile a regular expression that matches specific trace line formats for further processing and analysis.


---
### fast\_trace\_line\_pattern
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: The `fast_trace_line_pattern` is a regular expression pattern defined as a raw string. It is used to match lines in a log file that contain trace information, specifically capturing the instruction count (`ic`) and program counter (`pc`) values. The pattern is designed to be a simplified version of a more detailed trace line pattern, focusing on essential components for quick matching.
- **Use**: This variable is used to quickly match and extract key components from trace lines in log files during the trace reading process.


---
### trace\_start\_line\_pattern
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: The `trace_start_line_pattern` is a regular expression pattern defined as a raw string. It is used to match lines in a trace log that start with zero, potentially preceded by spaces. This pattern is useful for identifying the beginning of a new trace in a log file.
- **Use**: This variable is used to detect the start of a new trace in a log file by matching lines that begin with zero.


---
### trace\_line\_regex
- **Type**: `re.Pattern`
- **Description**: The `trace_line_regex` is a compiled regular expression pattern used to match and extract information from lines of trace data. It is based on the `trace_line_pattern`, which is a complex pattern designed to capture various components of a trace line, including instruction count, register values, program counter, and instruction details.
- **Use**: This variable is used to match and parse trace lines in the `read_traces_from_file` and `check_strict_match` functions.


# Functions

---
### read\_traces\_from\_file<!-- {{#callable:firedancer/src/flamenco/runtime/extract_traces.read_traces_from_file}} -->
The `read_traces_from_file` function reads and parses trace lines from a log file, grouping them into traces based on a specific pattern and returning a list of these traces.
- **Inputs**:
    - `log_path`: The file path to the log file from which traces are to be read.
    - `max_traces`: The maximum number of traces to read and process from the log file.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize empty lists `traces` and `trace` to store the parsed traces and the current trace, respectively.
    - Record the start time for performance measurement using `time.time()`.
    - Open the log file specified by `log_path` for reading.
    - Iterate over each line in the log file.
    - Use a regular expression to match each line against `fast_trace_line_pattern`.
    - If the number of traces reaches `max_traces`, break out of the loop.
    - If a line does not match the pattern, continue to the next line.
    - Extract named groups from the matched line using `groupdict()`.
    - Check if the instruction count (`ic`) is '0' and the current trace is not empty; if so, append the current trace to `traces`, reset `trace`, and print progress.
    - Append the current line and its matched groups to the `trace` list.
    - After the loop, if `trace` is not empty, append it to `traces`.
    - Calculate the total time taken for reading and parsing the traces.
    - Print the total trace time and the number of traces read to standard error.
- **Output**: A list of traces, where each trace is a list of tuples containing the line and its matched groups.

### check\_strict\_match<!-- {{#callable:firedancer/src/flamenco/runtime/extract_traces.check_strict_match}} -->
The `check_strict_match` function compares two trace lines to ensure they match exactly based on specific register and instruction count keys.
- **Inputs**:
    - `fd_line`: A string representing a trace line from the Firedancer log.
    - `sl_line`: A string representing a trace line from the Solana log.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Use the regular expression `trace_line_pattern` to match and extract data from `fd_line` and `sl_line`.
    - Store the match results in `fd_strict_match` and `sl_strict_match` respectively.
    - Iterate over a predefined list of keys: `['r0', 'r1', 'r2', 'r3', 'r4', 'r5', 'r6', 'r7', 'r8', 'r9', 'r10', 'ic']`.
    - For each key, compare the corresponding values in `fd_strict_match` and `sl_strict_match`.
    - If any value differs, return `False`.
    - If all values match, return `True`.
- **Output**: A boolean value indicating whether the two trace lines match exactly based on the specified keys.


---
### traces\_diff<!-- {{#callable:firedancer/src/flamenco/runtime/extract_traces.traces_diff}} -->
The `traces_diff` function compares traces from two sources, identifying and logging the best matches between them.
- **Inputs**:
    - `fd_traces`: A list of traces from the Firedancer log, where each trace is a list of tuples containing a line and its matched groups.
    - `sl_traces`: A list of traces from the Solana log, where each trace is a list of tuples containing a line and its matched groups.
    - `skip_traces`: An integer indicating the number of initial traces in the Solana log to skip during comparison.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize a set `used_sl_idxs` to track used Solana trace indices and a counter `n_good_matches` for good matches.
    - Iterate over each trace in `fd_traces` with its index `fd_idx`.
    - For each `fd_trace`, initialize `best_n_matches` and `best_sl_idx` to track the best match found.
    - Iterate over each trace in `sl_traces` with its index `sl_idx`, skipping indices less than `skip_traces` or already used indices.
    - For each pair of `fd_trace` and `sl_trace`, compare lines based on the 'pc' value and strict matching using [`check_strict_match`](#check_strict_match).
    - Update `best_n_matches` and `best_sl_idx` if a better match is found, and break if a perfect match is achieved.
    - If no match is found for a `fd_trace`, print 'NO MATCH' and continue to the next trace.
    - If a match is found, log the match details, write the matched traces to log files, and update `used_sl_idxs` and `n_good_matches`.
    - After processing all traces, print the total number of traces and good matches.
- **Output**: The function outputs log files for each Firedancer trace and its best matching Solana trace, and prints match statistics to the console.
