# Purpose
The provided content is a Makefile, which is a build automation tool used to manage the compilation and linking of a software project. This Makefile uses conditional statements to include headers and object files based on the presence of certain features or libraries, such as `FD_HAS_INT128`, `FD_HAS_SECP256K1`, `FD_HAS_ATOMIC`, and `FD_HAS_ROCKSDB`. It defines rules for adding headers and object files to the build process, and it specifies the creation and execution of unit tests for various components, such as `test_blockstore`, `test_txncache`, and `test_system_ids`. The Makefile also includes conditional logic to handle optional features, ensuring that the build process adapts to the available environment and dependencies. This setup facilitates modular and flexible compilation, allowing the software to be built with different configurations based on the system's capabilities and the project's requirements.
