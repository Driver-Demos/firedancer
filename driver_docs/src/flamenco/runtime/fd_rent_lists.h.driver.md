# Purpose
The provided code is a C header file, `fd_rent_lists.h`, which defines a set of inline functions for managing rent partitions in a blockchain context, specifically for the Solana network. The primary purpose of this file is to offer APIs that facilitate the organization and retrieval of rent-paying account addresses into sorted buckets, known as rent partitions. These partitions are used to efficiently manage and access accounts that are subject to rent fees, a feature that is planned for removal when rent collection is disabled on the Solana mainnet.

The file includes three main functions: [`fd_rent_partition_width`](#fd_rent_partition_width), [`fd_rent_key_to_partition`](#fd_rent_key_to_partition), and [`fd_rent_partition_to_key`](#fd_rent_partition_to_key). The [`fd_rent_partition_width`](#fd_rent_partition_width) function calculates the width of each rent partition based on the number of slots per epoch, ensuring that partitions are evenly distributed. The [`fd_rent_key_to_partition`](#fd_rent_key_to_partition) function determines the partition index for a given public key, allowing for quick identification of which partition a key belongs to. Lastly, [`fd_rent_partition_to_key`](#fd_rent_partition_to_key) computes the lower bound of the public key range for a specified partition and optionally provides the last key in that partition. These functions are designed to be efficient and are implemented as static inline functions to minimize overhead, making them suitable for high-performance applications in a blockchain environment.

# Functions

---
### fd\_rent\_partition\_width<!-- {{#callable:fd_rent_partition_width}} -->
The `fd_rent_partition_width` function calculates the width of a rent partition based on the number of slots per epoch.
- **Inputs**:
    - `slots_per_epoch`: The number of slots in each epoch, represented as an unsigned long integer.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if `slots_per_epoch` is equal to 1 using the `FD_UNLIKELY` macro; if true, return `ULONG_MAX`.
    - If `slots_per_epoch` is not 1, calculate the partition width using the formula `(ULONG_MAX - slots_per_epoch + 1UL) / slots_per_epoch + 1UL` and return the result.
- **Output**: The function returns an unsigned long integer representing the width of a rent partition, or `ULONG_MAX` if `slots_per_epoch` is 1.


---
### fd\_rent\_key\_to\_partition<!-- {{#callable:fd_rent_key_to_partition}} -->
The `fd_rent_key_to_partition` function calculates the partition index for a given public key based on partition width and count.
- **Inputs**:
    - `pubkey`: A pointer to an `fd_pubkey_t` structure representing the public key whose partition index is to be determined.
    - `part_width`: An unsigned long integer representing the width of each partition.
    - `part_cnt`: An unsigned long integer representing the total number of partitions.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Extract the first element of the public key as a big-endian unsigned long integer.
    - Convert the extracted big-endian value to host byte order using `fd_ulong_bswap`.
    - If there is only one partition (`part_cnt == 1`), return 0 as the partition index.
    - If the key is zero, return 0 as the partition index.
    - Calculate the partition index by dividing the key by the partition width.
    - Use `fd_ulong_if` to ensure the partition index does not exceed the maximum partition count, adjusting it if necessary.
    - Return the calculated partition index.
- **Output**: The function returns an unsigned long integer representing the partition index for the given public key.


---
### fd\_rent\_partition\_to\_key<!-- {{#callable:fd_rent_partition_to_key}} -->
The function `fd_rent_partition_to_key` calculates the starting key of a rent partition and optionally provides the last key of the partition.
- **Inputs**:
    - `partition_idx`: The index of the partition for which the key range is being calculated.
    - `part_width`: The width of each partition, determining the range of keys it covers.
    - `part_cnt`: The total number of partitions.
    - `opt_last_key`: A pointer to a ulong where the function can store the last key of the partition, if not NULL.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize two variables, `key0` and `key1`, to store the lower and upper bounds of the key range.
    - Check if `part_cnt` is less than or equal to 1; if true, set `key0` to 0 and `key1` to `ULONG_MAX`, indicating a single partition covering the entire range.
    - If `part_cnt` is greater than 1, calculate `key0` as `partition_idx * part_width`.
    - Determine `key1` using a conditional function `fd_ulong_if`; if `partition_idx` is the last partition (`partition_idx == part_cnt - 1`), set `key1` to `ULONG_MAX`, otherwise set it to `key0 + part_width - 1`.
    - If `opt_last_key` is not NULL, store `key1` in the location pointed to by `opt_last_key`.
    - Return `key0` as the lower bound of the partition's key range.
- **Output**: The function returns the lower bound (inclusive) of the key range for the specified partition.
