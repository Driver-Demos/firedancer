# Purpose
This file is a Makefile snippet used for conditional compilation. It checks if the macro `FD_HAS_INT128` is defined, and if so, it adds headers and object files related to `fd_leaders` and `fd_flamenco`, sets up a unit test named `test_leaders` with dependencies on `fd_flamenco`, `fd_ballet`, and `fd_util`, and executes the unit test `test_leaders`.
