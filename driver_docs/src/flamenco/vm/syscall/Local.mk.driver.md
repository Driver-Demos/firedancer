# Purpose
The provided content is from a Makefile, which is a build automation tool used to manage the build process of software projects. This specific section of the Makefile is conditional, executing only if the macros `FD_HAS_INT128`, `FD_HAS_HOSTED`, and `FD_HAS_SECP256K1` are defined. Within these conditions, it adds specific header files and object files related to virtual machine (VM) syscalls, indicating that these components are part of the build process when the conditions are met. Additionally, it defines and runs unit tests for various VM syscall functionalities, such as CPI, curve, and general syscalls, ensuring that these components are tested for correctness. The use of `fd_flamenco`, `fd_ballet`, and `fd_util` suggests these are libraries or modules that the tests depend on, highlighting the modular nature of the software's architecture.
