# Purpose
The provided C code defines a static jump table named `interp_jump_table` for an sBPF (sandboxed Berkeley Packet Filter) interpreter. This table is an array of pointers, where each index corresponds to an opcode that can be executed by the interpreter. The primary purpose of this jump table is to facilitate efficient opcode dispatching by using computed gotos, a technique that allows the program to jump directly to the code associated with a specific opcode. This approach is often used in interpreters to improve performance by reducing the overhead of traditional switch-case statements.

The jump table consists of 256 entries, corresponding to the possible byte values of opcodes. Each entry in the table is either a label for a valid opcode handler (e.g., `&&OPCODE(0x04)`) or a label for an invalid opcode handler (`&&sigill`). The `OPCODE` macro is used to map valid opcodes to their respective handler labels, while invalid opcodes are directed to the `sigill` label, which likely handles illegal instruction exceptions. This setup is crucial for the interpreter's operation, as it ensures that only valid opcodes are executed, while invalid ones are caught and handled appropriately. The code does not define public APIs or external interfaces, as it is intended to be a part of the internal implementation of an sBPF interpreter.
# Global Variables

---
### interp\_jump\_table
- **Type**: `static void const *[256]`
- **Description**: The `interp_jump_table` is a static array of 256 constant pointers, each pointing to a label in the code. It serves as a jump table for an interpreter, where each index corresponds to an opcode that can be executed. Invalid opcodes are directed to the `sigill` label, which likely handles illegal instruction cases.
- **Use**: This variable is used to map opcodes to their corresponding execution labels in an interpreter.
