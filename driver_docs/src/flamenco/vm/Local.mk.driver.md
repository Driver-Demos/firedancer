# Purpose
The provided content is from a Makefile, which is used to automate the build process of a software project. This particular Makefile snippet is conditional, executing only if the macros `FD_HAS_INT128`, `FD_HAS_HOSTED`, and `FD_HAS_SECP256K1` are defined. It organizes the compilation of headers and object files related to a virtual machine (VM) component, as indicated by the `fd_vm` prefix. The file uses custom functions like `add-hdrs` and `add-objs` to include headers and compile object files, respectively, and it specifies dependencies such as `fd_flamenco`, `fd_funk`, and `fd_ballet`. Additionally, it defines targets for building binaries and running unit tests, ensuring that the VM and its associated tools are correctly compiled and tested, with specific attention to the `SECP256K1_LIBS` library for cryptographic operations.
