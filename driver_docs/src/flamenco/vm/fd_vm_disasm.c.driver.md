# Purpose
This C source code file provides functionality for disassembling a virtual machine's instruction set, specifically for a system using the Solana Berkeley Packet Filter (SBPF) instruction set. The file includes functions that convert binary instructions into human-readable assembly-like text, which is useful for debugging and understanding the behavior of compiled programs. The primary function, [`fd_vm_disasm_program`](#fd_vm_disasm_program), processes a sequence of instructions, identifies function and label boundaries, and outputs the disassembled instructions with appropriate labels and function names. It handles various instruction classes such as load, store, arithmetic logic unit (ALU), and jump instructions, each with specific handling logic to ensure accurate disassembly.

The file defines several static functions, each responsible for disassembling specific types of instructions, such as [`fd_vm_disasm_instr_alu`](#fd_vm_disasm_instr_alu) for ALU operations and [`fd_vm_disasm_instr_jmp`](#fd_vm_disasm_instr_jmp) for jump operations. These functions utilize a helper function, [`fd_vm_disasm_printf`](#fd_vm_disasm_printf), to format and append the disassembled instruction strings to an output buffer. The code also includes error handling to manage buffer overflows and invalid instructions, returning specific error codes when issues are encountered. The use of macros, such as `OUT_PRINTF`, simplifies repetitive error-checking tasks. Overall, this file is a specialized utility for converting SBPF bytecode into a more understandable format, aiding developers in program analysis and debugging.

# Functions

### fd\_vm\_disasm\_printf<!-- {{#callable:fd_vm_disasm_printf}} -->
The `fd_vm_disasm_printf` function appends formatted output to a buffer, ensuring it does not exceed the buffer's maximum size, and returns a status code indicating success or specific errors.
- **Inputs**:
    - `buf`: A character buffer where the formatted output will be appended.
    - `max`: The maximum size of the buffer `buf`.
    - `_len`: A pointer to an unsigned long that indicates the current length of the string in `buf` and will be updated with the new length after appending.
    - `fmt`: A format string similar to those used in `printf` functions, specifying how the subsequent arguments are formatted.
    - `...`: A variable number of arguments to be formatted according to `fmt`.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize `len` with the current length of the string in `buf` and calculate the remaining space `rem` in the buffer.
    - Start processing the variable arguments using `va_start` and format them into the buffer using `vsnprintf`, starting at the current end of the string and using the remaining space.
    - Check if `vsnprintf` returned a negative value, indicating a parse error, and if so, terminate the string at the current length and return `FD_VM_ERR_IO`.
    - Calculate the length of the appended string and check if it exceeds the remaining space, indicating truncation, and if so, terminate the string at the maximum length minus one and return `FD_VM_ERR_FULL`.
    - If no errors occurred, update the length pointer with the new length of the string and return `FD_VM_SUCCESS`.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer status code: `FD_VM_SUCCESS` for success, `FD_VM_ERR_FULL` if the buffer was too small to hold the formatted output, or `FD_VM_ERR_IO` if there was a format parse error.

    - `_out_len`: A pointer to an unsigned long that tracks the current length of the string in the `out` buffer.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Determine the operation name based on the `op_mode` field of the instruction's opcode.
    - If the operation mode is `NEG`, format the output string with the operation name, suffix, and destination register, then return success.
    - If the source mode is immediate, format the output string with the operation name, suffix, destination register, and immediate value, then return success.

### fd\_vm\_disasm\_printf<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_vm_disasm_printf}} -->
Appends formatted output to a buffer with length tracking.
- **Description**: This function appends formatted output to a buffer, updating the length of the content in the buffer. It is designed to be used when you need to append formatted strings to an existing buffer while keeping track of the buffer's current length. The function ensures that the buffer is null-terminated even in error cases. It should be called with a valid buffer, a maximum size for the buffer, a pointer to the current length of the buffer, and a format string followed by additional arguments as required by the format. The function handles cases where the buffer is too small to hold the formatted output by truncating the output and returning an error code.
- **Inputs**:
    - `buf`: A pointer to the buffer where the formatted output will be appended. Must not be null and should have a size of at least 'max' bytes.
    - `max`: The maximum number of bytes the buffer can hold. Must be greater than zero.
    - `_len`: A pointer to the current length of the string in the buffer. Must not be null and should initially be in the range [0, max). The value is updated to reflect the new length after appending.
    - `fmt`: A format string as in printf, specifying how to format the additional arguments. Must not be null.
    - `...`: Additional arguments as required by the format string.
- **Output**: Returns FD_VM_SUCCESS on success, FD_VM_ERR_FULL if the buffer is too small, or FD_VM_ERR_IO if there is a format parsing error. The buffer is always null-terminated.
