# Purpose
This source code file is a comprehensive test suite designed to evaluate the condition logic of jump instructions within a virtual machine (VM). The file systematically tests various jump operations, such as "jump if equal" (jeq), "jump if greater than" (jgt), "jump if greater or equal" (jge), "jump if bitwise AND not zero" (jset), "jump if not equal" (jne), "jump if signed greater than" (jsgt), "jump if signed greater or equal" (jsge), "jump if less than" (jlt), "jump if less or equal" (jle), "jump if signed less than" (jslt), and "jump if signed less or equal" (jsle). Each test case specifies the operation code (op), destination register (dst), source register (src), offset (off), and immediate value (imm), along with expected outcomes such as "ok" for successful execution, "err" for errors, and "vfy" for verification errors.

The file is structured to cover a wide range of scenarios, including edge cases like out-of-bounds jumps, spin loops, and sign extension issues. It uses a specific oracle, denoted as "vfy/ok/err," to determine whether the VM correctly evaluates the jump conditions. The tests are designed to ensure that the VM handles both register-to-register and register-to-immediate comparisons accurately, taking into account various data representations and potential pitfalls like maximum and minimum values. This thorough testing approach helps in identifying and rectifying logical errors in the VM's jump instruction handling.

Overall, this file serves as a critical component in validating the robustness and correctness of the VM's jump instruction logic. By covering a broad spectrum of conditions and edge cases, it ensures that the VM can reliably execute conditional jumps, which are fundamental to control flow in programming. The file is not an executable or a library but rather a collection of test cases intended to be run within a testing framework to verify the VM's behavior.
