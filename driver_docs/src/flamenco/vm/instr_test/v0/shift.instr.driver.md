# Purpose
The provided content appears to be a configuration or test data file for a software component that deals with bitwise operations, specifically left shift operations on 32-bit and 64-bit registers. The file is structured to test various scenarios of left shift operations, using both immediate values and register values as shift amounts. Each line represents a test case, specifying the operation code (`op`), destination register (`dst`), source register (`src`), offset (`off`), initial register values, and the expected result after the operation. The file includes both valid operations, marked with `: ok`, and invalid operations, marked with `: vfy`, which likely stand for verification of expected failures. This file is crucial for validating the correctness and robustness of the bitwise operation handling in the codebase, ensuring that the software behaves as expected under various conditions and edge cases.
# Content Summary
The provided content appears to be a configuration or metadata file that describes a series of operations, likely for a virtual machine or a low-level assembly-like language. The operations are primarily left shift operations (`lsh`) on 32-bit and 64-bit registers, with both immediate and register-based shift values. The file is structured in a tabular format, with each line representing a distinct operation.

Key components of each operation include:
- **Operation Code (`op`)**: This indicates the type of operation being performed. For example, `op=64` and `op=6c` are used for 32-bit left shifts with immediate and register values, respectively, while `op=67` is used for 64-bit left shifts with immediate values.
- **Destination Register (`dst`)**: The register where the result of the operation is stored.
- **Source Register (`src`)**: The register from which the value is taken for the operation.
- **Offset (`off`)**: This may indicate a memory or instruction offset, though its specific role is not detailed in the content.
- **Initial Register Value (`rX`)**: The initial value of the register before the operation is applied.
- **Immediate Value (`imm`)**: For operations involving immediate values, this specifies the constant value used in the shift operation.
- **Result (`ok` or `vfy`)**: Indicates whether the operation was successful (`ok`) or if it requires verification (`vfy`). The `vfy` tag is used for operations that are invalid or require further validation, such as those with invalid source or destination registers.

The operations are organized into three main categories:
1. **32-bit Left Shift with Immediate (`lsh32 reg, imm`)**: These operations use a 32-bit register and an immediate value for the shift. The result is stored in the destination register, and the operation is marked as `ok` if successful.
2. **32-bit Left Shift with Register (`lsh32 reg, reg`)**: These operations use a 32-bit register and another register for the shift value. The result is stored in the destination register.
3. **64-bit Left Shift with Immediate (`lsh64 reg, imm`)**: These operations use a 64-bit register and an immediate value for the shift. The result is stored in the destination register.

The file also includes comments that provide additional context, such as `# zero` and `# truncate upper`, which describe the expected behavior or outcome of specific operations. Invalid operations are marked with `vfy`, indicating they need verification or are not valid due to issues like invalid source or destination registers.

Overall, this file serves as a detailed specification of operations for a low-level processing environment, providing essential information for developers working with this system to understand how data is manipulated at the register level.
