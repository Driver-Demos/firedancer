# Purpose
This source code file is a comprehensive test suite designed to evaluate the condition logic of jump instructions within a virtual machine (VM). The file systematically tests various jump operations, such as "jump if equal" (jeq), "jump if greater than" (jgt), "jump if greater or equal" (jge), "jump if bitwise AND not zero" (jset), "jump if not equal" (jne), "jump if signed greater than" (jsgt), "jump if signed greater or equal" (jsge), "jump if less than" (jlt), "jump if less or equal" (jle), "jump if signed less than" (jslt), and "jump if signed less or equal" (jsle). Each test case specifies the operation code (op), destination register (dst), source register (src), offset (off), and immediate value (imm), along with expected outcomes such as "ok" for successful execution, "err" for errors, and "vfy" for verification errors.

The file is structured to cover a wide range of scenarios, including edge cases like out-of-bounds jumps, spin loops, and sign extension issues. It uses a specific oracle, denoted as "vfy/ok/err," to determine whether the VM correctly evaluates the jump conditions. The tests are designed to ensure that the VM handles both successful and erroneous conditions appropriately, providing a robust validation of the VM's jump instruction logic. This file is not an executable or a library but rather a collection of test cases intended to be run within a testing framework to verify the correctness of the VM's jump instruction handling.

Overall, this file serves as a critical component in ensuring the reliability and correctness of the VM's execution of jump instructions. By covering a broad spectrum of conditions and potential pitfalls, it helps developers identify and rectify issues in the VM's logic, contributing to the stability and robustness of the software.
