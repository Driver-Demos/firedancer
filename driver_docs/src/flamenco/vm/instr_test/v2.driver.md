## Files
- **[bitwise.instr](v2/bitwise.instr.driver.md)**: The `bitwise.instr` file in the `firedancer` codebase contains test cases for various bitwise operations, including OR and AND operations on 32-bit and 64-bit registers with both immediate values and other registers, as well as validation checks for invalid source and destination registers.
- **[int_math.instr](v2/int_math.instr.driver.md)**: The `int_math.instr` file in the `firedancer` codebase contains a series of test instructions for integer arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and remainder calculations for both 32-bit and 64-bit registers, with various scenarios such as overflow, underflow, and invalid operations.
- **[jump.instr](v2/jump.instr.driver.md)**: The `jump.instr` file in the `firedancer` codebase tests various jump instruction conditions in a virtual machine, using an oracle to verify correct evaluation of jump conditions, including scenarios like jumping to itself, the next instruction, or out of bounds.
- **[load.instr](v2/load.instr.driver.md)**: The `load.instr` file in the `firedancer` codebase contains test instructions for various load operations in a virtual machine, including byte, halfword, word, and doubleword loads, with verification and error handling for invalid operations.
- **[opcode.instr](v2/opcode.instr.driver.md)**: The `opcode.instr` file in the `firedancer` codebase defines a set of opcodes with their corresponding operations and status, such as `ok`, `vfy`, and `err`, for a virtual machine instruction set.
- **[shift.instr](v2/shift.instr.driver.md)**: The `shift.instr` file in the `firedancer` codebase contains test cases for left shift operations on 32-bit and 64-bit registers, using both immediate and register values, with validation for various scenarios including invalid operations.
