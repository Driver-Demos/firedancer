# Purpose
This C header file defines utility functions and constants for testing a virtual machine (VM) in the context of the Flamenco project. It includes necessary dependencies such as `fd_vm.h`, `fd_exec_instr_ctx.h`, and `fd_valloc.h`, which suggest that it interacts with VM execution contexts and memory allocation utilities. The file defines a macro `TEST_VM_REJECT_CALLX_R10_FEATURE_PREFIX` for a specific feature prefix and sets a default SBPF version with `TEST_VM_DEFAULT_SBPF_VERSION`. It declares three functions: [`test_vm_minimal_exec_instr_ctx`](#test_vm_minimal_exec_instr_ctx) for creating a minimal execution instruction context, [`test_vm_exec_instr_ctx_delete`](#test_vm_exec_instr_ctx_delete) for deleting an execution instruction context, and [`test_vm_clear_txn_ctx_err`](#test_vm_clear_txn_ctx_err) for clearing transaction context errors. These utilities are likely used to facilitate testing and managing VM execution states and contexts.

### test\_vm\_minimal\_exec\_instr\_ctx
- **Type**: `function pointer`
- **Description**: The `test_vm_minimal_exec_instr_ctx` is a function that returns a pointer to an `fd_exec_instr_ctx_t` structure. It takes three parameters: a `fd_valloc_t` type for memory allocation, a pointer to an `fd_exec_epoch_ctx_t` structure, and a pointer to an `fd_exec_slot_ctx_t` structure. This function is likely used to initialize or configure an execution instruction context for a virtual machine test environment.
- **Use**: This function is used to create and return a minimal execution instruction context for testing purposes in a virtual machine environment.

### test\_vm\_minimal\_exec\_instr\_ctx<!-- {{#callable_declaration:test_vm_minimal_exec_instr_ctx}} -->
Create and initialize a minimal execution instruction context for a virtual machine.
- **Description**: This function sets up a minimal execution instruction context for a virtual machine using the provided memory allocator and context structures. It is intended for scenarios where only basic features are needed. The function must be called with valid memory allocation and context structures, and it returns a pointer to the initialized instruction context. If any allocation or initialization fails, the function returns NULL. This function is useful for setting up a test or minimal environment for executing instructions in a virtual machine.
- **Inputs**:
    - `valloc`: A memory allocator used to allocate memory for the instruction context. It must be capable of handling the required alignment and footprint for the context structures.
    - `epoch_ctx`: A pointer to an epoch context structure that will be used to initialize the instruction context. It must not be null and should be properly initialized before calling this function.
    - `slot_ctx`: A pointer to a slot context structure that will be used to initialize the instruction context. It must not be null and should be properly initialized before calling this function.
- **Output**: Returns a pointer to the initialized execution instruction context, or NULL if initialization fails.
- **See also**: [`test_vm_minimal_exec_instr_ctx`](test_vm_util.c.driver.md#test_vm_minimal_exec_instr_ctx)  (Implementation)

### test\_vm\_exec\_instr\_ctx\_delete<!-- {{#callable_declaration:test_vm_exec_instr_ctx_delete}} -->
Deletes an execution instruction context and frees associated memory.
- **Description**: Use this function to properly delete an execution instruction context and free the memory allocated for it and its associated transaction context. This function should be called when the execution instruction context is no longer needed, ensuring that all resources are released. It is important to ensure that the context and allocator provided are valid and that the context has been properly initialized before calling this function.
- **Inputs**:
    - `ctx`: A pointer to the execution instruction context to be deleted. Must not be null and should point to a valid, initialized context.
    - `valloc`: The memory allocator used to free the context and its associated transaction context. Must be a valid allocator capable of freeing the memory previously allocated for these contexts.
- **Output**: None
- **See also**: [`test_vm_exec_instr_ctx_delete`](test_vm_util.c.driver.md#test_vm_exec_instr_ctx_delete)  (Implementation)


---
### test\_vm\_clear\_txn\_ctx\_err<!-- {{#callable_declaration:test_vm_clear_txn_ctx_err}} -->
Clears the transaction context error state.
- **Description**: Use this function to reset the error state of a transaction context to indicate no error. It should be called when you need to clear any previous error conditions in the transaction context, typically before reusing or reinitializing the context for a new transaction. This function must be called with a valid transaction context pointer, and it does not perform any error checking on the input.
- **Inputs**:
    - `txn_ctx`: A pointer to a transaction context structure (`fd_exec_txn_ctx_t`). Must not be null. The function assumes the pointer is valid and does not perform null checks.
- **Output**: None
- **See also**: [`test_vm_clear_txn_ctx_err`](test_vm_util.c.driver.md#test_vm_clear_txn_ctx_err)  (Implementation)
