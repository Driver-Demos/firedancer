# Purpose
This C source code file is designed to import and process runtime capture data from JSON files, specifically for a system that appears to handle financial or blockchain-related data, as suggested by the use of terms like "bank preimage" and "accounts." The code reads JSON files from a specified directory, decodes Base58 and Base64 encoded data, and writes the processed information to an output file using a custom writer. The file includes several key components: a command-line interface for specifying input and output paths and options, functions for reading and parsing JSON files, and functions for decoding and processing specific data structures such as bank preimages and account information. The code also manages memory allocation using custom allocators and handles errors robustly with logging.

The file is structured as an executable program, with a [`main`](#main) function that orchestrates the overall process. It sets up the environment, parses command-line arguments, and manages resources such as memory and file handles. The program uses several external libraries and headers, including custom ones like `fd_flamenco.h` and `fd_solcap_writer.h`, as well as standard libraries for file and directory operations. The code is modular, with functions dedicated to specific tasks such as reading JSON files, unmarshalling data, and writing output, which enhances maintainability and readability. The use of custom memory management and logging functions indicates a focus on performance and reliability, which is crucial for applications dealing with potentially large datasets and critical financial information.

# Global Variables

---
### current\_alloc
- **Type**: `fd_alloc_t *`
- **Description**: `current_alloc` is a static pointer to an `fd_alloc_t` structure, which represents a custom memory allocator. It is used to manage memory allocation and deallocation within the program, particularly in conjunction with the `cJSON` library for JSON parsing.
- **Use**: This variable is used to set the current memory allocator for the `my_malloc` and `my_free` functions, which are then used by the `cJSON` library to allocate and free memory.


# Functions

---
### usage<!-- {{#callable:usage}} -->
The `usage` function prints the usage instructions for the `fd_solcap_import` command to the standard error stream.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function calls `fprintf` to print a multi-line usage message to `stderr`, detailing the command syntax and available options.
    - The function returns 0, indicating successful execution.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer value of 0, indicating successful execution.


---
### my\_malloc<!-- {{#callable:my_malloc}} -->
The `my_malloc` function allocates memory of a specified size using a custom allocator.
- **Inputs**:
    - `sz`: The size in bytes of the memory to allocate.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function calls `fd_alloc_malloc` with the current allocator, a fixed alignment of 1, and the specified size `sz`.
    - The result of `fd_alloc_malloc` is returned as the allocated memory pointer.
- **Output**: A pointer to the allocated memory block, or NULL if the allocation fails.


---
### my\_free<!-- {{#callable:my_free}} -->
The `my_free` function deallocates memory pointed to by the given pointer using the current memory allocator.
- **Inputs**:
    - `p`: A pointer to the memory block that needs to be deallocated.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function calls `fd_alloc_free` with `current_alloc` and the pointer `p` to free the allocated memory.
- **Output**: The function does not return any value.


---
### read\_json\_file<!-- {{#callable:read_json_file}} -->
The `read_json_file` function reads a JSON file from a specified path, parses its content into a cJSON object, and returns the parsed JSON object.
- **Inputs**:
    - `wksp`: A pointer to a workspace object (`fd_wksp_t`) used for memory allocation.
    - `alloc`: A pointer to an allocator object (`fd_alloc_t`) used for custom memory allocation hooks.
    - `path`: A constant character pointer representing the file path of the JSON file to be read.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize custom memory allocation hooks for cJSON using the provided allocator.
    - Open the file at the specified path in read-only mode.
    - Check if the file was opened successfully; if not, log a warning and return NULL.
    - Retrieve the file size using `fstat`; if it fails, log a warning, close the file, and return NULL.
    - Allocate a buffer in the workspace to store the file content based on the file size; if allocation fails, log a warning, close the file, and return NULL.
    - Read the file content into the allocated buffer in a loop until all content is read; handle read errors by logging a warning, closing the file, and returning NULL.
    - Parse the buffer content into a cJSON object using `cJSON_ParseWithLength`.
    - Free the allocated buffer and close the file.
    - Return the parsed cJSON object.
- **Output**: A pointer to a cJSON object representing the parsed JSON content of the file, or NULL if an error occurred during the process.
