# Purpose
The provided C header file defines the structure and constants for a data capture format named "solcap," which is used for capturing and replaying Solana runtime data. This format is designed to facilitate debugging and analysis by organizing data into a portable file format that includes a file header, a series of chunks, and associated metadata. Each chunk contains a header and a serialized Protobuf object, allowing for flexible schema evolution while maintaining fixed-size structures for efficient navigation. The file and chunk headers include magic numbers to identify the type of data they contain, such as account information or bank pre-images, and the file is structured to support sequential reading with random access within chunks.

The header file defines several key structures, such as `fd_solcap_fhdr_t` for the file header and `fd_solcap_chunk_t` for chunk headers, along with constants for identifying different chunk types and their respective Protobuf metadata sizes. It also includes hardcoded limits for various components, such as the maximum size of Protobuf structures and the number of entries in the account table. The use of Protobufs allows for easy schema updates, while fixed-size headers ensure efficient file navigation. This header file is intended to be included in other C source files that implement the functionality for reading, writing, or processing solcap files, providing a clear and structured approach to handling Solana runtime data captures.

# Data Structures

---
### fd\_solcap\_fhdr
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `magic`: A unique identifier for the file header, expected to be FD_SOLCAP_V1_NULL_MAGIC.
    - `chunk0_foff`: The offset of the first chunk from the beginning of the stream.
    - `meta_sz`: The size of the metadata Protobuf object.
    - `_pad14`: Padding to align the structure, consisting of three unused uints.
- **Description**: The `fd_solcap_fhdr` structure represents the file header of a capture file in the Solana capture (solcap) format. It contains essential information for navigating the file, including a magic number to identify the file type, an offset to the first data chunk, and the size of the metadata stored as a Protobuf object. The structure is designed to facilitate the reading and processing of Solana runtime data for debugging and replay purposes, with padding included to ensure proper alignment.


---
### fd\_solcap\_fhdr\_t
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `magic`: A magic number used to identify the file type, expected to be FD_SOLCAP_V1_NULL_MAGIC.
    - `chunk0_foff`: The offset of the first chunk from the beginning of the stream.
    - `meta_sz`: The size of the metadata Protobuf object following the header.
    - `_pad14`: Padding to align the structure to a 16-byte boundary.
- **Description**: The `fd_solcap_fhdr_t` structure represents the file header of a capture file in the Solana capture data format, known as 'solcap'. It contains essential information for identifying the file type and locating the first data chunk within the file. The header includes a magic number for file type identification, an offset to the first chunk, and the size of the metadata Protobuf object that follows the header. The structure is padded to ensure proper alignment.


---
### fd\_solcap\_chunk\_t
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `magic`: A unique identifier for the chunk type.
    - `total_sz`: The total size of the chunk including the header and data.
    - `meta_coff`: The offset from the chunk header to the metadata.
    - `meta_sz`: The size of the metadata following the chunk header.
    - `_pad18`: Padding to align the structure to a 32-byte boundary.
- **Description**: The `fd_solcap_chunk_t` structure represents the fixed-size header of a chunk in the Solana capture file format, known as 'solcap'. Each chunk begins with this header, which contains essential information such as the chunk's type (`magic`), its total size (`total_sz`), and metadata offsets and sizes (`meta_coff` and `meta_sz`). This structure is followed by a serialized Protobuf blob that contains chunk-specific information, allowing for flexible and extensible data representation. The padding (`_pad18`) ensures proper alignment for efficient data access.


---
### fd\_solcap\_account\_tbl
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `key`: An array of 32 unsigned characters representing the account address.
    - `hash`: An array of 32 unsigned characters representing the account hash, a leaf of the accounts delta accumulator.
    - `acc_coff`: A long integer indicating the chunk offset to the account chunk.
    - `_pad48`: An array of three unsigned long integers used for padding.
- **Description**: The `fd_solcap_account_tbl` structure represents an entry in the table of accounts that were changed in a block within the Solana capture data format. It includes a key for the account address, a hash for the account's state, and a chunk offset pointing to the account's data within the capture file. The structure is designed to facilitate efficient navigation and access to account data changes, and it is typically used in conjunction with Protobuf-serialized metadata for detailed account information.


---
### fd\_solcap\_account\_tbl\_t
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `key`: A 32-byte array representing the account address.
    - `hash`: A 32-byte array representing the account hash, which is a leaf of the accounts delta accumulator.
    - `acc_coff`: A long integer indicating the chunk offset to the account chunk.
    - `_pad48`: An array of three unsigned long integers used for padding.
- **Description**: The `fd_solcap_account_tbl_t` structure represents an entry in the table of accounts that were changed in a block within the Solana runtime data capture format. It includes fields for the account's address (`key`), its hash (`hash`), and the chunk offset to the account's data (`acc_coff`). The structure is designed to facilitate the organization and retrieval of account-related data, and it is ideally sorted to match the order of accounts in the accounts delta vector.


# Functions

---
### fd\_solcap\_is\_chunk\_magic<!-- {{#callable:fd_solcap_is_chunk_magic}} -->
The function `fd_solcap_is_chunk_magic` checks if a given magic number corresponds to a null chunk in the solcap data format.
- **Inputs**:
    - `magic`: An unsigned long integer representing the magic number of a chunk to be checked.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function performs a bitwise AND operation between the input `magic` and the constant `FD_SOLCAP_V1_MAGIC_MASK`.
    - It then compares the result of the bitwise operation to the constant `FD_SOLCAP_V1_NULL_MAGIC`.
    - If the result matches `FD_SOLCAP_V1_NULL_MAGIC`, the function returns true (non-zero); otherwise, it returns false (zero).
- **Output**: The function returns an integer indicating whether the input magic number is a null chunk magic (1 for true, 0 for false).
