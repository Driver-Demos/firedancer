# Purpose
The provided content is from a Makefile, which is a build automation tool used to manage the build process of software projects. This particular section of the Makefile is responsible for conditionally adding headers and object files, as well as creating binary executables based on certain conditions. The `ifdef` directives check for the presence of specific features or configurations, such as `FD_HAS_INT128` and `FD_HAS_HOSTED`, to determine which files and binaries should be included in the build process. The `$(call add-hdrs,...)` and `$(call add-objs,...)` functions are used to add header and object files, respectively, while `$(call make-bin,...)` is used to create executable binaries. This setup allows for a flexible and conditional build process, adapting to different environments or configurations.
