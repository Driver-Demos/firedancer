# Purpose
This code is an automatically generated C source file that defines constant bindings for Protocol Buffers (protobuf) messages using the nanopb library. It includes the header file "fd_solcap.pb.h" and checks for compatibility with a specific version of the nanopb generator, ensuring that the file is regenerated if the version does not match. The file uses the `PB_BIND` macro to create bindings for several protobuf message types, such as `fd_solcap_FileMeta`, `fd_solcap_BankPreimage`, `fd_solcap_AccountTableMeta`, `fd_solcap_AccountMeta`, and `fd_solcap_Transaction`. These bindings facilitate the serialization and deserialization of these message types, enabling efficient data exchange in applications that use the nanopb library for handling Protocol Buffers.
