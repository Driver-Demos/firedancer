# Purpose
This C source code file is an executable program designed to read and process binary data files, specifically for dumping the contents of an account in a structured format. The program is named `fd_solcap_dump` and it operates by taking command-line arguments to specify the type of data and the file to be processed. The code includes functionality for handling command-line arguments, setting up a workspace with memory allocation, reading the specified file into memory, and decoding the file's contents based on the specified data type. The decoded data is then processed and output in a YAML format using the `fd_flamenco_yaml` library, which suggests that the program is part of a larger system dealing with data serialization and deserialization.

The code is structured around several key components: command-line argument parsing, memory management using a scratch allocator, file I/O operations, and data decoding and output. It utilizes several external libraries, such as `fd_flamenco`, `fd_types`, and `fd_types_yaml`, indicating that it is part of a broader software ecosystem. The program defines a public interface through its command-line options, allowing users to specify the input file and data type, which are crucial for its operation. The use of functions like `fd_wksp_new_anonymous` and `fd_scratch_alloc` highlights the program's focus on efficient memory management, while the decoding and YAML output functionality underscores its role in data processing and presentation.

# Functions

---
### usage<!-- {{#callable:usage}} -->
The `usage` function prints the usage instructions for the `fd_solcap_dump` command to the standard error stream.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function calls `fprintf` to print a formatted string to `stderr`.
    - The printed message includes the command usage syntax and options available for the `fd_solcap_dump` command.
- **Output**: The function does not return any value; it outputs a formatted usage message to the standard error stream.


---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function initializes the environment, processes command-line arguments, reads a specified file, decodes its contents based on a given type, and outputs the decoded data in YAML format.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments passed to the program.
    - `argv`: An array of strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize the environment using `fd_boot` and `fd_flamenco_boot`.
    - Iterate over command-line arguments to check for the `--help` flag and display usage information if found.
    - Extract command-line options for page size, page count, scratch memory size, type, and file using `fd_env_strip_cmdline_cstr` and `fd_env_strip_cmdline_ulong`.
    - Check if `type` or `file` is NULL and display usage information if so, then exit.
    - Convert the page size string to an unsigned long using `fd_cstr_to_shmem_page_sz`.
    - Create a new anonymous workspace with the specified page size and count using `fd_wksp_new_anonymous`.
    - Allocate scratch memory within the workspace and attach it using `fd_scratch_attach`.
    - Open the specified file, read its contents into a scratch buffer, and close the file.
    - Initialize a decode context with the file data and allocate memory for the decoded data.
    - Look up the type's virtual table using `fd_types_vt_by_name` and check for errors.
    - Calculate the total size needed for decoding using the type's `decode_footprint` method.
    - Decode the file data into the allocated memory using the type's `decode` method.
    - Walk through the decoded data and output it in YAML format using `fd_flamenco_yaml_walk`.
    - Clean up by popping the scratch memory, detaching it, and halting the environment.
- **Output**: The function returns 0 on successful execution or an error code if a failure occurs during decoding.
