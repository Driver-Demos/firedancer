# Purpose
This Makefile snippet is used to automate the build process for a software component named "fd_flamenco." It defines the creation of a library, adds header files, and specifies object files for compilation. Additionally, it conditionally includes and runs a unit test for "test_flamenco" if the macro `FD_HAS_ALLOCA` is defined.
