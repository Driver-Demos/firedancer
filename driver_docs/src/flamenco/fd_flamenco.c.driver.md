# Purpose
This C source code file defines two functions, [`fd_flamenco_boot`](#fd_flamenco_boot) and [`fd_flamenco_halt`](#fd_flamenco_halt), which are currently implemented as no-operations (no-ops). The [`fd_flamenco_boot`](#fd_flamenco_boot) function takes two parameters, `pargc` and `pargv`, which are pointers typically used for command-line argument handling, but they are marked as unused with the `__attribute__((unused))` directive, indicating that they are not utilized within the function. The comments suggest that these functions were previously necessary for handling custom format string specifiers, but since their removal, the functions remain as placeholders for potential future use. This file serves as a template or a stub for initialization and cleanup routines that might be needed later, ensuring that the function signatures and calls are already in place if such functionality is required.
# Imports and Dependencies

# Functions

---
### fd\_flamenco\_boot<!-- {{#callable:fd_flamenco_boot}} -->
The `fd_flamenco_boot` function is a placeholder function that currently performs no operations but is retained for potential future use.
- **Inputs**:
    - `pargc`: An integer pointer representing the argument count, marked as unused.
    - `pargv`: A pointer to a pointer to a character array representing the argument vector, marked as unused.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function is defined but does not perform any operations, as indicated by the comment explaining the removal of custom format string specifiers.
    - The function is retained as a no-op (no operation) for potential future use if the need for boot/halt functionality arises.
- **Output**: The function does not produce any output or perform any operations.


---
### fd\_flamenco\_halt<!-- {{#callable:fd_flamenco_halt}} -->
The `fd_flamenco_halt` function is a placeholder function that currently performs no operations.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function is defined with no parameters and an empty body, indicating it performs no actions.
- **Output**: The function does not produce any output or perform any operations.
