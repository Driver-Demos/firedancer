# Purpose
This C source code file is designed to manage and query a mapping of type descriptors, specifically using a virtual table (vt) approach. The code provides a mechanism to retrieve type information based on a name, which is a common pattern in systems that require dynamic type reflection or type introspection. The core functionality is encapsulated in the function [`fd_types_vt_by_name`](#fd_types_vt_by_name), which searches for a type descriptor by its name and returns a pointer to the corresponding virtual table entry. This function is crucial for systems that need to dynamically resolve types at runtime, such as serialization frameworks or plugin architectures.

The code utilizes a static array `fd_types_map` to store the type descriptors, and it initializes this map using a one-time setup pattern (`FD_ONCE_BEGIN` and `FD_ONCE_END`) to ensure that the map is populated only once during the program's execution. This initialization involves iterating over a list of type descriptors (`fd_types_vt_list`) and inserting them into the map. The use of macros like `FD_UNLIKELY` and `FD_LOG_ERR` suggests that the code is optimized for performance and includes error handling for potential issues, such as the map being too small to accommodate all type descriptors. This file is likely part of a larger library or framework that provides type reflection capabilities, and it is intended to be used as an internal component rather than a standalone executable.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `fd_types_reflect_private.h`


# Global Variables

---
### fd\_types\_map
- **Type**: `fd_types_vt_t array`
- **Description**: The `fd_types_map` is a global array of type `fd_types_vt_t`, which is used to store type information for a set of types. The size of the array is determined by the macro `FD_TYPES_MAP_LG_SLOT_CNT`, which defines the number of slots in the map as a power of two. This array is used to map type names to their corresponding type information structures.
- **Use**: This variable is used to store and retrieve type information based on type names, facilitating type reflection operations.


---
### key
- **Type**: `fd_types_vt_key_t`
- **Description**: The variable `key` is an instance of the `fd_types_vt_key_t` structure, which is initialized with a name and its length. This structure is used to represent a key for querying a map of type descriptors.
- **Use**: The `key` variable is used to query the `fd_types_map` for a type descriptor that matches the given name and length.


# Functions

---
### fd\_types\_vt\_by\_name<!-- {{#callable:fd_types_vt_by_name}} -->
The function `fd_types_vt_by_name` retrieves a type descriptor from a map based on a given name and its length.
- **Inputs**:
    - `name`: A constant character pointer representing the name of the type to be queried.
    - `name_len`: An unsigned long integer representing the length of the name.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function uses a macro `FD_ONCE_BEGIN` to ensure that the initialization block is executed only once.
    - Within the initialization block, a map is created by joining a new map instance, and then a loop iterates over a list of type descriptors (`fd_types_vt_list`).
    - For each type descriptor in the list, an entry is inserted into the map using the descriptor's key.
    - If the insertion fails, an error is logged indicating that the map's slot count is too small.
    - The initialization block ends with `FD_ONCE_END`.
    - The function checks if `name_len` is zero or exceeds `USHORT_MAX`, returning `NULL` if true.
    - A key is created using the provided name and name length, and the map is queried with this key.
    - The result of the query is returned.
- **Output**: A pointer to a `fd_types_vt_t` structure representing the type descriptor if found, or `NULL` if the name length is invalid or the descriptor is not found.
