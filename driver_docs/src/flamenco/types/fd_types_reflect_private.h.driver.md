# Purpose
This C header file is designed to facilitate the mapping and lookup of types by name within a software system, likely part of a larger project involving type reflection or dynamic type handling. It defines a map API using macros to configure a hash map, specifically tailored for managing types, with a focus on comparing and hashing type names. The file includes a set of macros that define the characteristics of the map, such as the number of slots (`FD_TYPES_MAP_LG_SLOT_CNT`), the type of the map (`fd_types_vt_t`), and the key comparison and hashing functions. Additionally, it declares an external map array (`fd_types_map`) that can be used elsewhere in the program to perform type lookups by name. This header file is a private component, as suggested by its name, and is likely intended for internal use within the module it belongs to.

### fd\_types\_map
- **Type**: `fd_types_vt_t array`
- **Description**: The `fd_types_map` is a global array of type `fd_types_vt_t` used for mapping and looking up types by their names. It is defined with a size of 2^9 (512) slots, as determined by the `FD_TYPES_MAP_LG_SLOT_CNT` macro. This map is part of a larger system for type reflection, allowing efficient retrieval of type information based on string keys.
- **Use**: This variable is used to store and retrieve type information by name, facilitating type reflection in the system.
