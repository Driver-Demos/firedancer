# Purpose
This Makefile is used to automate tasks in a software project. It defines targets for building (`all`), cleaning (`clean`), and generating stubs (`stubs`) using Python scripts. The `stubs` target depends on `fd_types.json` and executes Python scripts to generate code from header files, facilitating code maintenance and testing.
