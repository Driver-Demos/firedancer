# Purpose
This C source code file is a test script designed to validate the behavior of the `fd_rust_cast_double_to_ulong` function, which appears to convert `double` values to `unsigned long` integers. The script initializes a variety of `double` values, including positive and negative infinity, NaN (Not-a-Number), a negative number, a positive number, and the maximum possible `unsigned long` value, as well as a value slightly exceeding this maximum. It then uses the `FD_TEST` macro to assert that the function correctly handles these edge cases, ensuring that infinities and values exceeding `ULONG_MAX` are capped at `ULONG_MAX`, NaN and negative values are converted to zero, and regular positive numbers are cast accurately. The script begins and ends with calls to `fd_boot`, `fd_flamenco_boot`, `fd_flamenco_halt`, and `fd_halt`, which likely handle initialization and cleanup processes for the testing environment.

# Functions

---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function initializes the environment, tests the conversion of various double values to unsigned long integers, and then shuts down the environment.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The count of command-line arguments passed to the program.
    - `argv`: An array of strings representing the command-line arguments passed to the program.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Call `fd_boot` and `fd_flamenco_boot` to initialize the environment with command-line arguments.
    - Define several double precision floating-point variables representing special values like infinity, negative infinity, NaN, negative numbers, positive numbers, and maximum unsigned long values.
    - Use `FD_TEST` to assert that the function `fd_rust_cast_double_to_ulong` correctly converts these double values to unsigned long integers, checking for expected results such as `ULONG_MAX` for infinity and zero for NaN and negative values.
    - Call `fd_flamenco_halt` and `fd_halt` to cleanly shut down the environment.
    - Return 0 to indicate successful execution.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer value of 0, indicating successful execution.
