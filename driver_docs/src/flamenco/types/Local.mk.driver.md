# Purpose
The provided content is from a Makefile, which is a build automation tool used to manage the compilation and testing of software projects. This Makefile snippet is designed to conditionally compile and test components of a software project based on the presence of certain features, such as `FD_HAS_INT128` and `FD_HAS_HOSTED`. It includes directives to add header files and object files, create unit tests, and run these tests for various components like `fd_types_meta`, `fd_types_yaml`, and `fd_types_fixtures`. Additionally, it specifies the creation of a library `fd_flamenco_test` and includes a fuzz test for `fuzz_types_decode` if the `FD_HAS_HOSTED` feature is enabled. The file also references Protobuf definitions for "ConfirmedBlock," indicating integration with protocol buffer serialization.
