# Purpose
The provided content is a YAML configuration file that appears to define network-related metadata for a node in a distributed system, likely a blockchain or peer-to-peer network. The `pull_resp` section contains a public key (`pubkey`) and a list of contact information (`crds`) for the node. Each entry in the `crds` list includes a `signature` and detailed `data` about the node's network interfaces and ports for various services such as gossip, transaction validation (tvu), transaction forwarding (tvu_fwd), repair, transaction processing (tpu), voting (tpu_vote), and remote procedure calls (rpc). The IP addresses are set to localhost (127.0.0.1), indicating a local or test environment setup. Additional metadata includes a `wallclock` timestamp and a `shred_version`, which may be used for synchronization and compatibility purposes within the network.
