# Purpose
The file content is a pattern used in a `.gitignore` file to specify files that should be ignored by Git version control. It instructs Git to ignore any files with the extension `.actual.` in their filenames, regardless of the file's prefix or suffix, preventing them from being tracked or committed to the repository.
