# Purpose
The provided content is a YAML configuration file that appears to define a response structure for a pull request in a distributed system. It includes a public key (`pubkey`) and a list of change request data structures (`crds`), each containing a signature and associated metadata such as version information (`version_v2`) with fields for version numbers, a wallclock timestamp, and a feature set identifier. This file is likely used to manage and verify versioning and updates within the system.
