# Purpose
The provided C header file defines the structure and functions related to handling YAML data within the context of the "flamenco" module. It introduces a data type, `fd_flamenco_yaml_t`, which is designed to manage YAML data with specific functionalities such as alignment, footprint calculation, initialization, and deletion. The structure includes a file pointer and arrays for managing indentation, which suggests that it is used for parsing or generating YAML content with a focus on maintaining proper formatting.

This header file is part of a larger codebase, as indicated by its inclusion of a base header file (`fd_flamenco_base.h`) and its adherence to a virtual class interface (`fd_flamenco_walk_fn_t`). The functions declared in this file, such as [`fd_flamenco_yaml_new`](#fd_flamenco_yaml_new), [`fd_flamenco_yaml_delete`](#fd_flamenco_yaml_delete), and [`fd_flamenco_yaml_walk`](#fd_flamenco_yaml_walk), provide a public API for creating, initializing, and manipulating YAML data structures. The file is intended to be included in other C source files, providing a modular approach to handling YAML data within the flamenco framework. The use of macros for defining constants like maximum indentation and buffer size further emphasizes its role in managing YAML formatting details.

# Function Declarations (Public API)

---
### fd\_flamenco\_yaml\_new<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_flamenco_yaml_new}} -->
Creates a new fd_flamenco_yaml_t object in the provided memory.
- **Description**: This function initializes a new fd_flamenco_yaml_t object using the memory provided by the caller. It should be used when you need to create a YAML object that implements the fd_flamenco_walk_fn_t interface. The function requires a valid memory pointer where the object will be constructed. If the provided memory pointer is NULL, the function will log a warning and return NULL. The memory must be large enough to hold a fd_flamenco_yaml_t object, and the caller is responsible for managing the memory's lifecycle.
- **Inputs**:
    - `mem`: A pointer to a memory block where the fd_flamenco_yaml_t object will be created. Must not be NULL. The memory block should be properly aligned and large enough to accommodate a fd_flamenco_yaml_t object. If NULL, the function logs a warning and returns NULL.
- **Output**: Returns a pointer to the newly created fd_flamenco_yaml_t object, or NULL if the input memory pointer is NULL.

Deletes a YAML object and returns its memory pointer.
- **Description**: Use this function to delete a `fd_flamenco_yaml_t` object when it is no longer needed, allowing for any associated resources to be released. This function should be called to clean up after a YAML object has been created and used, ensuring that memory is properly managed. The function returns the memory pointer of the deleted YAML object, which can be useful for further memory management tasks. It is important to ensure that the `yaml` parameter is not null before calling this function to avoid undefined behavior.
- **Inputs**:
    - `yaml`: A pointer to the `fd_flamenco_yaml_t` object to be deleted. Must not be null. The caller retains ownership of the memory and is responsible for managing it after deletion.
- **Output**: Returns the memory pointer of the deleted `fd_flamenco_yaml_t` object.

---
### fd\_flamenco\_yaml\_init<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_flamenco_yaml_init}} -->
Initialize a fd_flamenco_yaml_t object with a file handle.
- **Description**: This function initializes a fd_flamenco_yaml_t object by associating it with a file handle, which is expected to be a FILE pointer or a platform-specific equivalent. It must be called with a valid fd_flamenco_yaml_t object and a non-null file handle. If either parameter is null, the function logs a warning and returns null. This function is typically used to prepare a fd_flamenco_yaml_t object for subsequent operations that require file interaction.
- **Inputs**:
    - `yaml`: A pointer to a fd_flamenco_yaml_t object that will be initialized. Must not be null. The caller retains ownership.
    - `file`: A pointer to a file handle, expected to be a FILE pointer or a platform-specific equivalent. Must not be null. The caller retains ownership.
- **Output**: Returns the initialized fd_flamenco_yaml_t object on success, or null if either input is null.

---
### fd\_flamenco\_yaml\_file<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_flamenco_yaml_file}} -->
Retrieve the file handle from a YAML object.
- **Description**: Use this function to obtain the file handle associated with a given `fd_flamenco_yaml_t` object. This is typically used when you need to access or manipulate the file that the YAML object is associated with. Ensure that the `fd_flamenco_yaml_t` object has been properly initialized before calling this function. The function does not modify the state of the YAML object or the file handle.
- **Inputs**:
    - `yaml`: A pointer to an `fd_flamenco_yaml_t` object. This parameter must not be null, and the object should be properly initialized before use. The caller retains ownership of the object.

### fd\_flamenco\_yaml\_walk<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_flamenco_yaml_walk}} -->
Processes a YAML node and writes its representation to a file.
- **Description**: This function is used to process a node in a YAML structure and write its representation to a file associated with the `fd_flamenco_yaml_t` object. It should be called as part of a YAML serialization process, where each node is visited and processed. The function handles different data types and ensures proper indentation and formatting according to the YAML specification. It is important to ensure that the `level` parameter does not exceed `FD_FLAMENCO_YAML_MAX_INDENT - 1` to avoid warnings and potential formatting issues. The function does not process nodes of type `FD_FLAMENCO_TYPE_ENUM_DISC` and will log a critical error if an unknown type is encountered.
- **Inputs**:
    - `_self`: A pointer to an `fd_flamenco_yaml_t` object. This must not be null and should be properly initialized before calling this function. The caller retains ownership.
    - `arg`: A pointer to the data associated with the node being processed. The type of data pointed to must match the `type` parameter. The caller retains ownership.

    - `type`: An integer representing the type of the node. It must be one of the predefined types such as `FD_FLAMENCO_TYPE_MAP`, `FD_FLAMENCO_TYPE_ARR`, etc. Invalid types will result in a critical log error.
    - `type_name`: A string representing the name of the type. This parameter is not used in the function and can be null. The caller retains ownership.
    - `level`: An unsigned integer representing the indentation level of the node. It must be less than `FD_FLAMENCO_YAML_MAX_INDENT - 1`. Exceeding this limit will result in a warning and the function will return without processing the node.

It should be called whenever a YAML handler is needed, ensuring that the same instance is reused across multiple calls. This function initializes the instance if it has not been created yet, using standard output as the file handle. It is important to note that the returned instance is managed internally, and the caller should not attempt to free or delete it.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Output**: Returns a pointer to a `fd_flamenco_yaml_t` instance, which is a singleton YAML handler.
