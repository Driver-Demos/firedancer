# Purpose
This C source code file is an executable program designed to test the functionality of type classification functions related to a system called "Flamenco." The program includes a series of tests that verify whether specific types are classified correctly as primitive or collection types. It uses a set of predefined type constants, such as `FD_FLAMENCO_TYPE_NULL`, `FD_FLAMENCO_TYPE_BOOL`, and `FD_FLAMENCO_TYPE_ARR`, to check the behavior of functions like `fd_flamenco_type_is_primitive`, `fd_flamenco_type_is_collection`, `fd_flamenco_type_is_collection_begin`, and `fd_flamenco_type_is_collection_end`. These functions are likely part of a larger library or framework that deals with type management, and the tests ensure that each type is correctly identified according to its characteristics.

The program begins by initializing the environment with `fd_boot` and concludes with `fd_halt`, indicating a structured setup and teardown process typical in test suites. The use of `FD_TEST` suggests a macro or function designed to assert conditions, likely logging failures or successes. The inclusion of conditional compilation for 128-bit integer types (`FD_HAS_INT128`) indicates that the code is designed to be portable across different platforms with varying support for data types. The program logs a notice of "pass" if all tests succeed, providing a simple feedback mechanism for the user. Overall, this file serves as a validation tool to ensure the correct implementation of type classification within the Flamenco system.

# Functions

---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function initializes the program, performs a series of tests on various data types to verify their classification as primitive or collection types, and logs the results before halting the program.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: An integer representing the number of command-line arguments passed to the program.
    - `argv`: An array of strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function begins by calling `fd_boot` to initialize the program with the command-line arguments.
    - It then performs a series of tests using `FD_TEST` to check if various `FD_FLAMENCO_TYPE_*` constants are classified as primitive types using [`fd_flamenco_type_is_primitive`](fd_types_meta.h.driver.md#fd_flamenco_type_is_primitive).
    - The function checks if the same constants are classified as collection types using [`fd_flamenco_type_is_collection`](fd_types_meta.h.driver.md#fd_flamenco_type_is_collection).
    - It further tests if certain types are the beginning or end of a collection using [`fd_flamenco_type_is_collection_begin`](fd_types_meta.h.driver.md#fd_flamenco_type_is_collection_begin) and [`fd_flamenco_type_is_collection_end`](fd_types_meta.h.driver.md#fd_flamenco_type_is_collection_end).
    - If all tests pass, it logs a notice message 'pass' using `FD_LOG_NOTICE`.
    - Finally, the function calls `fd_halt` to terminate the program.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value as it is of type `int` but does not explicitly return anything; it is expected to terminate the program after logging the test results.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`fd_flamenco_type_is_primitive`](fd_types_meta.h.driver.md#fd_flamenco_type_is_primitive)
    - [`fd_flamenco_type_is_collection`](fd_types_meta.h.driver.md#fd_flamenco_type_is_collection)
    - [`fd_flamenco_type_is_collection_begin`](fd_types_meta.h.driver.md#fd_flamenco_type_is_collection_begin)
    - [`fd_flamenco_type_is_collection_end`](fd_types_meta.h.driver.md#fd_flamenco_type_is_collection_end)
