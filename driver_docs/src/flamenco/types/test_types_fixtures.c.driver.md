# Purpose
This C source code file is designed to test the encoding and decoding of data types against predefined fixtures. It primarily focuses on verifying the correctness of data serialization and deserialization processes using bincode and YAML formats. The file includes a set of test vectors, each representing a specific data type and its corresponding binary and YAML representations. These test vectors are defined using macros and are sourced from binary and YAML files located in a specified directory. The code imports these binary and YAML files into the compilation unit, allowing the tests to access the data directly.

The file defines a structure, `test_fixture_t`, which encapsulates the necessary information for each test, including the binary and YAML data, the size of the data, and function pointers for encoding and decoding operations. The main functionality is provided by two test functions: [`test_yaml`](#test_yaml) and [`test_idempotent`](#test_idempotent). [`test_yaml`](#test_yaml) checks if the decoded binary data matches the expected YAML representation, while [`test_idempotent`](#test_idempotent) ensures that the data can be decoded and then re-encoded to match the original binary data. The main function iterates over the test vectors, executing these tests and using a scratch memory area to manage temporary data. The code is structured to ensure that the serialization and deserialization processes are robust and that the data integrity is maintained across conversions.

# Functions

---
### test\_yaml<!-- {{#callable:test_yaml}} -->
The `test_yaml` function decodes a binary blob from a test fixture, encodes it into YAML format, and verifies that the resulting YAML matches the expected output.
- **Inputs**:
    - `t`: A pointer to a `test_fixture_t` structure containing the test data and functions for decoding and encoding.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize a decoding context using the binary data and size from the test fixture.
    - Check if the scratch memory is safe to prepare and allocate memory for the decoded data.
    - Decode the binary data using the `decode_footprint` function to determine the total size and check for errors.
    - Decode the binary data into the allocated memory using the `decode` function.
    - Prepare a buffer for YAML encoding and open a memory stream for writing the YAML data.
    - Initialize a YAML encoder and walk through the decoded data to generate the YAML representation.
    - Check for errors during YAML encoding and ensure the file stream is closed properly.
    - Compare the generated YAML size and content with the expected YAML from the test fixture.
    - If the YAML does not match, log a warning, dump the actual YAML to a file, and log an error.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value but logs errors and warnings if the YAML output does not match the expected result.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`fd_flamenco_yaml_init`](fd_types_yaml.c.driver.md#fd_flamenco_yaml_init)

### test\_idempotent<!-- {{#callable:test_idempotent}} -->
The `test_idempotent` function verifies that a binary-encoded data structure can be decoded and then re-encoded to match the original binary data, ensuring idempotency of the encoding/decoding process.
- **Inputs**:
    - `t`: A pointer to a `test_fixture_t` structure containing the test fixture data, including binary data, size, and function pointers for encoding and decoding operations.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if the `check_idem` flag in the test fixture is set; if not, return immediately.
    - Initialize a decoding context with the binary data from the test fixture.
    - Prepare a scratch space for decoding and decode the binary data into this space.
    - Check for decoding errors and log an error if decoding fails.
    - Prepare a scratch space for encoding and encode the decoded data back into binary format.
    - Check for encoding errors and log an error if encoding fails.
    - Compare the re-encoded binary data with the original binary data to ensure they match, logging an error if they do not.
    - If a global decode function is available, reset the decoded data, decode globally, and re-encode globally, then compare the result with the original binary data.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value but logs errors if the idempotency test fails at any stage.
