# Purpose
This C source code file is a test program designed to verify the correctness of a sequence of Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) walk instructions generated by the `fd_types_walk` function. The code defines a structure, `fd_flamenco_type_step_t`, to hold values recorded during the invocation of a callback function, `fd_types_walk_fn_t`. The main component of the code is the `fd_flamenco_walk_recorder_t` class, which provides the `fd_types_walk_fn_t` method and maintains a buffer of `fd_flamenco_type_step_t` values. The program includes a static instance of this recorder to store the sequence of steps during the AST walk, and it compares these steps against an expected sequence to ensure correctness.

The file also includes a function, [`test_vote_account_walk`](#test_vote_account_walk), which decodes a binary-encoded vote account and uses the recorder to walk through the decoded structure, capturing the sequence of steps. It then compares the recorded steps with an expected sequence to identify any mismatches, logging warnings and errors if discrepancies are found. The [`main`](#main) function initializes the necessary components, executes the test, and ensures that the scratch memory is properly managed. This code is intended to be executed as a standalone program, as indicated by the presence of the [`main`](#main) function, and it does not define public APIs or external interfaces for use by other programs.

### recorder
- **Type**: `fd_flamenco_walk_recorder_t[1]`
- **Description**: The `recorder` is a static array of one `fd_flamenco_walk_recorder_t` structure, which is used to store a sequence of Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) walk instructions. It contains a buffer of `fd_flamenco_type_step_t` values and a counter to track the number of steps recorded.
- **Use**: The `recorder` is used to capture and store the sequence of steps during the AST walk process in the `fd_flamenco_walk_recorder` function.

### vote\_account\_walk
- **Type**: ``fd_flamenco_type_step_t[]``
- **Description**: The `vote_account_walk` is a static constant array of `fd_flamenco_type_step_t` structures, which represents a predefined sequence of steps for walking through a vote account data structure. Each element in the array specifies a level, type, and optionally a name and data pointer, which together describe the hierarchical structure of the vote account.
- **Use**: This variable is used to define the expected sequence of steps for traversing a vote account, which is then compared against actual traversal steps to ensure correctness.

# Functions

---
### fd\_flamenco\_walk\_recorder<!-- {{#callable:fd_flamenco_walk_recorder}} -->
The `fd_flamenco_walk_recorder` function records a step in an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) walk by storing details of the step in a buffer within a `fd_flamenco_walk_recorder_t` structure.
- **Inputs**:
    - `_self`: A pointer to a `fd_flamenco_walk_recorder_t` structure where the step will be recorded.
    - `arg`: A constant pointer to data associated with the step being recorded.
    - `name`: A constant character pointer representing the name of the step.
    - `type`: An integer representing the type of the step.
    - `type_name`: A constant character pointer representing the name of the type, which is not used in the function.
    - `level`: An unsigned integer representing the level of the step in the AST.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function begins by casting the `_self` pointer to a `fd_flamenco_walk_recorder_t` pointer named `self`.
    - A test is performed using `FD_TEST` to ensure that the current step count (`self->step_cnt`) is less than the maximum allowed steps (`STEPS_MAX`).
    - A new `fd_flamenco_type_step_t` structure is created and initialized with the provided `level`, `type`, `name`, and `arg` values.
    - The newly created step is stored in the `steps` array at the index specified by `self->step_cnt`.
    - The `step_cnt` is incremented to reflect the addition of the new step.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it modifies the `fd_flamenco_walk_recorder_t` structure pointed to by `_self` by adding a new step to its `steps` array.

### test\_vote\_account\_walk<!-- {{#callable:test_vote_account_walk}} -->
The `test_vote_account_walk` function tests the correctness of the AST walk instructions generated by `fd_types_walk` by decoding a vote account binary blob, walking through the decoded state, and comparing the recorded steps against expected steps.
