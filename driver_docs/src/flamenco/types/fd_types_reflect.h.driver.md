# Purpose
This C header file, `fd_types_reflect.h`, provides reflection logic for type serializers used in bincode operations. It defines a virtual interface, `fd_types_vt`, which includes function pointers for creating new instances, decoding, encoding, determining size, and walking through serialized data structures. The file also declares a list, `fd_types_vt_list`, which contains entries for each supported bincode type, and a function, [`fd_types_vt_by_name`](#fd_types_vt_by_name), to retrieve a type class by its name. This setup facilitates dynamic handling and manipulation of various data types in a serialized format, allowing for flexible and efficient serialization and deserialization processes.

# Global Variables

---
### fd\_types\_vt\_list
- **Type**: `fd_types_vt_t const[]`
- **Description**: The `fd_types_vt_list` is a global array of `fd_types_vt_t` structures, each representing a virtual interface for a type serializer for supported bincode types. This array is null-terminated, indicated by a `name` field set to `NULL` in the last element.
- **Use**: This variable is used to store and provide access to the virtual interfaces for each supported bincode type, allowing for serialization and deserialization operations.


---
### fd\_types\_vt\_list\_cnt
- **Type**: `ulong`
- **Description**: The `fd_types_vt_list_cnt` is a global variable of type `ulong` that represents the count of records in the `fd_types_vt_list`. This list contains entries of type `fd_types_vt_t`, which are used for type serialization in the bincode framework.
- **Use**: This variable is used to determine the number of type serializer entries available in the `fd_types_vt_list`.


---
### fd\_types\_vt\_by\_name
- **Type**: `function pointer`
- **Description**: `fd_types_vt_by_name` is a function that returns a pointer to a constant `fd_types_vt_t` structure. This function is used to retrieve a type serializer interface based on the provided type name and its length.
- **Use**: This function is used to obtain a type serializer interface by matching the provided name and length with entries in a list of supported bincode types.


# Data Structures

---
### fd\_types\_vt\_key
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `name`: A pointer to a constant character string representing the type name, such as "vote".
    - `name_len`: An unsigned short integer representing the length of the type name.
- **Description**: The `fd_types_vt_key` structure is a simple data structure used to store metadata about a type, specifically its name and the length of the name. It is part of a larger system for type serialization and reflection, where it serves as a key component in identifying and managing different types within the system. This structure is used in conjunction with other structures and functions to facilitate the serialization and deserialization of types in a binary format.

### fd\_types\_vt\_key\_t
- **Type**: `typedef struct fd_types_vt_key fd_types_vt_key_t;`
- **Members**:
    - `name`: A constant character pointer representing the type name, such as "vote".
    - `name_len`: An unsigned short integer representing the length of the type name.
- **Description**: The `fd_types_vt_key_t` is a structure used to represent a key for a type serializer in the context of the Flamenco project's reflection logic for bincode types. It contains a type name and its length, which are used to identify and manage different types within the serialization framework. This structure is part of a larger virtual interface for type serializers, facilitating operations like encoding, decoding, and size calculation for various types.

    - `name_len`: An unsigned short indicating the length of the type name.
    - `align`: An unsigned short representing the alignment requirement of the type.
    - `hash`: An unsigned integer representing the hash value of the type.
    - `new_`: A function pointer for creating a new instance of the type.
    - `decode_footprint`: A function pointer for decoding the footprint of the type from a context.
    - `decode`: A function pointer for decoding the type from a context into an output buffer.
    - `encode`: A function pointer for encoding the type into a context.
    - `size`: A function pointer for determining the size of the type.
    - `walk`: A function pointer for walking through the type structure with a callback function.
- **Description**: The `fd_types_vt` structure is a virtual interface for type serializers, providing a set of function pointers for operations such as creating, decoding, encoding, and determining the size of a type. It includes a union for type identification, either through a key or directly with a name, alignment, and hash. This structure is part of a reflection logic system for bincode type serializers, allowing dynamic handling of various types in a flexible and extensible manner.

The structure supports reflection logic, allowing dynamic interaction with different types based on their names and properties.


# Function Declarations (Public API)

---
### fd\_types\_vt\_by\_name<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_types_vt_by_name}} -->
Retrieve a type serializer interface by its name.
- **Description**: Use this function to obtain a pointer to a type serializer interface based on the provided type name and its length. This is useful when you need to perform operations like encoding or decoding on a specific type using its associated virtual interface. The function expects the name to be a valid, null-terminated string and the length to accurately reflect the number of characters in the name. It returns a pointer to the corresponding type serializer interface if found, or NULL if no matching type is available.
- **Inputs**:
    - `name`: A pointer to a null-terminated string representing the type name. It must not be null, and the string should be valid and correctly terminated.
    - `name_len`: The length of the type name string. It should match the actual length of the string pointed to by 'name'.
- **Output**: A pointer to a constant fd_types_vt_t structure representing the type serializer interface if a match is found, or NULL if no matching type is available.
- **See also**: [`fd_types_vt_by_name`](fd_types_reflect.c.driver.md#fd_types_vt_by_name)  (Implementation)
