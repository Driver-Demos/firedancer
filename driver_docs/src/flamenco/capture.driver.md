## Files
- **[fd_solcap.pb.c](capture/fd_solcap.pb.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_solcap.pb.c` file contains automatically generated nanopb constant definitions for various data structures used in the `firedancer` codebase.
- **[fd_solcap.pb.h](capture/fd_solcap.pb.h.driver.md)**: The `fd_solcap.pb.h` file in the `firedancer` codebase defines data structures and associated metadata for capturing Solana blockchain data, including file metadata, bank preimages, account table metadata, account metadata, and transaction details, using the nanopb protocol buffer library.
- **[fd_solcap.proto](capture/fd_solcap.proto.driver.md)**: The `fd_solcap.proto` file defines protocol buffer messages for capturing Solana blockchain data, including metadata, bank preimages, account tables, account metadata, and transaction details.
- **[fd_solcap_diff.c](capture/fd_solcap_diff.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_solcap_diff.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase implements functionality to compare and analyze differences between two Solana capture files, including bank hashes, account data, and transaction results, with options for detailed output and data dumping.
- **[fd_solcap_dump.c](capture/fd_solcap_dump.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_solcap_dump.c` file is a command-line utility in the `firedancer` codebase that reads and decodes the contents of a specified account file, outputting the data in a YAML format.
- **[fd_solcap_import.c](capture/fd_solcap_import.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_solcap_import.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase implements a command-line tool for importing runtime capture directories from JSON files, processing them, and writing the data to an output file using a custom writer.
- **[fd_solcap_proto.h](capture/fd_solcap_proto.h.driver.md)**: The `fd_solcap_proto.h` file defines the "solcap" capture data format for Solana runtime data, detailing its structure, including file headers, chunk headers, and associated Protobuf metadata, for purposes such as replay and debugging.
- **[fd_solcap_reader.c](capture/fd_solcap_reader.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_solcap_reader.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase implements functions for reading and decoding Solana capture data from a file, including iterating over chunks and extracting specific metadata using Protobuf.
- **[fd_solcap_reader.h](capture/fd_solcap_reader.h.driver.md)**: The `fd_solcap_reader.h` file in the `firedancer` codebase provides functions and structures for iterating through and reading chunks of a solcap file, including handling errors and specific data retrieval like bank preimages and account tables.
- **[fd_solcap_writer.c](capture/fd_solcap_writer.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_solcap_writer.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase implements a capture writer for Solana bank hash pre-images and changed accounts, providing functions to manage file offsets, write account and bank preimage data, and handle file operations with error checking.
- **[fd_solcap_writer.h](capture/fd_solcap_writer.h.driver.md)**: The `fd_solcap_writer.h` file defines the interface for a capture writer object in the Firedancer codebase, which is responsible for writing SOLCAP_V1_BANK files, including managing memory alignment, initializing streams, and writing various components like accounts, bank preimages, and transactions.
- **[fd_solcap_writer_stub.c](capture/fd_solcap_writer_stub.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_solcap_writer_stub.c` file provides a stub implementation of the `fd_solcap_writer` for non-hosted targets, including functions for initialization, deletion, and writing operations that return default values or perform no operations.
- **[fd_solcap_yaml.c](capture/fd_solcap_yaml.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_solcap_yaml.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase provides functionality to read and process runtime capture files, converting them into YAML format with options for verbosity and filtering by slot range.
- **[Local.mk](capture/Local.mk.driver.md)**: The `Local.mk` file in the `firedancer` codebase specifies the build configuration for the `flamenco/capture` module, including header files, object files, and binary targets, with conditional logic based on the presence of `FD_HAS_INT128` and `FD_HAS_HOSTED`.
- **[solcap.sh](capture/solcap.sh.driver.md)**: The `solcap.sh` file is a Bash script in the `firedancer` codebase that wraps the `solana-ledger-tool` and `solcap` to generate and compare solcap files for debugging Solana ledgers, with options to create diffs between firedancer and solana solcap files.
