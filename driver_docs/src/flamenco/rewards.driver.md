- **[fd_rewards.c](rewards/fd_rewards.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_rewards.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase implements the logic for calculating and distributing rewards in a blockchain system, including functions for calculating inflation rates, stake points, and partitioned epoch rewards, as well as managing the distribution of these rewards to stake and vote accounts.
- **[fd_rewards.h](rewards/fd_rewards.h.driver.md)**: The `fd_rewards.h` file in the `firedancer` codebase defines structures and functions for calculating and distributing stake and vote rewards within the Flamenco runtime environment.
- **[Local.mk](rewards/Local.mk.driver.md)**: The `Local.mk` file in the `firedancer` codebase specifies conditional inclusion of headers and objects related to `fd_rewards` and `fd_flamenco` based on the presence of 128-bit integer support.
