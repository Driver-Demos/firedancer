# Purpose
This code is a C header file that provides function prototypes for initializing and terminating a module or application named "flamenco." It includes a base header file, `fd_flamenco_base.h`, suggesting that it builds upon foundational functionality defined elsewhere. The file defines two functions: [`fd_flamenco_boot`](#fd_flamenco_boot), which appears to initialize the module by potentially modifying command-line arguments, and [`fd_flamenco_halt`](#fd_flamenco_halt), which likely handles cleanup or shutdown procedures. The use of include guards ensures that the header's contents are only included once per compilation unit, preventing redefinition errors.

# Function Declarations (Public API)

---
### fd\_flamenco\_boot<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_flamenco_boot}} -->
Prepare the Flamenco system for operation.
- **Description**: This function is intended to prepare the Flamenco system for operation, although currently it performs no actions and serves as a placeholder for potential future functionality. It is designed to be called at the start of a program that uses the Flamenco system, allowing for future extensions where initialization might be necessary. The function accepts parameters that are typically used for command-line argument processing, but these are currently unused.
- **Inputs**:
    - `pargc`: A pointer to an integer representing the count of command-line arguments. This parameter is currently unused, but it should not be null if future functionality is added.
    - `pargv`: A pointer to an array of strings representing the command-line arguments. This parameter is currently unused, but it should not be null if future functionality is added.
- **Output**: None
- **See also**: [`fd_flamenco_boot`](fd_flamenco.c.driver.md#fd_flamenco_boot)  (Implementation)


---
### fd\_flamenco\_halt<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_flamenco_halt}} -->
Halts the Flamenco system.
- **Description**: Use this function to stop the Flamenco system when it is no longer needed or before shutting down the application. It should be called after the system has been initialized and used, typically as part of a clean shutdown process. Ensure that all necessary operations are completed before calling this function, as it will terminate the system's operations.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Output**: None
- **See also**: [`fd_flamenco_halt`](fd_flamenco.c.driver.md#fd_flamenco_halt)  (Implementation)
