# Purpose
The provided C code is a generated source file that defines a set of feature identifiers for a software system, likely related to a blockchain or distributed ledger technology. The file includes a large array of `fd_feature_id_t` structures, each representing a specific feature with attributes such as an index, a unique identifier (ID), a name, and flags indicating whether the feature is cleaned up, activated on all clusters, or reverted. The features cover a wide range of functionalities, including inflation mechanisms, token fixes, syscall enablement, and various optimizations and security enhancements.

The file also includes a function, [`fd_feature_id_query`](#fd_feature_id_query), which allows querying a feature by a prefix, returning a pointer to the corresponding feature ID structure. This function uses a switch-case statement to map prefixes to feature IDs, suggesting that the prefixes are used as keys for efficient lookup. Additionally, the file contains static assertions to verify the correctness of offset calculations for each feature within the `fd_features_t` structure, ensuring that the layout of the structure matches the expected design. This file is intended to be included in other parts of the software, providing a centralized definition and access point for feature management within the system.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `fd_features.h`
- `stddef.h`


# Global Variables

---
### ids
- **Type**: `array of `fd_feature_id_t``
- **Description**: The `ids` variable is a global constant array of `fd_feature_id_t` structures, each representing a feature with specific attributes such as index, id, name, cleaned_up version, and activation status across clusters. This array is used to manage and track various features within the system, providing a structured way to access feature details.
- **Use**: This variable is used to store and provide access to feature metadata, allowing the system to query and manage features efficiently.


# Functions

---
### fd\_feature\_id\_query<!-- {{#callable:fd_feature_id_query}} -->
The `fd_feature_id_query` function retrieves a pointer to a feature ID structure based on a given prefix value.
- **Inputs**:
    - `prefix`: An unsigned long integer representing the prefix value used to query the feature ID.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function uses a switch statement to match the input prefix against a set of predefined case values.
    - Each case corresponds to a specific prefix value and returns a pointer to an element in the `ids` array, which contains feature ID structures.
    - If the prefix does not match any case, the function returns NULL.
- **Output**: A pointer to a `fd_feature_id_t` structure if the prefix matches a case, otherwise NULL.
