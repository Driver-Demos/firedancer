# Purpose
The file is a Makefile snippet that defines build rules for a software project. It uses the `add-hdrs` and `add-objs` functions to include header files (`fd_features.h`, `fd_features_generated.h`) and object files (`fd_features`, `fd_features_generated`, `fd_flamenco`) in the build process, facilitating modular compilation and linking.
