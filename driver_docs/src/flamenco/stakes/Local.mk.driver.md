# Purpose
This is a Makefile snippet used for conditional compilation and build configuration. It checks for the presence of the `FD_HAS_INT128` and `FD_HAS_HOSTED` flags to conditionally add headers and objects, and to create a binary named `fd_stakes_from_snapshot` with specified dependencies. The TODO comment indicates a need to remove the dependency on `fd_funk`.
