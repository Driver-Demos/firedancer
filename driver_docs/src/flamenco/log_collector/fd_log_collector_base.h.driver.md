# Purpose
This C header file defines the foundational structure and constants for a log collector component, specifically `fd_log_collector_t`, which is part of a larger system, likely related to the "flamenco" project. The primary purpose of this file is to establish the base definition for the log collector, avoiding circular dependencies within the codebase. It sets up key parameters such as maximum log size (`FD_LOG_COLLECTOR_MAX`), additional buffer space (`FD_LOG_COLLECTOR_EXTRA`), and a protocol tag for serialization (`FD_LOG_COLLECTOR_PROTO_TAG`). These constants are crucial for managing the log data efficiently, ensuring that logs are serialized correctly, and handling potential truncation scenarios.

The `fd_log_collector` structure itself is designed to manage log data, including the size of the buffer currently in use (`buf_sz`), the total size of logs inserted (`log_sz`), and flags for truncation warnings (`warn`) and log enablement (`disabled`). The structure also includes a buffer array to store serialized log data. This file does not define any public APIs or external interfaces directly but provides the necessary groundwork for other components to implement log collection functionality. The inclusion of this header in other parts of the system would allow those components to utilize the log collector's capabilities, ensuring consistent log management across the application.
# Imports and Dependencies

- `../fd_flamenco_base.h`


# Global Variables

### FD\_PROTOTYPES\_END
- **Type**: `Macro`
- **Description**: `FD_PROTOTYPES_END` is a macro used to mark the end of a section of function prototypes or declarations in the code. It is typically paired with `FD_PROTOTYPES_BEGIN` to encapsulate a block of function prototypes, ensuring that they are properly organized and easily identifiable within the codebase.
- **Use**: This macro is used to denote the end of a block of function prototypes, aiding in code organization and readability.


# Data Structures

---
### fd\_log\_collector
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `buf_sz`: The size of the buffer currently used, including serialization overheads.
    - `log_sz`: The total byte count of logs inserted, up to a defined maximum.
    - `warn`: Indicates whether logs were truncated to match specific behavior.
    - `disabled`: Indicates whether transaction logs are disabled (1) or enabled (0).
    - `buf`: A serialized log buffer with a defined maximum size plus extra space for overhead.
- **Description**: The `fd_log_collector` structure is designed to manage and store log data with serialization overheads, ensuring compatibility with specific logging behaviors. It includes fields to track the size of the buffer in use (`buf_sz`), the total size of logs inserted (`log_sz`), and flags to indicate if logs have been truncated (`warn`) or if logging is disabled (`disabled`). The structure also contains a buffer (`buf`) that holds the serialized log data, with a maximum size defined by `FD_LOG_COLLECTOR_MAX` and additional space for serialization overheads (`FD_LOG_COLLECTOR_EXTRA`).

- **Description**: The `fd_log_collector_t` is a structure designed to manage and store log messages with serialization capabilities. It includes fields to track the size of the buffer used (`buf_sz`), the total size of logs inserted (`log_sz`), and flags to indicate if logs have been truncated (`warn`) or if logging is disabled (`disabled`). The structure also contains a buffer (`buf`) to hold the serialized log messages, with a maximum size defined by `FD_LOG_COLLECTOR_MAX` and additional space for overheads. This structure is used to ensure efficient log management and serialization, adhering to specific behavior requirements.
