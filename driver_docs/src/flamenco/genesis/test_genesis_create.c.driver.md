# Purpose
This C source code file is an executable program designed to create and configure a genesis block for a blockchain system, likely part of a larger framework or application. The code initializes a minimal configuration for the genesis block using a structure `fd_genesis_options_t`, which includes public keys for identity, faucet, stake, and vote, as well as parameters like creation time, ticks per slot, and target tick duration. The program uses a buffer to serialize the genesis block data and tests the creation process with different configurations, including adding initial accounts and feature gates. The code also manages logging levels to suppress warnings during execution and utilizes scratch memory for temporary data storage.

The file includes functions from external headers, indicating it is part of a larger codebase, possibly a blockchain framework like Firedancer. The main technical components include memory management, logging configuration, and the creation and serialization of the genesis block. The code is structured to test various configurations of the genesis block, ensuring that the creation process is robust and can handle different scenarios. The program concludes by logging a success message and cleaning up resources, indicating that it is intended for testing or demonstration purposes within the context of the larger system.
# Imports and Dependencies

- `fd_genesis_create.h`
- `../types/fd_types.h`


# Functions

---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function initializes the environment, configures genesis options, tests buffer serialization, and logs the process for a Firedancer runtime.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The count of command-line arguments passed to the program.
    - `argv`: An array of strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Call `fd_boot` to initialize the environment with command-line arguments.
    - Retrieve the current log level and set it to a minimum of 4 to suppress warning logs.
    - Attach scratch memory using `fd_scratch_attach` for temporary storage.
    - Define and initialize a `fd_genesis_options_t` structure with minimal configuration settings.
    - Test [`fd_genesis_create`](fd_genesis_create.c.driver.md#fd_genesis_create) with a NULL buffer to ensure it fails as expected when the buffer is too small.
    - Restore the original log level after the test.
    - Allocate a buffer `result_mem` and serialize the genesis options into it using [`fd_genesis_create`](fd_genesis_create.c.driver.md#fd_genesis_create), checking the result size.
    - Modify the options to include initial account funding and serialize again, checking the result size.
    - Disable all features in a `fd_features_t` structure, set a specific feature, and serialize the updated options, checking the result size.
    - Log a notice indicating the process passed.
    - Detach the scratch memory using `fd_scratch_detach`.
    - Call `fd_halt` to terminate the program.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer value of 0, indicating successful execution.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`fd_genesis_create`](fd_genesis_create.c.driver.md#fd_genesis_create)
