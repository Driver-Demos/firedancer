# Purpose
This C source code file is an executable program designed to test the functionality of a snapshot restoration system, specifically for a Solana-based environment. The code is structured to initialize a workspace and set up a context for restoring snapshots, which involves handling manifests and status caches. It includes various test cases to validate the behavior of the snapshot restoration process under different conditions, such as handling invalid parameters, rejecting invalid status caches and manifests, and managing accounts with different states and sizes. The program uses a series of macros and functions to create and manipulate snapshot restore contexts, ensuring that the restoration process adheres to expected behaviors and constraints.

The code is organized around a main function that orchestrates the setup and execution of tests, utilizing static helper functions and callback mechanisms to manage the restoration process. Key components include the initialization of a workspace, allocation of memory for restoration contexts, and the use of callback functions to handle manifests and status caches. The program also defines several macros to streamline the creation of new restore contexts and simulate different stages of the restoration process. The tests cover a wide range of scenarios, including handling empty files, undersized data, and accounts with specific attributes, ensuring the robustness and reliability of the snapshot restoration system.

# Global Variables

---
### \_cb\_retcode
- **Type**: `int`
- **Description**: The `_cb_retcode` is a static integer variable initialized to 0. It is used as a return code for callback functions in the program.
- **Use**: This variable is used to determine the return value of the `cb_manifest` and `cb_status_cache` functions, indicating the success or failure of these operations.


---
### \_cb\_v\_manifest
- **Type**: `fd_solana_manifest_t *`
- **Description**: The variable `_cb_v_manifest` is a static global pointer to an `fd_solana_manifest_t` structure, which is initially set to `NULL`. This structure is likely used to store or reference a manifest related to the Solana blockchain, as indicated by its type name.
- **Use**: This variable is used to store the manifest passed to the `cb_manifest` callback function, allowing it to be accessed globally within the file.


---
### \_cb\_v\_cache
- **Type**: `fd_bank_slot_deltas_t *`
- **Description**: The `_cb_v_cache` is a static global pointer variable of type `fd_bank_slot_deltas_t *`, which is initialized to `NULL`. It is used to store a reference to a cache of bank slot deltas, which are likely used to track changes or updates in bank slots within the context of a snapshot restore operation.
- **Use**: This variable is used to hold the cache data passed to the `cb_status_cache` callback function, allowing the program to access and manipulate bank slot deltas during snapshot restoration.


---
### \_cb\_v\_ctx
- **Type**: `void *`
- **Description**: The variable `_cb_v_ctx` is a static global pointer initialized to `NULL`. It is used to store a context pointer that is passed to callback functions.
- **Use**: This variable is used to hold the context pointer for callback functions `cb_manifest` and `cb_status_cache`, allowing them to access or modify the context as needed.


# Functions

---
### \_set\_accv\_sz<!-- {{#callable:_set_accv_sz}} -->
The function `_set_accv_sz` updates the size of an account vector in a snapshot restore context by inserting or updating a record in the account vector map.
- **Inputs**:
    - `restore`: A pointer to an `fd_snapshot_restore_t` structure, representing the snapshot restore context.
    - `slot`: An unsigned long integer representing the slot number associated with the account vector.
    - `id`: An unsigned long integer representing the identifier for the account vector.
    - `sz`: An unsigned long integer representing the size to be set for the account vector.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Create a key of type `fd_snapshot_accv_key_t` using the provided `slot` and `id`.
    - Insert the key into the account vector map of the `restore` context using `fd_snapshot_accv_map_insert`, and store the returned record pointer in `rec`.
    - Assert that the record pointer `rec` is not null using `FD_TEST`.
    - Set the `sz` field of the record pointed to by `rec` to the provided `sz` value.
    - Assert that querying the account vector map with the same key returns the same record pointer `rec` using `FD_TEST`.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it operates by side effects on the `restore` context's account vector map.


---
### cb\_manifest<!-- {{#callable:cb_manifest}} -->
The `cb_manifest` function sets global variables to store a given manifest and context, and returns a predefined return code.
- **Inputs**:
    - `ctx`: A pointer to a context object, which is stored in a global variable for later use.
    - `manifest`: A pointer to an `fd_solana_manifest_t` structure, which is stored in a global variable for later use.
    - `spad`: A pointer to an `fd_spad_t` structure, which is not used in the function.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function begins by casting the `spad` parameter to void to indicate it is unused.
    - The global variable `_cb_v_manifest` is set to the value of the `manifest` parameter.
    - The global variable `_cb_v_ctx` is set to the value of the `ctx` parameter.
    - The function returns the value of the global variable `_cb_retcode`.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer value, which is the value of the global variable `_cb_retcode`.


---
### cb\_status\_cache<!-- {{#callable:cb_status_cache}} -->
The `cb_status_cache` function sets global variables for context and cache pointers and returns a predefined static return code.
- **Inputs**:
    - `ctx`: A pointer to a context object, which is stored in a global variable for later use.
    - `cache`: A pointer to a `fd_bank_slot_deltas_t` structure, which is stored in a global variable for later use.
    - `spad`: A pointer to an `fd_spad_t` structure, which is not used in the function body.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function begins by casting the `spad` parameter to void to indicate it is unused.
    - The global variable `_cb_v_cache` is set to the value of the `cache` parameter.
    - The global variable `_cb_v_ctx` is set to the value of the `ctx` parameter.
    - The function returns the value of the static variable `_cb_retcode`.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer value, which is the value of the static variable `_cb_retcode`.

### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function initializes a workspace and context for snapshot restoration, performs various tests on snapshot restoration functionalities, and cleans up resources before exiting.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: An integer representing the number of command-line arguments.
    - `argv`: An array of strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize the environment and parse command-line arguments for page size, page count, and near CPU settings.
    - Create a new anonymous workspace and allocate memory for various components like funk, restore memory, and spad.
    - Define macros for creating new snapshot restore contexts with or without a manifest.
    - Perform a series of tests to validate snapshot restoration functionalities, including handling invalid parameters, rejecting accounts before manifest, and testing status cache and manifest handling.
    - Test various scenarios like empty files, undersized AppendVecs, and account handling, ensuring proper error handling and state transitions.
    - Clean up allocated resources and log the completion of tests before halting the program.
