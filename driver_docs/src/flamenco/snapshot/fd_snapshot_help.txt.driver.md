# Purpose
The provided content is a help message for a command-line tool named `fd_snapshot`, which is used to manage and parse Solana state snapshots. The tool offers commands such as `help` to display usage information and `dump` to parse a snapshot file, with the latter requiring a local path to a `.tar.zst` snapshot file. The `dump` command includes options for specifying the Zstandard decompression window size, outputting account metadata in CSV format, and writing a YAML serialization of the snapshot manifest. Global flags allow configuration of workspace parameters like page size and count, and there is a known bug related to workspace allocation that is pending a fix. This documentation provides users with the necessary information to utilize the tool effectively, including command syntax, options, and current limitations.
