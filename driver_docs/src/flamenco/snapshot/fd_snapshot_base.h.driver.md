# Purpose
This C header file defines constants, structures, and function prototypes related to managing snapshot metadata in a system, likely for a database or a similar application. It includes alignment constants for memory management (`FD_SNAPSHOT_CREATE_ALIGN` and `FD_SNAPSHOT_ACC_ALIGN`) and defines types of snapshots (`FD_SNAPSHOT_TYPE_UNSPECIFIED`, `FD_SNAPSHOT_TYPE_FULL`, `FD_SNAPSHOT_TYPE_INCREMENTAL`) and snapshot sources (`FD_SNAPSHOT_SRC_FILE`, `FD_SNAPSHOT_SRC_HTTP`). The `fd_snapshot_name` structure is used to encapsulate metadata about a snapshot, including its type, slot information, and file extension. The file also declares function prototypes for creating and validating snapshot names from strings or buffers, which suggests that these operations are essential for the system's snapshot management functionality.

### fd\_snapshot\_name\_from\_buf
- **Type**: `function pointer`
- **Description**: The `fd_snapshot_name_from_buf` is a function that takes a pointer to an `fd_snapshot_name_t` structure, a constant character pointer `str`, and an unsigned long `str_len`. It is designed to populate the `fd_snapshot_name_t` structure based on the data provided in the buffer `str` with a specified length `str_len`. This function is part of the snapshot handling utilities in the Flamenco snapshot module.
- **Use**: This function is used to initialize or populate an `fd_snapshot_name_t` structure from a buffer containing snapshot name data.


# Data Structures

---
### fd\_snapshot\_name
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `type`: An integer representing the type of snapshot, such as full or incremental.
    - `slot`: An unsigned long integer representing the slot number associated with the snapshot.
    - `incremental_slot`: An unsigned long integer representing the incremental slot number for incremental snapshots.
    - `fhash`: A hash value of type fd_hash_t associated with the snapshot.
    - `file_ext`: A character array of length 16 representing the file extension of the snapshot.
- **Description**: The `fd_snapshot_name` structure is used to represent metadata about a snapshot in the system, including its type, associated slot numbers, a hash for identification, and a file extension. This structure is crucial for managing and identifying different snapshots, whether they are full or incremental, and is used in various functions to create and validate snapshot names from strings or buffers.

### fd\_snapshot\_name\_t
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `type`: An integer representing the type of snapshot.
    - `slot`: An unsigned long representing the slot number associated with the snapshot.
    - `incremental_slot`: An unsigned long representing the incremental slot number for incremental snapshots.
    - `fhash`: A hash value of type fd_hash_t associated with the snapshot.
    - `file_ext`: A character array of size 16 representing the file extension of the snapshot.
- **Description**: The `fd_snapshot_name_t` structure is used to represent a snapshot in the system, containing information about the snapshot type, slot numbers, a hash, and a file extension. It is designed to handle both full and incremental snapshots, with fields to store relevant metadata such as the type of snapshot, the slot and incremental slot numbers, a hash for identification, and a file extension for file handling purposes.


# Function Declarations (Public API)

---
### fd\_snapshot\_name\_from\_buf<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_snapshot_name_from_buf}} -->
Converts a buffer to a snapshot name structure.
- **Description**: This function initializes a `fd_snapshot_name_t` structure using a string buffer. It is useful when you have a string buffer that represents a snapshot name and you want to convert it into a structured format. The function ensures that the string is null-terminated and does not exceed a predefined buffer size. It should be called when you need to parse a snapshot name from a buffer with a known length. The function expects the buffer to be a valid string representation and handles truncation if the buffer length exceeds the maximum allowed size.
- **Inputs**:
    - `id`: A pointer to an `fd_snapshot_name_t` structure where the parsed snapshot name will be stored. Must not be null. The caller retains ownership.
    - `str`: A pointer to a character array containing the string buffer to be converted. Must not be null. The buffer should represent a valid snapshot name.
    - `str_len`: The length of the string buffer. If it exceeds the maximum buffer size, the string will be truncated to fit.
- **Output**: Returns a pointer to the initialized `fd_snapshot_name_t` structure provided by the caller.
- **See also**: [`fd_snapshot_name_from_buf`](fd_snapshot_base.c.driver.md#fd_snapshot_name_from_buf)  (Implementation)


---
### fd\_snapshot\_name\_slot\_validate<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_snapshot_name_slot_validate}} -->
Validates the slot of an incremental snapshot against a base slot.
- **Description**: Use this function to ensure that an incremental snapshot's slot matches a specified base slot. This is particularly useful when verifying the consistency of snapshot data. The function should be called when you have an incremental snapshot and need to confirm its alignment with a full snapshot. If the snapshot type is not incremental, the function will always succeed. If the snapshot type is incremental and the slots do not match, a warning is logged, and the function returns an error code.
- **Inputs**:
    - `id`: A pointer to an fd_snapshot_name_t structure representing the snapshot to validate. The structure must be properly initialized and must not be null. The function checks the type and slot fields of this structure.
    - `base_slot`: An unsigned long representing the expected base slot number. This is the slot number that the incremental snapshot's slot is expected to match.
- **Output**: Returns 0 if the validation is successful or if the snapshot type is not incremental. Returns -1 if the snapshot type is incremental and the slots do not match.
- **See also**: [`fd_snapshot_name_slot_validate`](fd_snapshot_base.c.driver.md#fd_snapshot_name_slot_validate)  (Implementation)
