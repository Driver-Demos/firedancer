# Purpose
This C source code file is a simple test program designed to verify the functionality of an HTTP snapshot retrieval mechanism. It includes the "fd_snapshot_http.h" header, which likely defines the structures and functions used for handling HTTP requests related to snapshots. The [`main`](#main) function initializes the environment with `fd_boot`, sets up an HTTP snapshot request using `fd_snapshot_http_new`, and performs a test to ensure the HTTP request buffer contains the expected GET request for a file named "snapshot.tar.bz2". The program uses `FD_TEST` macros to assert the correctness of the HTTP request construction and the proper deletion of the HTTP snapshot object. Finally, it concludes by calling `fd_halt` to clean up before exiting.

### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function initializes the program, creates an HTTP snapshot request, verifies its correctness, and then cleans up before exiting.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The count of command-line arguments passed to the program.
    - `argv`: An array of strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Call `fd_boot` to initialize the program with command-line arguments.
    - Declare and initialize a `fd_snapshot_name_t` structure named `name`.
    - Declare a `fd_snapshot_http_t` array `_http` and create a pointer `http` using [`fd_snapshot_http_new`](fd_snapshot_http.c.driver.md#fd_snapshot_http_new) to initialize an HTTP snapshot request with specified parameters.
    - Use `FD_TEST` to verify that the `http` pointer is not null, indicating successful creation of the HTTP request.
    - Use `FD_TEST` and `memcmp` to verify that the HTTP request buffer contains the expected HTTP GET request string.
    - Use `FD_TEST` to verify that [`fd_snapshot_http_delete`](fd_snapshot_http.c.driver.md#fd_snapshot_http_delete) correctly deletes the HTTP snapshot and returns the original `_http` pointer.
    - Call `fd_halt` to perform any necessary cleanup before exiting the program.
    - Return 0 to indicate successful execution.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer value of 0, indicating successful execution of the program.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`fd_snapshot_http_new`](fd_snapshot_http.c.driver.md#fd_snapshot_http_new)
    - [`fd_snapshot_http_delete`](fd_snapshot_http.c.driver.md#fd_snapshot_http_delete)
