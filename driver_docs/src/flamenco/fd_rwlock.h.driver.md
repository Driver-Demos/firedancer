# Purpose
This C header file defines a simple read-write spin lock mechanism, which is a synchronization primitive used to manage access to a shared resource in concurrent programming. The `fd_rwlock` structure uses a 16-bit unsigned short to represent the lock state, where the value indicates whether the lock is free, held by readers, or write-locked. The file provides inline functions for acquiring and releasing both read and write locks ([`fd_rwlock_read`](#fd_rwlock_read), [`fd_rwlock_unread`](#fd_rwlock_unread), [`fd_rwlock_write`](#fd_rwlock_write), and [`fd_rwlock_unwrite`](#fd_rwlock_unwrite)), utilizing atomic operations and spin-waiting to ensure thread safety when `FD_HAS_THREADS` is defined. This implementation is designed to be efficient in environments with or without threading support, using compiler memory fences to ensure proper memory ordering.

# Data Structures

---
### fd\_rwlock
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `value`: A ushort representing the lock state, where 0 is unlocked, 1 to 0xFFFE indicates the number of readers holding the lock, and 0xFFFF indicates a write lock.
- **Description**: The `fd_rwlock` structure is a simple read-write spin lock implemented using a single `ushort` value to manage lock states. It allows multiple readers to hold the lock simultaneously, indicated by values from 1 to 0xFFFE, while a write lock is represented by the value 0xFFFF. The lock is unlocked when the value is 0. This structure is designed to be used in environments with or without threading support, utilizing atomic operations and spin-waiting for thread safety when necessary.


---
### fd\_rwlock\_t
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `value`: A ushort representing the lock state, where 0 is unlocked, 1 to 0xFFFE indicates the number of readers, and 0xFFFF indicates a write lock.
- **Description**: The `fd_rwlock_t` is a simple read-write spin lock structure that uses a single `ushort` value to manage lock states. It allows multiple readers or a single writer to hold the lock at any given time. The lock is implemented with atomic operations to ensure thread safety in concurrent environments, and it provides functions to acquire and release read and write locks.


# Functions

---
### fd\_rwlock\_write<!-- {{#callable:fd_rwlock_write}} -->
The `fd_rwlock_write` function attempts to acquire a write lock on a read-write spin lock by setting its value to 0xFFFF, indicating it is write-locked.
- **Inputs**:
    - `lock`: A pointer to an `fd_rwlock_t` structure representing the read-write lock to be write-locked.
- **Control Flow**:
    - If threading is enabled (`FD_HAS_THREADS` is true), enter an infinite loop to attempt acquiring the write lock.
    - Within the loop, read the current value of the lock.
    - Check if the lock is currently unlocked (value is 0).
    - If unlocked, attempt to atomically set the lock's value to 0xFFFF using `FD_ATOMIC_CAS`.
    - If the atomic compare-and-swap is successful, exit the function, indicating the lock is acquired.
    - If the lock is not acquired, call `FD_SPIN_PAUSE()` to yield the processor and retry.
    - If threading is not enabled, directly set the lock's value to 0xFFFF, indicating it is write-locked.
    - Ensure memory ordering by calling `FD_COMPILER_MFENCE()` after setting the lock.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it either successfully acquires the write lock or continues attempting until it does.


---
### fd\_rwlock\_unwrite<!-- {{#callable:fd_rwlock_unwrite}} -->
The `fd_rwlock_unwrite` function releases a write lock on a read-write lock by setting its value to 0.
- **Inputs**:
    - `lock`: A pointer to an `fd_rwlock_t` structure representing the read-write lock to be released from a write lock.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function begins by executing a memory fence operation using `FD_COMPILER_MFENCE()` to ensure memory operations are completed in order.
    - The lock's `value` is set to 0, indicating that the lock is now unlocked.
- **Output**: The function does not return any value; it modifies the state of the lock in place.


---
### fd\_rwlock\_read<!-- {{#callable:fd_rwlock_read}} -->
The `fd_rwlock_read` function acquires a read lock on a read-write spin lock, allowing multiple readers but blocking writers.
- **Inputs**:
    - `lock`: A pointer to an `fd_rwlock_t` structure representing the read-write lock to be acquired for reading.
- **Control Flow**:
    - If threading is enabled (`FD_HAS_THREADS` is true), enter an infinite loop to attempt acquiring the read lock.
    - Retrieve the current value of the lock's `value` field.
    - Check if the lock is not write-locked and can accommodate another reader (`value < 0xFFFE`).
    - If the lock can accommodate another reader, attempt to atomically increment the `value` field using `FD_ATOMIC_CAS`.
    - If the atomic increment is successful, exit the function, indicating the read lock has been acquired.
    - If the atomic increment fails, pause briefly (`FD_SPIN_PAUSE`) and retry.
    - If threading is not enabled, simply increment the `value` field to acquire the read lock.
    - Ensure memory ordering by calling `FD_COMPILER_MFENCE` after acquiring the lock.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it modifies the state of the lock to indicate a read lock has been acquired.


---
### fd\_rwlock\_unread<!-- {{#callable:fd_rwlock_unread}} -->
The `fd_rwlock_unread` function decrements the reader count of a read-write lock, effectively releasing a read lock.
- **Inputs**:
    - `lock`: A pointer to an `fd_rwlock_t` structure representing the read-write lock to be decremented.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function begins by executing a memory fence operation using `FD_COMPILER_MFENCE()` to ensure memory ordering constraints are respected.
    - If threading is enabled (`FD_HAS_THREADS` is true), the function atomically decrements the `value` field of the `lock` structure using `FD_ATOMIC_FETCH_AND_SUB`.
    - If threading is not enabled, the function simply decrements the `value` field of the `lock` structure directly.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it modifies the `lock` structure in place to reflect the release of a read lock.
