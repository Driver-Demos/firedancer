## Files
- **[fd_dn_expand.c](resolv/fd_dn_expand.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_dn_expand.c` file contains a function that expands a domain name from a compressed format to a full string representation, handling potential reference loops and ensuring the output fits within a specified space.
- **[fd_dns_parse.c](resolv/fd_dns_parse.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_dns_parse.c` file contains a function that parses DNS response messages and processes them using a callback function.
- **[fd_getaddrinfo.c](resolv/fd_getaddrinfo.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_getaddrinfo.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase implements a function to resolve hostnames to addresses, similar to `getaddrinfo`, and provides error string conversion for address resolution errors.
- **[fd_io_readline.c](resolv/fd_io_readline.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_io_readline.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase provides functions for reading lines and characters from a buffered input stream, handling errors and buffer management.
- **[fd_io_readline.h](resolv/fd_io_readline.h.driver.md)**: The `fd_io_readline.h` file provides helper functions for buffered line reading, including `fd_io_fgets` and `fd_io_fgetc`, in the `firedancer` codebase.
- **[fd_lookup.h](resolv/fd_lookup.h.driver.md)**: The `fd_lookup.h` file in the `firedancer` codebase defines structures and functions for DNS resolution and address lookup, including handling of resolver configurations and DNS packet parsing.
- **[fd_lookup_ipliteral.c](resolv/fd_lookup_ipliteral.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_lookup_ipliteral.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase implements a function to resolve IP literals into address structures, supporting both IPv4 and IPv6 formats.
- **[fd_lookup_name.c](resolv/fd_lookup_name.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_lookup_name.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase implements a function for resolving hostnames to network addresses using various methods, including checking null names, numeric addresses, local hosts file, and DNS, while also handling IPv4 and IPv6 address selection and sorting based on RFC 3484/6724 rules.
- **[fd_netdb.h](resolv/fd_netdb.h.driver.md)**: The `fd_netdb.h` file in the `firedancer` codebase defines structures and functions for network database operations, including opening file descriptors for `/etc/hosts` and `/etc/resolv.conf`, and a custom implementation of `getaddrinfo`.
- **[fd_netdb_open_fds.c](resolv/fd_netdb_open_fds.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_netdb_open_fds.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase provides a function to open file descriptors for `/etc/resolv.conf` and `/etc/hosts`, storing them in a `fd_netdb_fds_t` structure.
- **[fd_res_mkquery.c](resolv/fd_res_mkquery.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_res_mkquery.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase implements a function to construct a DNS query with specified operation, domain name, class, and type, while ensuring constraints on input parameters and generating a unique query ID.
- **[fd_res_msend.c](resolv/fd_res_msend.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_res_msend.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase implements a function for sending multiple DNS queries over UDP and TCP, handling retries and fallbacks in case of server failures or truncated responses.
- **[fd_resolv.h](resolv/fd_resolv.h.driver.md)**: The `fd_resolv.h` file in the `firedancer` codebase declares functions for DNS name expansion and query creation with hidden visibility attributes.
- **[fd_resolvconf.c](resolv/fd_resolvconf.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_resolvconf.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase implements a function to parse and extract DNS configuration settings from the `/etc/resolv.conf` file, including options like `ndots`, `attempts`, `timeout`, and `nameserver` addresses.
- **[Local.mk](resolv/Local.mk.driver.md)**: The `Local.mk` file in the `firedancer` codebase specifies the inclusion of headers and object files for high-level API, configuration, and low-level DNS functionalities, as well as a unit test for `test_getaddrinfo`, conditional on `FD_HAS_HOSTED`.
- **[README.md](resolv/README.md.driver.md)**: The `README.md` file in the `firedancer/src/waltz/resolv` directory describes the `fd_resolv` module, a Linux userland DNS resolver for WAN servers, detailing its modifications from the musl libc's `getaddrinfo` implementation and its alignment with Firedancer's code style.
- **[test_getaddrinfo.c](resolv/test_getaddrinfo.c.driver.md)**: The `test_getaddrinfo.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase tests the functionality of resolving hostnames to IP addresses using the `fd_getaddrinfo` function and prints the results for both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
