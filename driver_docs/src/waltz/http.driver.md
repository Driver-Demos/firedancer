## Files
- **[.gitignore](http/.gitignore.driver.md)**: The `.gitignore` file in the `firedancer/src/waltz/http/` directory specifies that the files `picohttpparsertemp.c` and `fd_picohttpparser.c` should be ignored by Git.
- **[fd_http_server.c](http/fd_http_server.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_http_server.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase implements an HTTP server with WebSocket support, handling connections, requests, and responses, including error handling and connection management.
- **[fd_http_server.h](http/fd_http_server.h.driver.md)**: The `fd_http_server.h` file in the `firedancer` codebase defines the interface for a WebSocket-capable HTTP server designed to efficiently stream messages to multiple clients, with features for handling HTTP requests, WebSocket connections, and managing client connections using a ring buffer for outgoing messages.
- **[fd_http_server_private.h](http/fd_http_server_private.h.driver.md)**: The `fd_http_server_private.h` file defines internal structures and constants for managing HTTP and WebSocket server connections in the Firedancer codebase.
- **[fd_picohttpparser.patch](http/fd_picohttpparser.patch.driver.md)**: The `fd_picohttpparser.patch` file in the `firedancer` codebase contains modifications to the `picohttpparser` code, primarily adding explicit type casting and fallthrough attributes to improve type safety and control flow.
- **[fd_url.c](http/fd_url.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_url.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase provides a function to parse a URL string into its components, such as scheme, host, and port, while handling errors related to unsupported schemes and userinfo.
- **[fd_url.h](http/fd_url.h.driver.md)**: The `fd_url.h` file provides a basic, non-RFC compliant API for parsing and handling URLs, specifically supporting only HTTP and HTTPS schemes without userinfo, in the `firedancer` codebase.
- **[fuzz_httpserver.c](http/fuzz_httpserver.c.driver.md)**: The `fuzz_httpserver.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase implements a fuzz testing framework for an HTTP server, simulating various HTTP and WebSocket interactions to test the server's robustness and error handling.
- **[fuzz_picohttpparser.c](http/fuzz_picohttpparser.c.driver.md)**: The `fuzz_picohttpparser.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase implements fuzz testing for the picohttpparser library, focusing on parsing HTTP requests, responses, headers, and chunked data.
- **[fuzz_url_parse.c](http/fuzz_url_parse.c.driver.md)**: The `fuzz_url_parse.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase implements a fuzzing test for URL parsing, ensuring that parsed components are within the bounds of the input data.
- **[Local.mk](http/Local.mk.driver.md)**: The `Local.mk` file in the `firedancer` codebase specifies the build instructions for the HTTP components, including applying patches, compiling objects, and setting up unit and fuzz tests for the `fd_http_server`, `picohttpparser`, and `fd_url`.
- **[picohttpparser.c](http/picohttpparser.c.driver.md)**: The `picohttpparser.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase provides an implementation for parsing HTTP requests and responses, including functions for handling headers and chunked transfer encoding.
- **[picohttpparser.h](http/picohttpparser.h.driver.md)**: The `picohttpparser.h` file in the `firedancer` codebase provides function declarations and structures for parsing HTTP requests, responses, and headers, as well as decoding chunked transfer encoding.
- **[README.txt](http/README.txt.driver.md)**: The `README.txt` file in the `firedancer` codebase explains that the directory contains a patched version of the picohttpparser library, originally from commit `66534e6`, and provides instructions for updating the patch.
- **[test_http_server.c](http/test_http_server.c.driver.md)**: The `test_http_server.c` file contains a test suite for the HTTP server implementation in the Firedancer project, focusing on testing the server's handling of staged data and response body management.
- **[test_http_server.py](http/test_http_server.py.driver.md)**: The `test_http_server.py` file in the `firedancer` codebase tests an HTTP server by making multiple GET and POST requests and establishes a WebSocket connection to subscribe to slot updates.
- **[test_live_http_server.c](http/test_live_http_server.c.driver.md)**: The `test_live_http_server.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase implements a test HTTP server with WebSocket support, handling HTTP requests and WebSocket messages, and includes signal handling for graceful shutdown.
- **[test_live_http_server.py](http/test_live_http_server.py.driver.md)**: The `test_live_http_server.py` file tests the functionality of an HTTP server by making multiple GET and POST requests and establishing a WebSocket connection to verify responses.
