## Files
- **[fd_neigh4_map.c](neigh/fd_neigh4_map.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_neigh4_map.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase implements functions for handling IPv4 neighbor mappings, including printing the mappings to a file.
- **[fd_neigh4_map.h](neigh/fd_neigh4_map.h.driver.md)**: The `fd_neigh4_map.h` file defines structures and functions for managing IPv4 neighbor discovery using ARP, including printing the routing table, within the Firedancer codebase.
- **[fd_neigh4_map_defines.h](neigh/fd_neigh4_map_defines.h.driver.md)**: The `fd_neigh4_map_defines.h` file defines macros for a hash map implementation, specifying the map name, element type, key type, key, and key hash function.
- **[fd_neigh4_netlink.c](neigh/fd_neigh4_netlink.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_neigh4_netlink.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase handles the sending and processing of netlink messages related to IPv4 neighbor table updates, including adding, updating, or removing entries based on the received netlink messages.
- **[fd_neigh4_netlink.h](neigh/fd_neigh4_netlink.h.driver.md)**: The `fd_neigh4_netlink.h` file provides APIs for importing IPv4 neighbors from Linux netlink, including functions to request a dump of the IPv4 neighbor table and to ingest netlink messages for updating the neighbor table.
- **[fd_neigh4_probe.c](neigh/fd_neigh4_probe.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_neigh4_probe.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase implements functions for initializing, finalizing, and executing IPv4 neighbor probing using UDP sockets with rate limiting and delay management.
- **[fd_neigh4_probe.h](neigh/fd_neigh4_probe.h.driver.md)**: The `fd_neigh4_probe.h` file in the `firedancer` codebase implements a mechanism for triggering ARP requests in Linux using empty UDP packets to facilitate neighbor discovery with minimal privileges.
- **[Local.mk](neigh/Local.mk.driver.md)**: The `Local.mk` file in the `firedancer` codebase specifies the headers and object files for the `fd_neigh4_map` and conditionally for `fd_neigh4_netlink` and `fd_neigh4_probe` if `FD_HAS_LINUX` is defined, as well as a unit test for `test_neigh4_netlink`.
- **[test_neigh4_netlink.c](neigh/test_neigh4_netlink.c.driver.md)**: The `test_neigh4_netlink.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase tests the functionality of dumping and managing neighbor tables for network interfaces using netlink in a Linux environment.
