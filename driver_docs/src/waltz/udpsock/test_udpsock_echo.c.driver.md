# Purpose
This C source code file implements a simple UDP echo server. The primary functionality of the code is to receive UDP packets, swap the source and destination IP addresses and ports, and then send the modified packets back to the sender. The code achieves this by setting up a UDP socket to listen on a specified port (defaulting to 8080 if not provided via command line arguments) and using asynchronous I/O operations to handle incoming packets. The [`echo_aio_recv`](#echo_aio_recv) function is responsible for processing each packet by swapping the source and destination fields in the Ethernet, IP, and UDP headers before sending them back using the `fd_aio_send` function.

The code is structured around the use of several utility functions and data structures, such as `fd_udpsock_t` for managing the UDP socket and `fd_aio_t` for asynchronous I/O operations. It includes initialization and cleanup routines to manage resources like sockets and memory allocations. The main function orchestrates the setup of the UDP socket, the allocation of necessary resources, and the continuous servicing of incoming packets in an infinite loop. This file is designed to be compiled into an executable that runs the echo server, and it does not define any public APIs or external interfaces for use by other programs.

# Functions

---
### echo\_aio\_recv<!-- {{#callable:echo_aio_recv}} -->
The `echo_aio_recv` function swaps the source and destination addresses of UDP/IP packets in a batch and sends them out using an asynchronous I/O context.
- **Inputs**:
    - `ctx`: A pointer to the asynchronous I/O context used for sending the modified packets.
    - `batch`: A constant pointer to an array of packet information structures, each containing a buffer with a packet to be processed.
    - `batch_cnt`: The number of packets in the batch to be processed.
    - `opt_batch_idx`: An optional pointer to a variable that can store the index of the batch being processed.
    - `flush`: An integer flag indicating whether to flush the send operation.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Iterate over each packet in the batch using a for loop.
    - For each packet, extract the Ethernet, IP, and UDP headers from the packet buffer.
    - Copy the source and destination IP addresses and UDP ports from the headers.
    - Swap the source and destination IP addresses and UDP ports in the headers.
    - Decrement the IP header's TTL (Time To Live) field by one.
    - Send the modified batch of packets using the provided asynchronous I/O context.
- **Output**: The function returns `FD_AIO_SUCCESS` to indicate successful processing and sending of the packets.


---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function initializes a UDP socket server that listens on a specified port and echoes received packets back to the sender.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments passed to the program.
    - `argv`: An array of strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize the environment using `fd_boot` with command-line arguments.
    - Extract the port number from the command-line arguments, defaulting to 8080 if not specified.
    - Create a UDP socket using `socket` with `AF_INET`, `SOCK_DGRAM`, and `IPPROTO_UDP`.
    - Check if the socket creation was successful; log an error and exit if not.
    - Set up a `sockaddr_in` structure for listening on all interfaces at the specified port.
    - Bind the socket to the address; log an error and exit if binding fails.
    - Allocate and initialize a `fd_udpsock_t` structure for managing UDP socket operations.
    - Join the UDP socket to the `fd_udpsock` structure and verify success.
    - Create and join an asynchronous I/O (AIO) structure for handling received packets with `echo_aio_recv`.
    - Set the AIO structure to handle incoming packets on the UDP socket.
    - Enter an infinite loop to continuously service the UDP socket using [`fd_udpsock_service`](fd_udpsock.c.driver.md#fd_udpsock_service).
    - Upon termination (though not reachable in this code), clean up resources by deleting AIO and UDP socket structures and closing the socket.
    - Log a notice of successful cleanup and call `fd_halt` before returning 0.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer status code, 0, indicating successful execution, although it is designed to run indefinitely.
