# Purpose
This is a Makefile snippet used for conditional compilation. It adds the header file `fd_openssl.h` and, if the `FD_HAS_OPENSSL` flag is defined, it includes the object files `fd_openssl` and `fd_waltz` in the build process. This setup is typically used to manage dependencies and compile options based on the presence of OpenSSL support.
