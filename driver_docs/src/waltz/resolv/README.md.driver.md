# Purpose
The provided content is a documentation excerpt for a module named `fd_resolv`, which serves as a DNS resolver for Linux userland, specifically designed for servers on a Wide Area Network (WAN). The module is a modified version of the `getaddrinfo` implementation from musl libc, adapted to align with Firedancer's coding standards and rewritten in C17 style. Key modifications include the removal of pthread cancellation and cleanup API support, the replacement of internal musl API usages with public libc variants, and the elimination of `malloc` calls to enhance security and compatibility with sandboxing techniques like seccomp and landlock. Additionally, the module optimizes sandboxing by reusing file descriptors for `/etc/hosts` and `/etc/resolv.conf`, and it is not optimized for performance. The copyright information is referenced in a separate file, `/NOTICE`.
