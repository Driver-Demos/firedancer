# Purpose
The provided content is a segment from a Makefile, which is used to automate the build process of a software project. This particular section is conditional, executed only if the `FD_HAS_HOSTED` variable is defined, indicating that the build is for a hosted environment. The file organizes the inclusion of headers and object files into different categories: high-level API, configuration, and low-level DNS operations. It uses custom macros like `add-hdrs` and `add-objs` to add header files and object files, respectively, to the build process. Additionally, it specifies a unit test, `test_getaddrinfo`, to be compiled and linked with the `fd_waltz` and `fd_util` libraries, ensuring that the functionality related to address information retrieval is tested.
