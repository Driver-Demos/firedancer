# Purpose
The provided C code defines a function [`fd_lookup_ipliteral`](#fd_lookup_ipliteral), which is designed to resolve IP address literals into a structured address format. This function is part of a broader networking utility, as indicated by its inclusion of various networking headers such as `<sys/socket.h>`, `<netinet/in.h>`, and `<arpa/inet.h>`. The function takes a buffer to store the resolved address, a string representing the IP address, and the address family (IPv4 or IPv6) as parameters. It first attempts to interpret the input string as an IPv4 address using `inet_aton`. If successful and the family matches, it stores the address in the buffer. If the input is not an IPv4 address, it checks for an IPv6 address using `inet_pton`, handling potential scope identifiers for link-local addresses.

This code provides a narrow functionality focused on IP address resolution, specifically handling both IPv4 and IPv6 literals. It is likely part of a larger library or application dealing with network communications, as suggested by the inclusion of a custom header `"fd_lookup.h"` and a utility header `"../../util/cstr/fd_cstr.h"`. The function does not define a public API or external interface but rather serves as an internal utility to facilitate address resolution within the application. The use of specific error codes like `FD_EAI_NODATA` and `FD_EAI_NONAME` suggests a structured approach to error handling, likely defined elsewhere in the application.

# Functions

---
### fd\_lookup\_ipliteral<!-- {{#callable:fd_lookup_ipliteral}} -->
The `fd_lookup_ipliteral` function attempts to convert a string representation of an IP address into a binary format and store it in a provided buffer, handling both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
- **Inputs**:
    - `buf`: A buffer of type `struct address` where the converted IP address will be stored.
    - `name`: A string representing the IP address to be converted.
    - `family`: An integer specifying the address family (AF_INET for IPv4 or AF_INET6 for IPv6) expected for the conversion.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Declare variables for IPv4 and IPv6 address structures.
    - Use `inet_aton` to attempt conversion of `name` to an IPv4 address; if successful, check if the family is AF_INET6 and return FD_EAI_NODATA if it is, otherwise store the address in `buf` and return 1.
    - If `inet_aton` fails, check for a '%' character in `name` to handle potential scope IDs for IPv6 addresses.
    - Use `inet_pton` to attempt conversion of `name` to an IPv6 address; if unsuccessful, return 0.
    - If the family is AF_INET, return FD_EAI_NODATA as the wrong family is specified.
    - Store the IPv6 address in `buf` and handle scope ID if present, checking for link-local addresses and converting interface names to indices.
    - Return FD_EAI_NONAME if scope ID conversion fails or is invalid, otherwise store the scope ID in `buf` and return 1.
- **Output**: Returns 1 on successful conversion and storage of the IP address, 0 if the conversion fails, or an error code (FD_EAI_NODATA or FD_EAI_NONAME) if there is a family mismatch or scope ID issue.
