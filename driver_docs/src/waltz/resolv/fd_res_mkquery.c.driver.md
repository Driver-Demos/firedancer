# Purpose
The provided C code defines a function [`fd_res_mkquery`](#fd_res_mkquery), which is part of a DNS resolution library, as indicated by the inclusion of the header file "fd_resolv.h". This function constructs a DNS query message based on the provided parameters: operation code (`op`), domain name (`dname`), class, type, and a buffer (`buf`) with its length (`buflen`). The function ensures that the domain name is properly formatted and that the buffer is large enough to hold the query. It also generates a unique identifier for the query using a hash of the current tick count, which is obtained from the `fd_tickcount()` function, likely defined in the included logging utility "fd_log.h".

The function is designed to be robust, with checks to prevent buffer overflows and invalid input values. It constructs the DNS query by setting specific fields in a template, such as the operation code and class/type of the query, and then copies the constructed query into the provided buffer. The function returns the length of the constructed query or -1 if an error occurs. This code is intended to be part of a larger DNS resolution system, providing a specific utility function for creating DNS queries, and is not a standalone executable. It does not define public APIs or external interfaces directly but rather contributes to the internal workings of a DNS resolution library.

### fd\_res\_mkquery<!-- {{#callable:fd_res_mkquery}} -->
The `fd_res_mkquery` function constructs a DNS query message based on the provided parameters and stores it in a buffer.
- **Inputs**:
    - `op`: An integer representing the operation code for the DNS query, which should be between 0 and 15.
    - `dname`: A constant character pointer to the domain name for which the DNS query is being made.
    - `class`: An integer representing the class of the DNS query, typically 1 for Internet (IN).
    - `type`: An integer representing the type of the DNS query, such as A, AAAA, MX, etc.
    - `buf`: A pointer to an unsigned character array where the constructed DNS query will be stored.
    - `buflen`: An integer representing the length of the buffer `buf`.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Calculate the length of the domain name `dname` up to 255 characters.
    - If the domain name ends with a '.', decrement the length by one; if it still ends with a '.', return -1 indicating an error.
    - Calculate the required length `n` for the query message and check if it exceeds constraints; if so, return -1.
    - Initialize a query template `q` with zeroes and set specific fields for operation, flags, and question count.
    - Copy the domain name into the query template and encode each label's length; if any label exceeds 62 characters, return -1.
    - Set the type and class fields in the query template.
    - Generate a pseudo-random ID using a hash of the current tick count and store it in the query template.
    - Copy the constructed query from `q` to the provided buffer `buf`.
    - Return the length `n` of the constructed query.
- **Output**: The function returns the length of the constructed DNS query message on success, or -1 if an error occurs during construction.
