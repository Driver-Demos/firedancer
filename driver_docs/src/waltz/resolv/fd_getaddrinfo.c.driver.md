# Purpose
This C source code file provides functionality for network address resolution, specifically implementing a custom version of the `getaddrinfo` function, named [`fd_getaddrinfo`](#fd_getaddrinfo). The primary purpose of this function is to translate a host name into a set of socket addresses, which can be used for network communication. The function takes a host name, optional hints for address family and flags, and outputs a linked list of address information structures. It handles both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses and includes error handling for various conditions such as invalid flags, unsupported address families, and memory allocation issues. The code also includes a helper function, [`fd_gai_strerror`](#fd_gai_strerror), which translates error codes into human-readable error messages, enhancing the usability of the address resolution process.

The file includes several headers, indicating dependencies on system-level networking libraries and custom utility functions, such as `fd_lookup_name` for name resolution and `fd_io_strerror` for error string conversion. The code is structured to be part of a larger library or application, as it relies on external definitions and utility functions. It does not define a public API or external interface directly but provides essential network-related functionality that can be integrated into broader network communication modules. The use of custom error codes and structures suggests that this code is part of a specialized networking library, possibly designed for environments where standard library functions are insufficient or need to be extended.

# Functions

---
### fd\_getaddrinfo<!-- {{#callable:fd_getaddrinfo}} -->
The `fd_getaddrinfo` function resolves a hostname into a list of address structures, considering optional hints and memory constraints.
- **Inputs**:
    - `host`: A constant character pointer to the hostname to be resolved.
    - `hint`: A constant pointer to a `fd_addrinfo_t` structure providing hints about the type of socket the caller supports.
    - `res`: A pointer to a pointer to `fd_addrinfo_t` where the result will be stored.
    - `pout`: A pointer to a void pointer for memory allocation purposes.
    - `out_max`: An unsigned long indicating the maximum size of the output buffer.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize `family` to `AF_UNSPEC` and `flags` to 0.
    - Check if `host` is NULL and return `FD_EAI_NONAME` if true.
    - If `hint` is provided, set `family` and `flags` from `hint` and validate `flags` against a mask; return `FD_EAI_BADFLAGS` if invalid.
    - Validate `family` against supported address families; return `FD_EAI_FAMILY` if unsupported.
    - Call [`fd_lookup_name`](fd_lookup_name.c.driver.md#fd_lookup_name) to resolve the hostname into addresses and canonical name; return error if resolution fails.
    - Calculate the required allocation size and check if `pout` is NULL or `out_max` is insufficient; return `FD_EAI_MEMORY` if true.
    - Allocate memory for the canonical name if it exists and copy it to the output buffer.
    - Iterate over resolved addresses, populate `aibuf` structures, and link them in a list.
    - Set the reference count in the first `aibuf` and assign the result to `res`.
- **Output**: Returns 0 on success, or an error code indicating the type of failure.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`fd_lookup_name`](fd_lookup_name.c.driver.md#fd_lookup_name)


---
### fd\_gai\_strerror<!-- {{#callable:fd_gai_strerror}} -->
The `fd_gai_strerror` function returns a human-readable string describing the error code provided by the `gai` parameter.
- **Inputs**:
    - `gai`: An integer representing the error code for which a descriptive string is needed.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if `gai` is less than or equal to `FD_EAI_SYSTEM`; if true, calculate `err` as `gai - FD_EAI_SYSTEM` and return the result of `fd_io_strerror(err)`.
    - Use a switch statement to match `gai` against predefined error codes such as `FD_EAI_BADFLAGS`, `FD_EAI_NONAME`, etc., and return the corresponding error message string.
    - If `gai` does not match any predefined error codes, return the string "unknown error".
- **Output**: A constant character pointer to a string that describes the error associated with the given `gai` code.
