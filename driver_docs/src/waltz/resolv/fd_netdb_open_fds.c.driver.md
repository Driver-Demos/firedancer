# Purpose
This C source code file is designed to manage file descriptors for network database files, specifically `/etc/resolv.conf` and `/etc/hosts`. It provides a function, [`fd_netdb_open_fds`](#fd_netdb_open_fds), which opens these files in read-only mode and assigns their file descriptors to global thread-local variables `fd_etc_hosts_fd` and `fd_etc_resolv_conf_fd`. The function checks if these file descriptors are already open, returning `NULL` if they are, to prevent reopening. If the files are successfully opened, their descriptors are stored in a structure `fd_netdb_fds_t`, which is returned to the caller. This structure allows other parts of the program to access the file descriptors for these critical network configuration files.

The code includes error handling and logging mechanisms to report issues when opening the files, utilizing the `fd_log` and `fd_io` utilities for logging and error string conversion, respectively. The inclusion of headers like `fd_netdb.h` and `fd_lookup.h` suggests that this file is part of a larger library or application dealing with network database operations. The use of thread-local storage for the file descriptors indicates that the code is designed to be thread-safe, allowing multiple threads to manage their own instances of these file descriptors without interference. This file is likely a component of a broader system that requires access to network configuration data, providing a focused utility for managing access to these specific files.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `fd_netdb.h`
- `fd_lookup.h`
- `errno.h`
- `fcntl.h`
- `../../util/log/fd_log.h`
- `../../util/io/fd_io.h`


# Global Variables

---
### fd\_etc\_hosts\_fd
- **Type**: `int`
- **Description**: The `fd_etc_hosts_fd` is a global integer variable initialized to -1, which is used to store the file descriptor for the '/etc/hosts' file. It is part of the file descriptor management for network database operations.
- **Use**: This variable is used to hold the file descriptor for the '/etc/hosts' file, allowing the program to read from this file when necessary.


---
### fd\_etc\_resolv\_conf\_fd
- **Type**: `int`
- **Description**: The variable `fd_etc_resolv_conf_fd` is a global integer variable initialized to -1, which is used to store the file descriptor for the '/etc/resolv.conf' file. This file typically contains DNS resolver configurations on Unix-like systems.
- **Use**: This variable is used to hold the file descriptor after successfully opening the '/etc/resolv.conf' file in read-only mode.


# Functions

---
### fd\_netdb\_open\_fds<!-- {{#callable:fd_netdb_open_fds}} -->
The `fd_netdb_open_fds` function opens file descriptors for `/etc/resolv.conf` and `/etc/hosts`, storing them in a provided structure if successful.
- **Inputs**:
    - `fds`: A pointer to an `fd_netdb_fds_t` structure where the file descriptors for `/etc/resolv.conf` and `/etc/hosts` will be stored if the function succeeds.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if either `fd_etc_hosts_fd` or `fd_etc_resolv_conf_fd` is already open (i.e., not -1); if so, return NULL immediately.
    - Attempt to open `/etc/resolv.conf` in read-only mode; if unsuccessful, log an error and terminate the program.
    - Store the file descriptor of `/etc/resolv.conf` in `fd_etc_resolv_conf_fd`.
    - Attempt to open `/etc/hosts` in read-only mode; if unsuccessful, log a warning but continue execution.
    - If successful, store the file descriptor of `/etc/hosts` in `fd_etc_hosts_fd`.
    - If `fds` is not NULL, populate it with the file descriptors for `/etc/resolv.conf` and `/etc/hosts`.
    - Return the `fds` pointer.
- **Output**: Returns the `fds` pointer populated with file descriptors for `/etc/resolv.conf` and `/etc/hosts`, or NULL if the file descriptors were already open.
