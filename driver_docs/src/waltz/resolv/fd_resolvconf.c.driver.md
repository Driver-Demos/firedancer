# Purpose
The provided C code is a function named [`fd_get_resolv_conf`](#fd_get_resolv_conf), which is designed to parse the system's DNS resolver configuration file, typically located at `/etc/resolv.conf`. This function reads the file to extract DNS configuration parameters such as the number of dots in domain names before an initial absolute query (`ndots`), the number of attempts to resolve a query (`attempts`), and the timeout duration for queries (`timeout`). Additionally, it identifies and stores the IP addresses of DNS nameservers specified in the file. The function initializes these parameters with default values and updates them based on the file's content, ensuring that the configuration is correctly set even if the file is not accessible or lacks certain entries.

The function is part of a broader system, as indicated by its inclusion of various headers and utility functions from a larger codebase. It relies on buffered input streams to efficiently read the file and uses string manipulation functions to parse the configuration lines. The function is robust against malformed lines by ignoring truncated lines and setting reasonable limits on configuration values. If no nameservers are found, it defaults to using the local loopback address (`127.0.0.1`). This code is likely part of a library or module that deals with network configuration, providing a specific utility to read and interpret DNS settings for other components in the system.

# Functions

---
### fd\_get\_resolv\_conf<!-- {{#callable:fd_get_resolv_conf}} -->
The `fd_get_resolv_conf` function reads and parses the system's `/etc/resolv.conf` file to configure DNS resolution settings in a `fd_resolvconf_t` structure.
- **Inputs**:
    - `conf`: A pointer to a `fd_resolvconf_t` structure where the DNS configuration will be stored.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize default values for `ndots`, `timeout`, and `attempts` in the `conf` structure.
    - Check if the file descriptor `fd_etc_resolv_conf_fd` is valid; if not, jump to `no_resolv_conf` label.
    - Attempt to seek to the beginning of the `/etc/resolv.conf` file; log an error if it fails.
    - Initialize a buffered input stream to read from the file descriptor.
    - Read each line from the file using [`fd_io_fgets`](fd_io_readline.c.driver.md#fd_io_fgets) and handle errors appropriately.
    - For lines starting with 'options', parse and update `ndots`, `attempts`, and `timeout` values if specified.
    - For lines starting with 'nameserver', parse and store the IP address if the maximum number of nameservers (`MAXNS`) is not exceeded.
    - If no nameservers are found, default to using `127.0.0.1` as the nameserver.
    - Set the number of nameservers found (`nns`) in the `conf` structure.
- **Output**: Returns 0 after successfully reading and parsing the `/etc/resolv.conf` file or using default values.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`fd_io_fgets`](fd_io_readline.c.driver.md#fd_io_fgets)
