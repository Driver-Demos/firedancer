# Purpose
This C source code file is designed to perform network address resolution for given hostnames, demonstrating a specific functionality related to network programming. The code includes necessary headers for network operations and defines a function [`test_gai`](#test_gai) that utilizes the `fd_getaddrinfo` function to resolve hostnames into network addresses. The resolved addresses are then printed in either IPv4 or IPv6 format, depending on the address family. The code is structured as an executable program, with a [`main`](#main) function that iterates over command-line arguments, treating each as a hostname to be resolved and processed by [`test_gai`](#test_gai).

The file leverages custom data structures and functions, such as `fd_addrinfo_t` and `fd_getaddrinfo`, which are likely defined in the included "fd_netdb.h" and "fd_ip4.h" headers. These components suggest that the code is part of a larger library or framework focused on network database operations. The use of `fd_netdb_open_fds` at the beginning of the [`main`](#main) function indicates an initialization step for network database operations, which is crucial for the subsequent address resolution tasks. Overall, the code provides a focused utility for converting hostnames to their respective network addresses, showcasing the integration of custom network handling functions with standard socket programming techniques.

# Functions

---
### test\_gai<!-- {{#callable:test_gai}} -->
The `test_gai` function performs a DNS lookup for a given hostname and prints the resolved IP addresses in both IPv4 and IPv6 formats.
- **Inputs**:
    - `host`: A constant character pointer representing the hostname to be resolved.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function begins by printing the provided hostname using `puts`.
    - It declares a static buffer `scratch` and initializes a pointer `pscratch` to point to this buffer.
    - The function calls [`fd_getaddrinfo`](fd_getaddrinfo.c.driver.md#fd_getaddrinfo) to perform a DNS lookup for the given hostname, storing the result in `res` and using `pscratch` for scratch space.
    - If [`fd_getaddrinfo`](fd_getaddrinfo.c.driver.md#fd_getaddrinfo) returns a non-zero error code, the function prints an error message using [`fd_gai_strerror`](fd_getaddrinfo.c.driver.md#fd_gai_strerror) and returns early.
    - If the lookup is successful, the function enters a loop to iterate over the linked list of address information structures pointed to by `res`.
    - For each address, it checks the address family (`sa_family`) to determine if it is IPv4 or IPv6.
    - If the address is IPv4 (`AF_INET`), it casts the address to `sockaddr_in` and prints the IPv4 address using `FD_IP4_ADDR_FMT` and `FD_IP4_ADDR_FMT_ARGS`.
    - If the address is IPv6 (`AF_INET6`), it casts the address to `sockaddr_in6`, converts it to a string using `inet_ntop`, and prints it.
    - The loop continues until all address information structures have been processed.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it outputs the resolved IP addresses to the standard output.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`fd_getaddrinfo`](fd_getaddrinfo.c.driver.md#fd_getaddrinfo)
    - [`fd_gai_strerror`](fd_getaddrinfo.c.driver.md#fd_gai_strerror)

### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function initializes network database file descriptors and processes each command-line argument as a hostname to resolve its address information.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The count of command-line arguments passed to the program, including the program name.
    - `argv`: An array of strings representing the command-line arguments, where each element is a string containing one argument.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Call `fd_netdb_open_fds` with `NULL` to initialize network database file descriptors.
    - Iterate over each command-line argument starting from index 1 (skipping the program name).
    - For each argument, call [`test_gai`](#test_gai) to resolve the hostname and print its address information.
    - Return 0 to indicate successful execution.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer value of 0, indicating successful execution.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`test_gai`](#test_gai)
