# Purpose
This C header file defines a set of macros for constructing eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter) assembly instructions. It provides symbolic names for eBPF registers and macros to generate machine code for various eBPF operations, such as loading data, performing arithmetic operations, and conditional jumps. The macros abstract the complexity of encoding eBPF instructions by allowing developers to specify operations in a more readable format, which is then translated into the appropriate binary representation. This file is likely part of a larger system that involves eBPF program generation or manipulation, facilitating the creation of eBPF bytecode for network packet filtering or other kernel-level tasks.
