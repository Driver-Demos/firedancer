# Purpose
The provided content is a Makefile, which is used to automate the build process of a software project. This Makefile includes directives for adding header files and object files to the build process, specifically for components like `fd_http_server` and `fd_picohttpparser`. It outlines a sequence for applying a local patch to the `picohttpparser` source file, compiling it into an object file, and then cleaning up temporary files. Additionally, the Makefile defines unit tests for components such as `test_http_server` and `test_live_http_server`, and conditional fuzz tests for `fuzz_picohttpparser`, `fuzz_httpserver`, and `fuzz_url_parse`, which are executed if the `FD_HAS_HOSTED` flag is set. This setup ensures that the software is built, tested, and verified efficiently, maintaining code quality and functionality.
