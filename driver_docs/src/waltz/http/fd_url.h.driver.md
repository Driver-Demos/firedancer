# Purpose
This code is a C header file that defines a basic API for handling and parsing URLs. It introduces a structure, `fd_url_t`, which is used to store pointers to different components of a URL, such as the scheme, host, port, and the remaining path, query, or fragment. The header also defines several error codes to indicate parsing issues, such as unsupported schemes or oversized hostnames. The primary function, [`fd_url_parse_cstr`](#fd_url_parse_cstr), is a simple URL parser that extracts these components from a given URL string, although it is limited in scope and not fully compliant with RFC standards, supporting only basic HTTP and HTTPS schemes and ignoring user information and other complex URL features. This file is intended for use in applications that require basic URL parsing capabilities without the need for full compliance with URL specifications.

### fd\_url\_parse\_cstr
- **Type**: `function`
- **Description**: `fd_url_parse_cstr` is a function that serves as a basic URL parser, designed to parse URLs into their components such as scheme, host, port, and tail. It is not compliant with the full RFC specifications for URLs and has limitations, such as only supporting HTTP and HTTPS schemes and ignoring userinfo and anything after the authority in the URL.
- **Use**: This function is used to parse a URL string into its components and store them in an `fd_url_t` structure, with an optional error code output.


# Data Structures

---
### fd\_url
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `scheme`: A pointer to a constant character string representing the URL scheme.
    - `scheme_len`: An unsigned long integer representing the length of the scheme string.
    - `host`: A pointer to a constant character string representing the URL host.
    - `host_len`: An unsigned long integer representing the length of the host string, with a maximum of 255.
    - `port`: A pointer to a constant character string representing the URL port.
    - `port_len`: An unsigned long integer representing the length of the port string.
    - `tail`: A pointer to a constant character string representing the path, query, and fragment of the URL.
    - `tail_len`: An unsigned long integer representing the length of the tail string.
- **Description**: The `fd_url` structure is designed to hold various components of a URL, such as the scheme, host, port, and the tail (which includes the path, query, and fragment). Each component is represented by a pointer to a constant character string and its corresponding length as an unsigned long integer. This structure is part of a basic URL handling API that is not fully compliant with URL standards, supporting only basic string parsing and limited to certain schemes like HTTP and HTTPS.

### fd\_url\_t
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `scheme`: A pointer to the scheme part of the URL string.
    - `scheme_len`: The length of the scheme part of the URL.
    - `host`: A pointer to the host part of the URL string.
    - `host_len`: The length of the host part of the URL, with a maximum of 255.
    - `port`: A pointer to the port part of the URL string.
    - `port_len`: The length of the port part of the URL.
    - `tail`: A pointer to the tail part of the URL, which includes path, query, and fragment.
    - `tail_len`: The length of the tail part of the URL.
- **Description**: The `fd_url_t` structure is designed to hold various components of a URL string, such as the scheme, host, port, and tail, each represented by a pointer to the respective part of the URL and its length. This structure is used in conjunction with a basic URL parsing function, `fd_url_parse_cstr`, which extracts these components from a given URL string. However, the parser is limited in functionality, supporting only HTTP and HTTPS schemes, and does not handle userinfo or any components beyond the authority.


# Function Declarations (Public API)

---
### fd\_url\_parse\_cstr<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_url_parse_cstr}} -->
Parses a URL string into its components.
- **Description**: Use this function to parse a URL string into its constituent parts, such as scheme, host, and port. It supports only 'http' and 'https' schemes and does not handle userinfo or any components beyond the authority. The function must be called with a valid URL string and its length. It returns a pointer to a populated fd_url_t structure on success or NULL on failure. If an error occurs and opt_err is provided, it will contain an error code indicating the type of failure.
- **Inputs**:
    - `url`: A pointer to an fd_url_t structure where the parsed URL components will be stored. The caller must allocate this structure before calling the function.
    - `url_str`: A pointer to a constant character string representing the URL to be parsed. The string must be at least 8 characters long to accommodate the shortest supported scheme ('http://').
    - `url_str_len`: The length of the URL string. It must accurately reflect the length of url_str.
    - `opt_err`: An optional pointer to an integer where an error code will be stored if parsing fails. If NULL, errors are not reported to the caller.
- **Output**: Returns a pointer to the fd_url_t structure containing the parsed URL components on success, or NULL if parsing fails.
- **See also**: [`fd_url_parse_cstr`](fd_url.c.driver.md#fd_url_parse_cstr)  (Implementation)
