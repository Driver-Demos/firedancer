# Purpose
This Python script is designed to interact with a local server running on port 4321, utilizing both HTTP and WebSocket protocols. The script performs three main tasks: it first sends 5000 HTTP GET requests to a specific endpoint (`/hello/from/the/magic/tavern`) and prints the response content. Next, it sends 20 HTTP POST requests with a JSON-RPC payload to the server, requesting account information for a specific account identifier, and prints the parsed JSON response. Finally, it establishes a WebSocket connection to the server and subscribes to a service using the `slotSubscribe` method, continuously receiving and printing messages from the server.

The script demonstrates a combination of synchronous and asynchronous programming paradigms. It uses the `requests` library for synchronous HTTP requests and the `websockets` library for asynchronous WebSocket communication. The use of JSON-RPC indicates that the server supports remote procedure calls over HTTP and WebSocket, allowing for structured communication. This script is likely intended for testing or interacting with a local server that provides specific services, such as account information retrieval and real-time updates via WebSocket. It does not define public APIs or external interfaces, as it is primarily focused on client-side operations.
# Imports and Dependencies

- `json`


# Functions

---
### hello<!-- {{#callable:firedancer/src/waltz/http/test_live_http_server.hello}} -->
The `hello` function establishes a WebSocket connection to a local server and continuously sends a JSON-RPC request to subscribe to slot updates, printing the received responses.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function defines a WebSocket URI pointing to 'ws://localhost:4321'.
    - It establishes an asynchronous WebSocket connection to the specified URI using `websockets.connect`.
    - A JSON-RPC request object is created with method 'slotSubscribe'.
    - The JSON-RPC request is sent over the WebSocket connection.
    - The function enters an infinite loop where it waits for messages from the WebSocket, decodes them from JSON, and prints them in a pretty-printed format.
- **Output**: The function does not return any value; it continuously prints the received WebSocket messages.
