# Purpose
This C source code file is designed to test the functionality of an HTTP server, specifically focusing on the server's ability to handle and manage data staging and output buffering. The file includes a function [`test_oring`](#test_oring) that sets up parameters and callbacks for an HTTP server instance, then performs a series of tests to verify the server's behavior when handling staged data. The tests involve writing data to the server's output buffer, checking the buffer's state, and ensuring that the data is correctly staged and unstaged. The code uses assertions (`FD_TEST`) to validate that the server's internal state and data handling meet expected conditions, such as buffer offsets and data integrity.

The file is structured as an executable C program, with a [`main`](#main) function that initializes the environment, calls the [`test_oring`](#test_oring) function, and logs the test results. The inclusion of headers like `fd_http_server.h` and `fd_http_server_private.h` suggests that this code is part of a larger project involving HTTP server functionality, and it relies on external utilities from `fd_util.h`. The primary purpose of this file is to ensure the robustness and correctness of the HTTP server's data handling mechanisms, making it a critical component for testing and validating server behavior in a controlled environment.

### test\_oring<!-- {{#callable:test_oring}} -->
The `test_oring` function tests the behavior of an HTTP server's output ring buffer by simulating various scenarios of data staging and unstaging.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize `fd_http_server_params_t` and `fd_http_server_callbacks_t` structures with specific parameters and null callbacks respectively.
    - Allocate a scratch buffer and verify its size using [`fd_http_server_footprint`](fd_http_server.c.driver.md#fd_http_server_footprint).
    - Create and join a new HTTP server instance using [`fd_http_server_new`](fd_http_server.c.driver.md#fd_http_server_new) and [`fd_http_server_join`](fd_http_server.c.driver.md#fd_http_server_join).
    - Set `stage_off` to 6 and print characters 'A', 'B', 'C' to the server, then verify the stage offset, length, and content of the output ring buffer.
    - Unstage the server to reset the output ring buffer.
    - Iterate over a range of values to test the server's response to different lengths of staged data, checking the behavior of [`fd_http_server_stage_body`](fd_http_server.c.driver.md#fd_http_server_stage_body) and verifying the content of the output ring buffer.
    - Perform additional tests with specific `stage_off` values and data to further verify the server's output ring buffer behavior.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value but uses assertions to verify the correct behavior of the HTTP server's output ring buffer.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`fd_http_server_footprint`](fd_http_server.c.driver.md#fd_http_server_footprint)
    - [`fd_http_server_join`](fd_http_server.c.driver.md#fd_http_server_join)
    - [`fd_http_server_new`](fd_http_server.c.driver.md#fd_http_server_new)
    - [`fd_http_server_printf`](fd_http_server.c.driver.md#fd_http_server_printf)
    - [`fd_http_server_unstage`](fd_http_server.c.driver.md#fd_http_server_unstage)
    - [`fd_http_server_stage_body`](fd_http_server.c.driver.md#fd_http_server_stage_body)

### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function initializes the environment, runs a test on the HTTP server's output ring buffer, logs a success message, and then halts the program.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The count of command-line arguments passed to the program.
    - `argv`: An array of strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Call `fd_boot` to initialize the environment with command-line arguments.
    - Invoke [`test_oring`](#test_oring) to perform tests on the HTTP server's output ring buffer functionality.
    - Log a notice message indicating the test passed using `FD_LOG_NOTICE`.
    - Call `fd_halt` to clean up and terminate the program.
    - Return 0 to indicate successful execution.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer value of 0, indicating successful execution.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`test_oring`](#test_oring)
