# Purpose
The provided C code defines a function [`fd_url_parse_cstr`](#fd_url_parse_cstr) that is responsible for parsing a URL string into its constituent components, specifically focusing on the scheme, host, and port. This function is part of a broader URL parsing utility, as indicated by the inclusion of the header file "fd_url.h" and the use of the `fd_url_t` structure, which likely represents a URL object. The function takes a URL string and its length as input, along with an optional error pointer, and populates an `fd_url_t` structure with the parsed components. It supports both "http" and "https" schemes and checks for the presence of a port number, while also ensuring that the host length does not exceed 255 characters. The function returns a pointer to the populated `fd_url_t` structure or `NULL` if an error occurs, such as an unsupported scheme or userinfo in the authority component.

This code provides a narrow functionality focused on URL parsing, specifically designed to handle basic URL components without support for userinfo or complex path parsing. The function is likely intended to be part of a library that can be imported and used in other C programs requiring URL parsing capabilities. It does not define a public API or external interface directly but rather serves as an internal utility function that contributes to the broader functionality of URL handling within the application or library it belongs to. The use of error codes and optional error reporting allows for robust error handling, making it suitable for integration into larger systems where URL validation and parsing are necessary.

# Functions

### fd\_url\_parse\_cstr<!-- {{#callable:fd_url_parse_cstr}} -->
The `fd_url_parse_cstr` function parses a URL string into its components, such as scheme, host, and port, and stores them in a `fd_url_t` structure.
- **Inputs**:
    - `url`: A pointer to an `fd_url_t` structure where the parsed URL components will be stored.
    - `url_str`: A constant character pointer to the URL string to be parsed.
    - `url_str_len`: An unsigned long integer representing the length of the URL string.
    - `opt_err`: An optional pointer to an integer where error codes will be stored; if NULL, a local error variable is used.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize a local error variable if `opt_err` is NULL and set the error code to `FD_URL_SUCCESS`.
    - Check if the URL string length is less than 8; if so, return NULL as it cannot be a valid URL.
    - Determine the scheme by checking if the URL starts with 'http://' or 'https://'; set the scheme length accordingly or return an error if neither is found.
    - Identify the authority section of the URL by moving past the scheme.
    - Iterate through the authority section to find the end of the authority or detect unsupported userinfo, returning an error if userinfo is found.
    - Calculate the length of the authority section.
    - Within the authority, search for a colon to separate the host and port; adjust host and port lengths accordingly.
    - Check if the host length exceeds 255 characters and return an error if it does.
    - Populate the `fd_url_t` structure with the parsed components: scheme, host, port, and the remaining URL tail.
    - Return the populated `fd_url_t` structure.
- **Output**: A pointer to the `fd_url_t` structure containing the parsed URL components, or NULL if an error occurs.
