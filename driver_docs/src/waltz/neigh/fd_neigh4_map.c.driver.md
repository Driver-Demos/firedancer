# Purpose
This C source code file is designed to handle operations related to a data structure that maps IPv4 addresses to Ethernet MAC addresses, specifically within a hosted environment. The file includes necessary headers and definitions for managing this mapping, such as `fd_neigh4_map.h` and `fd_neigh4_map_defines.h`, which likely contain the function prototypes and constant definitions needed for the map's operations. The code utilizes a template-based approach to implement the map, as indicated by the inclusion of `fd_map_slot_para.c` with a specific implementation style defined by `MAP_IMPL_STYLE 2`. This suggests a modular design where different map implementations can be selected or configured.

The primary functionality provided by this file is the [`fd_neigh4_hmap_fprintf`](#fd_neigh4_hmap_fprintf) function, which outputs the contents of the IPv4-to-MAC address map to a specified file stream. This function iterates over the map's entries, performing speculative reads and checks to ensure data integrity before printing each valid mapping. The use of speculative reads and checks for overruns indicates a focus on performance and reliability, ensuring that only valid and complete data is printed. The function is designed to be used in environments where the `FD_HAS_HOSTED` macro is defined, suggesting that it is part of a larger system that can operate in different environments, with this particular functionality being specific to hosted systems.

# Functions

---
### fd\_neigh4\_hmap\_fprintf<!-- {{#callable:fd_neigh4_hmap_fprintf}} -->
The function `fd_neigh4_hmap_fprintf` iterates over a hash map of IPv4 to MAC address entries and prints each valid entry to a specified file.
- **Inputs**:
    - `map`: A pointer to a constant `fd_neigh4_hmap_t` structure representing the hash map of IPv4 to MAC address entries.
    - `file_`: A void pointer that is cast to a `FILE` pointer, representing the file where the entries will be printed.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Retrieve the maximum number of elements (`ele_max`) and the element array (`ele`) from the hash map using `fd_neigh4_hmap_ele_max` and `fd_neigh4_hmap_shele_const` respectively.
    - Iterate over each element in the hash map up to `ele_max`.
    - For each element, extract the IPv4 address (`ip4_addr`) and attempt a speculative read using `fd_neigh4_hmap_query_try`.
    - If the speculative read is unsuccessful, continue to the next element.
    - Copy the queried entry to a local variable `e` using `memcpy`.
    - Check if the read was overrun using `fd_neigh4_hmap_query_test`; if so, continue to the next element.
    - If the entry's IPv4 address is valid, print the IPv4 and MAC address to the file using `fprintf`.
    - If `fprintf` fails, return the error number `errno`.
- **Output**: Returns 0 on success, or an error number if `fprintf` fails.
