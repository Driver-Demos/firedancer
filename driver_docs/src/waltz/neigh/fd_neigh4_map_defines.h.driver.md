# Purpose
This code is a configuration header file for a hash map implementation in C, specifically tailored for handling IPv4 neighbor entries. It defines several macros that configure the hash map's characteristics, such as `MAP_NAME` for the map's identifier, `MAP_ELE_T` for the type of elements stored in the map, and `MAP_KEY_T` for the type of the keys, which are unsigned integers (`uint`). The `MAP_KEY` macro specifies that the key is an IPv4 address (`ip4_addr`), and `MAP_KEY_HASH` defines a hashing function that combines the key and a seed using a bitwise XOR operation, followed by a call to `fd_uint_hash` to generate a hash value. This setup is likely part of a larger system for managing network neighbor information efficiently.
