# Purpose
This C source code file is designed to manage and manipulate HTTP/2 header fields, specifically focusing on matching and inserting header entries into a data structure. The code provides a specialized functionality for handling HTTP/2 headers, which is a crucial part of HTTP/2 protocol implementations. The file includes functions to initialize and finalize a header matcher, insert header entries, and manage a static table of header fields. The [`fd_h2_hdr_matcher_init`](#fd_h2_hdr_matcher_init) function initializes a header matcher with a given memory block and seed, setting up the necessary data structures for header management. The [`fd_h2_hdr_matcher_insert`](#fd_h2_hdr_matcher_insert) function allows for the insertion of new header entries into the matcher, ensuring that the entries are within valid bounds and do not exceed predefined limits.

The code relies on several key components, such as `fd_h2_hdr_match_entry_t` and `fd_h2_hdr_matcher_t` structures, which are used to store header information and manage the matcher state, respectively. It also utilizes a static array `fd_h2_hpack_matcher` to map header IDs to specific HTTP/2 header fields, facilitating quick lookups and efficient header management. The file is not a standalone executable but rather a part of a larger library or module intended to be integrated into an HTTP/2 implementation. It does not define public APIs or external interfaces directly but provides internal mechanisms for header management, likely to be used by other components within the same library or application.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `fd_h2_hdr_match.h`
- `fd_hpack_private.h`


# Global Variables

---
### fd\_h2\_hdr\_match\_seed
- **Type**: `ulong`
- **Description**: The `fd_h2_hdr_match_seed` is a global variable of type `ulong` that is used to store a seed value for header matching operations in the HTTP/2 header matcher. This seed is likely used to initialize or influence the behavior of the header matching process, potentially for purposes such as randomization or ensuring unique hash values.
- **Use**: This variable is set during the initialization of the header matcher and is used to maintain consistency in header matching operations.


---
### fd\_h2\_hdr\_match\_entry\_null
- **Type**: `fd_h2_hdr_match_entry_t const`
- **Description**: The variable `fd_h2_hdr_match_entry_null` is a constant of type `fd_h2_hdr_match_entry_t` initialized to zero. This suggests it is used as a default or null entry in header matching operations.
- **Use**: It serves as a placeholder or default value for header match entries, likely used to signify an uninitialized or empty state in header matching logic.


---
### fd\_h2\_hpack\_matcher
- **Type**: `schar const[62]`
- **Description**: The `fd_h2_hpack_matcher` is a globally defined constant array of signed characters, aligned to 16 bytes, with a size of 62 elements. Each element in the array corresponds to a specific HTTP/2 header field identifier, represented by predefined constants such as `FD_H2_HDR_AUTHORITY`, `FD_H2_HDR_METHOD`, etc. This array is used to map indices to specific HTTP/2 header fields, facilitating the process of header field matching and identification in HTTP/2 header compression and decompression.
- **Use**: This variable is used to map indices to specific HTTP/2 header field identifiers for efficient header field matching.


# Functions

---
### fd\_h2\_hdr\_matcher\_insert1<!-- {{#callable:fd_h2_hdr_matcher_insert1}} -->
The `fd_h2_hdr_matcher_insert1` function inserts a header entry into a map with a specified ID and name.
- **Inputs**:
    - `map`: A pointer to the header match entry map where the new entry will be inserted.
    - `id`: An integer representing the ID to be associated with the header entry.
    - `name`: A constant character pointer to the name of the header, which has a static lifetime.
    - `name_len`: An unsigned long representing the length of the header name.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Create a key of type `fd_h2_hdr_match_key_t` using the provided name and name length.
    - Attempt to insert the key into the map using `fd_h2_hdr_map_insert`.
    - If the insertion fails (i.e., `entry` is NULL), return NULL.
    - If the insertion is successful, set the `id` of the entry to the provided ID and return the entry.
- **Output**: Returns a pointer to the inserted `fd_h2_hdr_match_entry_t` if successful, or NULL if the insertion fails.


---
### fd\_h2\_hdr\_matcher\_init<!-- {{#callable:fd_h2_hdr_matcher_init}} -->
The `fd_h2_hdr_matcher_init` function initializes an HTTP/2 header matcher structure with a given memory location and seed, setting up a map of header entries for efficient lookup.
- **Inputs**:
    - `mem`: A pointer to a memory location where the `fd_h2_hdr_matcher_t` structure will be initialized.
    - `seed`: An unsigned long integer used to seed the matcher for header entry operations.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if the `mem` pointer is NULL and log a warning if so, returning NULL.
    - Check if the `mem` pointer is properly aligned for `fd_h2_hdr_matcher_t` and log a warning if not, returning NULL.
    - Cast the `mem` pointer to `fd_h2_hdr_matcher_t` and attempt to initialize a new header map; return NULL if this fails.
    - Set the `seed` and `entry_cnt` fields of the matcher and update the global `fd_h2_hdr_match_seed`.
    - Iterate over a predefined set of header IDs, inserting unique headers into the map using [`fd_h2_hdr_matcher_insert1`](#fd_h2_hdr_matcher_insert1).
    - Insert additional specific WebSocket-related headers into the map.
    - Return the initialized `fd_h2_hdr_matcher_t` structure.
- **Output**: Returns a pointer to the initialized `fd_h2_hdr_matcher_t` structure, or NULL if initialization fails due to invalid input or memory alignment issues.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`fd_h2_hdr_matcher_insert1`](#fd_h2_hdr_matcher_insert1)


---
### fd\_h2\_hdr\_matcher\_fini<!-- {{#callable:fd_h2_hdr_matcher_fini}} -->
The `fd_h2_hdr_matcher_fini` function returns the input `matcher` pointer without performing any additional operations.
- **Inputs**:
    - `matcher`: A pointer to an `fd_h2_hdr_matcher_t` structure, which is intended to be finalized or cleaned up.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function takes a single argument, `matcher`, which is a pointer to an `fd_h2_hdr_matcher_t` structure.
    - It immediately returns the `matcher` pointer without any modification or additional logic.
- **Output**: The function returns the same `fd_h2_hdr_matcher_t` pointer that was passed as input.


---
### fd\_h2\_hdr\_matcher\_insert<!-- {{#callable:fd_h2_hdr_matcher_insert}} -->
The `fd_h2_hdr_matcher_insert` function inserts a header entry into a matcher structure, ensuring constraints on the ID, entry count, and name length are met.
- **Inputs**:
    - `matcher`: A pointer to an `fd_h2_hdr_matcher_t` structure where the header entry will be inserted.
    - `id`: An integer representing the ID of the header entry to be inserted, which must be between 1 and `SHORT_MAX`.
    - `name`: A constant character pointer to the name of the header, which must have a static lifetime.
    - `name_len`: An unsigned long representing the length of the header name, which must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to `USHORT_MAX`.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if the `id` is within the valid range (1 to `SHORT_MAX`); log an error if not.
    - Check if the `matcher`'s entry count has reached `FD_H2_HDR_MATCH_MAX`; log an error if it has.
    - Check if `name_len` is valid (greater than 0 and less than or equal to `USHORT_MAX`); log an error if not.
    - Set the global `fd_h2_hdr_match_seed` to the matcher's seed value.
    - Attempt to insert the header entry using [`fd_h2_hdr_matcher_insert1`](#fd_h2_hdr_matcher_insert1); if unsuccessful, return immediately.
    - Increment the matcher's entry count if the insertion is successful.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it modifies the `matcher` structure in place.
