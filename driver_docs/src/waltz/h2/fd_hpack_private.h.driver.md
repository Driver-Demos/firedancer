# Purpose
This C header file, `fd_hpack_private.h`, is part of a library that deals with HPACK, a compression format used in HTTP/2 for efficient header field representation. The file provides internal functionality specific to handling HPACK static tables and variable-length integer encoding, which are crucial components of the HPACK specification. The static table is a predefined set of header fields that can be referenced by index, reducing the size of transmitted headers. The file defines a structure, `fd_hpack_static_entry_t`, to represent entries in this static table, and declares an array, `fd_hpack_static_table`, which holds these entries.

Additionally, the file includes a static inline function, [`fd_hpack_rd_varint`](#fd_hpack_rd_varint), which is responsible for reading variable-length integers from a data stream. This function is optimized for performance, with considerations for different CPU architectures, such as x86, and includes mechanisms to handle potential decoding errors. The function reads a variable-length integer, which is a common operation in HPACK encoding and decoding, and returns the decoded value or an error indicator. The file is intended for internal use within the library, as indicated by its private nature, and does not define public APIs or external interfaces.
# Imports and Dependencies

- `fd_hpack.h`
- `immintrin.h`


# Global Variables

---
### fd\_hpack\_static\_table
- **Type**: `fd_hpack_static_entry_t const[62]`
- **Description**: The `fd_hpack_static_table` is an array of 62 constant entries, each of type `fd_hpack_static_entry_t`, which represents a simple HPACK static table. Each entry in the table contains a pointer to a character string (`entry`), and two unsigned characters representing the lengths of the name and value (`name_len` and `value_len`).
- **Use**: This variable is used to store predefined static entries for HPACK header compression, which can be accessed globally throughout the program.


# Data Structures

---
### fd\_hpack\_static\_entry
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `entry`: A pointer to a constant character string representing the entry.
    - `name_len`: An unsigned character representing the length of the name.
    - `value_len`: An unsigned character representing the length of the value.
- **Description**: The `fd_hpack_static_entry` structure is used to represent an entry in the HPACK static table, which is part of the HTTP/2 header compression mechanism. Each entry consists of a pointer to a string (`entry`) and two unsigned characters (`name_len` and `value_len`) that store the lengths of the name and value components of the entry, respectively. This structure is designed to facilitate efficient storage and retrieval of static header fields in HTTP/2 communications.

    - `name_len`: An unsigned character representing the length of the name in the entry.
    - `value_len`: An unsigned character representing the length of the value in the entry.

# Functions

---
### fd\_hpack\_rd\_varint<!-- {{#callable:fd_hpack_rd_varint}} -->
The `fd_hpack_rd_varint` function reads a variable-length integer from a source buffer, using a specified prefix and addend, and returns the decoded integer or an error code on failure.
- **Inputs**:
    - `rd`: A pointer to an `fd_hpack_rd_t` structure, which contains the source buffer and its end.
    - `prefix`: An unsigned integer representing the prefix of the variable-length integer.
    - `addend`: An unsigned integer representing the maximum value of the prefix, typically (2^n)-1 where n is the number of prefix bits.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function first masks the prefix with the addend to ensure it is within the valid range.
    - If the prefix is less than the addend, it returns the prefix as the result, indicating a zero-length varint.
    - It attempts to read an 8-byte encoded word from the source buffer, using a fast path if enough bytes are available, or a slow path with careful copying if not.
    - It calculates the length of the varint by finding the least significant set bit in a bit pattern derived from the encoded word.
    - If the varint is unterminated, it returns `ULONG_MAX` to indicate an error.
    - It masks off any garbage bits from the encoded word and extracts the varint using either a specialized instruction or bit manipulation.
    - It checks if the end of the source buffer is reached and returns `ULONG_MAX` if so, indicating an error.
    - Finally, it updates the source pointer and returns the decoded integer plus the addend.
- **Output**: The function returns the decoded variable-length integer plus the addend, or `ULONG_MAX` on failure (e.g., end of file or unterminated varint).
