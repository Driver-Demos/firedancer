# Purpose
This C source code file is a test suite for various components of an HTTP/2 implementation, specifically focusing on HPACK (header compression) and other HTTP/2 functionalities. It includes several test modules, such as `test_hpack.c`, `test_h2_hdr_match.c`, `test_h2_conn.c`, and `test_h2_proto.c`, which are executed sequentially to verify the correctness of these components. The code conditionally includes and tests `test_h2_rbuf.c` if the `FD_HAS_HOSTED` macro is defined, indicating that some tests are only applicable in certain environments. The program initializes a random number generator for use in the tests, logs the progress of each test, and concludes by logging a "pass" message if all tests are successful. This file serves as a comprehensive testing framework to ensure the reliability and functionality of the HTTP/2 features being developed or maintained.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `../../util/fd_util.h`
- `test_hpack.c`
- `test_h2_rbuf.c`
- `test_h2_hdr_match.c`
- `test_h2_conn.c`
- `test_h2_proto.c`


# Functions

---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function initializes the environment, runs a series of tests on HTTP/2 components, and then cleans up before exiting.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The count of command-line arguments passed to the program.
    - `argv`: An array of strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Call `fd_boot` to initialize the environment with command-line arguments.
    - Create a random number generator instance using `fd_rng_new` and join it with `fd_rng_join`.
    - Log a notice and call [`test_hpack`](test_hpack.c.driver.md#test_hpack) to test HPACK functionality.
    - If `FD_HAS_HOSTED` is defined, log a notice and call [`test_h2_rbuf`](test_h2_rbuf.c.driver.md#test_h2_rbuf) to test HTTP/2 buffer functionality with the random number generator.
    - Log a notice and call [`test_h2_hdr_match`](test_h2_hdr_match.c.driver.md#test_h2_hdr_match) to test HTTP/2 header matching functionality.
    - Log a notice and call [`test_h2_conn`](test_h2_conn.c.driver.md#test_h2_conn) to test HTTP/2 connection functionality.
    - Log a notice and call [`test_h2_proto`](test_h2_proto.c.driver.md#test_h2_proto) to test HTTP/2 protocol functionality.
    - Delete the random number generator instance using `fd_rng_delete` after leaving it with `fd_rng_leave`.
    - Log a notice indicating all tests passed.
    - Call `fd_halt` to perform any necessary cleanup before exiting.
    - Return 0 to indicate successful execution.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer value of 0, indicating successful execution.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`test_hpack`](test_hpack.c.driver.md#test_hpack)
    - [`test_h2_rbuf`](test_h2_rbuf.c.driver.md#test_h2_rbuf)
    - [`test_h2_hdr_match`](test_h2_hdr_match.c.driver.md#test_h2_hdr_match)
    - [`test_h2_conn`](test_h2_conn.c.driver.md#test_h2_conn)
    - [`test_h2_proto`](test_h2_proto.c.driver.md#test_h2_proto)
