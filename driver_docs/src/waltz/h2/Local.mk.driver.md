# Purpose
The provided content is a Makefile, which is used to automate the build process of a software project. This particular Makefile is focused on managing the compilation and testing of components related to HPACK and HTTP/2 protocols. It uses macros to add header files and object files to the build process, ensuring that the necessary components are compiled and linked correctly. The file also includes conditional directives to create and run fuzz tests and unit tests, which are executed if the `FD_HAS_HOSTED` variable is defined, indicating a hosted environment. This setup helps streamline the development and testing of protocol implementations within the project.
