# Purpose
This C source code file is designed to test various aspects of HTTP/2 connection handling, specifically focusing on client-side handshake logic and ping transmission/acknowledgment. The file includes functions that simulate and verify the behavior of an HTTP/2 client during the handshake process, ensuring that the client correctly follows the protocol's sequence of sending and receiving SETTINGS frames and their acknowledgments. The code also tests the client's ability to handle ping frames, including sending pings, handling full transmission buffers, and processing ping acknowledgments.

The file is structured around two main testing functions: [`test_h2_client_handshake`](#test_h2_client_handshake) and [`test_h2_ping_tx`](#test_h2_ping_tx). The [`test_h2_client_handshake`](#test_h2_client_handshake) function exercises the client-side logic for establishing a connection, verifying that the client sends the correct preface and SETTINGS frames, and correctly processes server responses. The [`test_h2_ping_tx`](#test_h2_ping_tx) function tests the client's ability to send ping frames, handle buffer constraints, and process ping acknowledgments. The code uses callback mechanisms to track connection establishment and ping acknowledgment events, ensuring that the client behaves as expected under various conditions. This file is intended to be part of a larger test suite for an HTTP/2 implementation, focusing on validating the correctness and robustness of the client-side connection management logic.

# Global Variables

---
### cb\_rec
- **Type**: ``test_h2_callback_rec_t``
- **Description**: The `cb_rec` variable is a static instance of the `test_h2_callback_rec_t` structure, which contains a single member, `cb_established_cnt`, a counter for the number of times a connection establishment callback is triggered. This structure is used to track the number of successful connection establishments in the HTTP/2 client handshake process.
- **Use**: `cb_rec` is used to increment the `cb_established_cnt` each time a connection is successfully established, providing a count of such events.


---
### test\_h2\_ping\_tx\_ack\_cnt
- **Type**: `ulong`
- **Description**: The `test_h2_ping_tx_ack_cnt` is a static global variable of type `ulong` initialized to zero. It is used to keep track of the number of ping acknowledgments transmitted in the HTTP/2 connection tests.
- **Use**: This variable is incremented each time a ping acknowledgment is successfully processed in the `test_h2_ping_ack` function.


# Data Structures

---
### test\_h2\_callback\_rec
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `cb_established_cnt`: A counter that tracks the number of times a connection has been established.
- **Description**: The `test_h2_callback_rec` structure is used to record the number of times a connection establishment callback is triggered in an HTTP/2 client handshake process. It contains a single member, `cb_established_cnt`, which is an unsigned integer that increments each time a connection is successfully established. This structure is primarily used for testing and validation purposes to ensure that the connection establishment logic is functioning correctly.

- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `cb_established_cnt`: A counter that tracks the number of times a connection has been established.
- **Description**: The `test_h2_callback_rec_t` structure is used to record the number of times a connection establishment callback is triggered in an HTTP/2 client handshake process. It contains a single member, `cb_established_cnt`, which is incremented each time a connection is successfully established, allowing for tracking and testing of connection establishment events.


# Functions

---
### test\_cb\_conn\_established<!-- {{#callable:test_cb_conn_established}} -->
The function `test_cb_conn_established` increments a counter each time a connection is established.
- **Inputs**:
    - `conn`: A pointer to an `fd_h2_conn_t` structure representing the connection that has been established.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function takes a single argument, `conn`, which is a pointer to an `fd_h2_conn_t` structure.
    - The function explicitly ignores the `conn` argument by casting it to void, indicating it is unused.
    - The function increments the `cb_established_cnt` field of the `cb_rec` structure, which tracks the number of established connections.
- **Output**: The function does not return any value; it modifies the global `cb_rec` structure by incrementing its `cb_established_cnt` field.


---
### test\_h2\_client\_handshake<!-- {{#callable:test_h2_client_handshake}} -->
The `test_h2_client_handshake` function tests the client-side HTTP/2 handshake process by simulating different handshake sequences and verifying the correct state transitions and message exchanges.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize buffers and connection structures for testing.
    - Set initial client connection settings and initialize callback structure.
    - Verify the client initiates the connection with the correct flags.

    - Simulate receiving server settings and settings acknowledgment, and verify the client's response and state transitions.
    - Repeat the handshake process with a different sequence of server responses to ensure robustness.
    - Verify that the connection is established correctly by checking callback invocation and connection flags.
