# Purpose
This code is a C header file that serves as an inclusion guard and organizes the inclusion of other related header files for a module, likely dealing with HTTP/2 (H2) protocol functionalities. The file uses preprocessor directives to prevent multiple inclusions, ensuring that the compiler processes the file's contents only once. It includes several other headers, such as `fd_h2_callback.h`, `fd_h2_stream.h`, `fd_h2_tx.h`, and `fd_hpack.h`, which suggest that the module handles callbacks, stream management, transmission, and header compression/decompression (HPACK) in the context of HTTP/2. The commented-out includes indicate potential dependencies that are not currently needed, possibly for modularity or to reduce compilation dependencies.
