# Purpose
This C source code file is designed to test the functionality of HPACK, a compression format used in HTTP/2 for efficiently encoding and decoding HTTP headers. The file includes several static arrays of binary data (`rfc7541_c31_bin`, `rfc7541_c32_bin`, etc.) and their corresponding decoded header representations (`rfc7541_c31_dec`, `rfc7541_c32_dec`, etc.), which are used as test cases to validate the HPACK decoding process. The [`test_hpack_rd`](#test_hpack_rd) function is a key component that initializes an HPACK reader, iterates through the expected headers, and verifies that the decoded headers match the expected values using a series of assertions. This ensures that the HPACK decoding logic correctly interprets the binary data into structured HTTP/2 headers.

Additionally, the file defines and tests variable-length integer encoding and decoding, which is a crucial part of the HPACK specification. The [`test_hpack_rd_varint`](#test_hpack_rd_varint) and [`test_hpack_wr_varint`](#test_hpack_wr_varint) functions test the reading and writing of these variable-length integers, respectively, using a set of predefined test cases (`test_hpack_cases`). These functions ensure that the encoding and decoding of integers are performed correctly, which is essential for the proper functioning of HPACK. Overall, this file serves as a comprehensive test suite for verifying the correctness of HPACK encoding and decoding implementations, ensuring compliance with the HTTP/2 specification.
