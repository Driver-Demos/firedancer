# Purpose
This C source code file is designed to test and validate the functionality of HTTP/2 header matching and indexing, specifically focusing on the HPACK header compression mechanism. The file includes functions that check the correctness of header index matching against a predefined set of HTTP/2 headers, ensuring that the header names and their corresponding indices are correctly identified and matched. The [`check_hpack_idx`](#check_hpack_idx) function is a key component, verifying that the header index corresponds to the expected header name using a series of assertions. The file also includes a comprehensive test suite, [`test_h2_hdr_match`](#test_h2_hdr_match), which initializes a header matcher, performs various sanity checks, and tests the matching of both static and dynamic headers. It also handles edge cases such as hash collisions and invalid inputs, ensuring robustness in the header matching process.

The code is structured to be part of a larger library or application dealing with HTTP/2 header processing, as indicated by the inclusion of specific header files like `fd_h2_hdr_match.h` and `fd_hpack.h`. It does not define a public API but rather serves as an internal testing mechanism to validate the functionality of the header matching components. The use of static assertions and detailed test cases suggests a focus on ensuring the reliability and correctness of the header matching logic, which is crucial for efficient HTTP/2 communication. Additionally, the file includes platform-specific code for testing failure scenarios, indicating its use in a hosted environment, particularly on Linux systems.

# Functions

---
### check\_hpack\_idx<!-- {{#callable:check_hpack_idx}} -->
The `check_hpack_idx` function verifies that a given index corresponds to a specific HTTP/2 header name and length, logging an error if the index is invalid.
- **Inputs**:
    - `idx`: An integer representing the index of the HTTP/2 header to be checked.
    - `name`: A constant character pointer to the name of the HTTP/2 header.
    - `name_idx`: An unsigned long representing the length of the header name.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function uses a switch statement to handle different cases based on the value of `idx`.
    - For each case, it uses a macro to define a test that checks if `name_idx` matches the length of the expected header literal and if `name` matches the expected header literal using `fd_memeq`.
    - If the `idx` does not match any predefined case, the default case logs an error indicating an invalid index.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it performs validation and logs an error if the index is invalid.


---
### test\_h2\_hdr\_match<!-- {{#callable:test_h2_hdr_match}} -->
The `test_h2_hdr_match` function tests the functionality and robustness of the HTTP/2 header matcher, including initialization, querying, insertion, and handling of hash collisions.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize a header matcher and verify its initialization.
    - Perform sanity checks by attempting to initialize the matcher with invalid parameters and restoring the log level.
    - Set a seed for header matching and iterate over a static table to test header matching and index checking.
    - Test specific header names for expected negative index results.
    - Verify that a non-existent header returns a zero index and test insertion of a new header, ensuring it is correctly inserted and matched.
    - Test hash collision handling by inserting headers with colliding hashes and verifying their indices.
    - Under certain conditions, test failure scenarios using a forked process to ensure invalid insertions are handled correctly.
    - Fill the hash map to its maximum capacity and test overflow handling.
    - Finalize the matcher to clean up resources.
- **Output**: The function does not return any value; it performs tests and assertions to validate the header matcher's behavior.
