# Purpose
This C header file is part of a library or module that provides foundational support for HTTP/2 protocol handling. It includes conditional compilation directives to determine whether socket support should be enabled, based on whether the code is being compiled in a hosted environment. The file defines several forward declarations for structures related to HTTP/2 operations, such as callbacks, buffers, connections, and streams, which are likely used elsewhere in the implementation. Additionally, it enumerates a set of HTTP/2 error codes, aligning with the official IANA HTTP/2 parameters, to standardize error handling within the library. The file also declares a function, [`fd_h2_strerror`](#fd_h2_strerror), which returns a string description for these error codes, aiding in debugging and error reporting.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `../../util/bits/fd_bits.h`


# Global Variables

---
### fd\_h2\_strerror
- **Type**: `function pointer`
- **Description**: The `fd_h2_strerror` is a function that returns a constant character string (cstr) with a static lifetime, which provides a brief description of a given HTTP/2 error code defined by the `FD_H2_ERR_*` constants. This function is designed to map error codes to human-readable error messages, facilitating easier debugging and error handling in HTTP/2 implementations.
- **Use**: This function is used to convert HTTP/2 error codes into descriptive strings for logging or debugging purposes.


# Data Structures

---
### fd\_h2\_callbacks\_t
- **Type**: `typedef struct fd_h2_callbacks fd_h2_callbacks_t;`
- **Description**: The `fd_h2_callbacks_t` is a forward-declared structure in the HTTP/2 implementation, which is likely used to define a set of callback functions for handling various events or operations within the HTTP/2 protocol. The actual definition of the structure is not provided in the given code, indicating that it is defined elsewhere, possibly in another file or later in the codebase. This structure is part of a larger framework for managing HTTP/2 connections, streams, and error handling.


---
### fd\_h2\_rbuf\_t
- **Type**: `typedef struct fd_h2_rbuf fd_h2_rbuf_t;`
- **Description**: The `fd_h2_rbuf_t` is a forward-declared data structure in C, which means its detailed definition is not provided in the given code. It is likely used as a type for a buffer related to HTTP/2 operations, as suggested by the naming convention, but further details would require additional code that defines the structure's members and their purposes.


---
### fd\_h2\_conn\_t
- **Type**: `typedef struct fd_h2_conn fd_h2_conn_t;`
- **Description**: The `fd_h2_conn_t` is a forward declaration of a structure named `fd_h2_conn`, which is intended to represent a connection in the context of HTTP/2 protocol handling. This data structure is part of a larger HTTP/2 implementation, as indicated by the surrounding code, which includes error codes and other related structures. The actual definition of `fd_h2_conn` is not provided in the given code, suggesting that it is defined elsewhere, likely containing fields relevant to managing an HTTP/2 connection, such as state information, configuration settings, and possibly references to other related structures like streams or callbacks.


---
### fd\_h2\_stream\_t
- **Type**: `typedef struct fd_h2_stream fd_h2_stream_t;`
- **Description**: The `fd_h2_stream_t` is a forward-declared data structure representing a stream in the HTTP/2 protocol. It is part of a larger HTTP/2 implementation, likely used to manage individual streams within an HTTP/2 connection. The actual definition and members of this structure are not provided in the given code, indicating that it is defined elsewhere, possibly in a separate implementation file.


# Function Declarations (Public API)

---
### fd\_h2\_strerror<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_h2_strerror}} -->
Return a string description for a given HTTP/2 error code.
- **Description**: Use this function to obtain a human-readable string that describes an HTTP/2 error code. This can be useful for logging, debugging, or displaying error messages to users. The function maps known error codes to specific descriptions and returns "unknown" for any unrecognized error codes. It is a constant function, meaning it does not modify any state and always returns the same result for the same input.
- **Inputs**:
    - `err`: An unsigned integer representing an HTTP/2 error code. Valid values are defined as FD_H2_ERR_* constants. If the value does not match any known error code, the function returns "unknown".
- **Output**: A constant character pointer to a string describing the error code. The string is statically allocated and should not be modified or freed by the caller.
- **See also**: [`fd_h2_strerror`](fd_h2_proto.c.driver.md#fd_h2_strerror)  (Implementation)
