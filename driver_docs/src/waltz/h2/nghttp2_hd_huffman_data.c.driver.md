# Purpose
The provided C source code file is part of the nghttp2 library, which is a C library for implementing the HTTP/2 protocol. This specific file is focused on Huffman coding, a compression technique used in HTTP/2 to efficiently encode header fields. The file includes two main components: a Huffman symbol table (`huff_sym_table`) and a Huffman decode table (`huff_decode_table`). These tables are used to encode and decode data using Huffman coding, which is a key part of the HPACK compression format used in HTTP/2 to reduce the size of transmitted headers.

The `huff_sym_table` is an array of `nghttp2_huff_sym` structures, each containing a bit length and a Huffman code, which are used to map characters to their corresponding Huffman codes for encoding. The `huff_decode_table` is a multi-dimensional array of `nghttp2_huff_decode` structures, which are used to decode Huffman-encoded data back into its original form. This file is not an executable but rather a component of the nghttp2 library, intended to be used internally by the library to handle Huffman encoding and decoding operations. It does not define public APIs or external interfaces directly but provides essential functionality for the library's internal operations related to HTTP/2 header compression.
# Imports and Dependencies

- `nghttp2_hd_huffman.h`


# Global Variables

---
### huff\_sym\_table
- **Type**: ``const nghttp2_huff_sym[]``
- **Description**: The `huff_sym_table` is a constant array of `nghttp2_huff_sym` structures, which are used to represent Huffman codes for HTTP/2 header compression. Each element in the array consists of a pair of values: the length of the Huffman code and the code itself, stored as an unsigned integer.
- **Use**: This variable is used to store the Huffman codes and their lengths for efficient encoding and decoding of HTTP/2 headers.


---
### huff\_decode\_table
- **Type**: `const nghttp2_huff_decode`
- **Description**: The `huff_decode_table` is a two-dimensional array of `nghttp2_huff_decode` structures, which is used for Huffman decoding in the nghttp2 library. Each element in the array represents a Huffman code and its corresponding decoded value, organized in a table format to facilitate efficient lookup during the decoding process. The table is indexed by the Huffman code and provides the decoded value and additional information needed for the decoding operation.
- **Use**: This variable is used to decode Huffman-encoded data in the nghttp2 library, enabling efficient compression and decompression of HTTP/2 headers.
