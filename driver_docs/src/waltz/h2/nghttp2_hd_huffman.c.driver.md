# Purpose
This C source code file is part of the nghttp2 library, which is an implementation of the HTTP/2 protocol. The file specifically deals with Huffman decoding, a compression technique used in HTTP/2 to reduce the size of headers. The primary functionality provided by this file is the initialization and execution of Huffman decoding operations. It includes the function [`nghttp2_hd_huff_decode_context_init`](#nghttp2_hd_huff_decode_context_init), which initializes a decoding context, and [`nghttp2_hd_huff_decode`](#nghttp2_hd_huff_decode), which performs the actual decoding of a given input buffer using a predefined Huffman decoding table. The code is designed to handle the decoding process efficiently by iterating over the input data and updating the decoding context state.

The file is intended to be part of a larger library and is not a standalone executable. It includes headers and functions that are likely used by other parts of the nghttp2 library to handle HTTP/2 header compression and decompression. The code is structured to be integrated into the broader nghttp2 library, providing a specific and narrow functionality focused on Huffman decoding. It does not define public APIs or external interfaces directly but rather contributes to the internal workings of the nghttp2 library's header compression mechanism.

# Functions

---
### nghttp2\_hd\_huff\_decode\_context\_init<!-- {{#callable:nghttp2_hd_huff_decode_context_init}} -->
The function `nghttp2_hd_huff_decode_context_init` initializes a Huffman decoding context by setting its state to `NGHTTP2_HUFF_ACCEPTED`.
- **Inputs**:
    - `ctx`: A pointer to an `nghttp2_hd_huff_decode_context` structure that will be initialized.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function sets the `fstate` member of the `ctx` structure to `NGHTTP2_HUFF_ACCEPTED`.
- **Output**: This function does not return a value; it initializes the provided context structure.


---
### nghttp2\_hd\_huff\_decode<!-- {{#callable:nghttp2_hd_huff_decode}} -->
The `nghttp2_hd_huff_decode` function decodes a Huffman-encoded byte sequence into its original form using a specified decoding context and buffer.
- **Inputs**:
    - `ctx`: A pointer to an `nghttp2_hd_huff_decode_context` structure that maintains the current state of the Huffman decoding process.
    - `buf`: A pointer to an `nghttp2_buf` structure where the decoded output will be stored.
    - `src`: A pointer to the source byte array containing the Huffman-encoded data to be decoded.
    - `srclen`: The length of the source byte array `src`.
    - `final`: An integer flag indicating whether this is the final block of data to be decoded (non-zero if final, zero otherwise).
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize the end pointer to the end of the source data and set up the initial decoding node using the current state from the context.
    - Iterate over each byte in the source data until the end is reached.
    - For each byte, perform two decoding steps: first using the higher 4 bits and then the lower 4 bits of the byte, updating the decoding node each time.
    - If a symbol is found during decoding (indicated by the `NGHTTP2_HUFF_SYM` flag), append it to the output buffer.
    - Update the context's state with the final state of the decoding node after processing all input bytes.
    - If the `final` flag is set and the final state is not `NGHTTP2_HUFF_ACCEPTED`, return an error code `NGHTTP2_ERR_HEADER_COMP`.
    - Return the length of the source data as the function's result.
- **Output**: The function returns the number of bytes processed from the source data as an `nghttp2_ssize` type, or an error code `NGHTTP2_ERR_HEADER_COMP` if the final state is not accepted when `final` is set.
