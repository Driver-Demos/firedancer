# Purpose
This C header file is part of the nghttp2 library, which is an implementation of the HTTP/2 protocol. The file specifically deals with Huffman coding, a compression method used in HTTP/2 to reduce the size of transmitted headers. The file defines data structures and functions necessary for decoding Huffman-encoded data. Key components include the `nghttp2_huff_decode` structure, which represents the state of the Huffman decoding process, and the `nghttp2_hd_huff_decode_context` structure, which maintains the current state of the decoding context. The file also declares the [`nghttp2_hd_huff_decode`](#nghttp2_hd_huff_decode) function, which performs the actual decoding of Huffman-encoded data, and several constants and tables used in the decoding process.

The header file provides a narrow functionality focused on Huffman decoding within the broader context of HTTP/2 header compression. It defines public APIs that are intended to be used by other parts of the nghttp2 library or potentially by external applications that need to decode HTTP/2 headers. The file includes type definitions, enumerations, and function prototypes that facilitate the integration of Huffman decoding into the HTTP/2 communication process. The use of external tables, such as `huff_sym_table` and `huff_decode_table`, suggests that the file is part of a larger library where these tables are defined and used to optimize the decoding process.

### huff\_sym\_table
- **Type**: `nghttp2_huff_sym[]`
- **Description**: The `huff_sym_table` is an external constant array of `nghttp2_huff_sym` structures, which represent Huffman symbols used in the HTTP/2 protocol. Each element in the array contains a Huffman code and the number of bits in that code, aligned to the least significant bit (LSB).
- **Use**: This variable is used to store the Huffman symbols and their corresponding codes for encoding purposes in the HTTP/2 protocol.


---
### huff\_decode\_table
- **Type**: `nghttp2_huff_decode[][]`
- **Description**: The `huff_decode_table` is a two-dimensional array of `nghttp2_huff_decode` structures, which are used in the Huffman decoding process within the nghttp2 library. Each element in the array represents a state in the Huffman decoding finite state machine, with each state containing information about the current decoding state and the symbol to be emitted if applicable.
- **Use**: This variable is used to facilitate the decoding of Huffman encoded data by providing a lookup table for the decoding states and symbols.


# Data Structures

---
### nghttp2\_huff\_decode\_flag
- **Type**: `enum`
- **Members**:
    - `NGHTTP2_HUFF_ACCEPTED`: This flag indicates that the finite state automaton (FSA) accepts this state as the end of a Huffman encoding sequence.
    - `NGHTTP2_HUFF_SYM`: This flag indicates that the state emits a symbol.
- **Description**: The `nghttp2_huff_decode_flag` is an enumeration used in the nghttp2 library to represent flags for Huffman decoding states. It defines two flags: `NGHTTP2_HUFF_ACCEPTED`, which signifies that the current state is an accepted end state of a Huffman encoding sequence, and `NGHTTP2_HUFF_SYM`, which indicates that the current state emits a symbol. These flags are used to manage the state transitions and symbol emissions during the Huffman decoding process in HTTP/2 header compression.


---
### nghttp2\_huff\_decode
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `fstate`: The current Huffman decoding state, represented as a node ID of the internal Huffman tree with nghttp2_huff_decode_flag OR-ed.
    - `sym`: The symbol emitted if the NGHTTP2_HUFF_SYM flag is set.
- **Description**: The `nghttp2_huff_decode` structure is used in the nghttp2 library to represent the state of a Huffman decoder. It contains a `fstate` field, which indicates the current state of the decoder in terms of the node ID within the internal Huffman tree, and a `sym` field, which holds the symbol to be emitted if a specific flag is set. This structure is crucial for managing the decoding process of Huffman encoded data, particularly in the context of HTTP/2 header compression.


---
### nghttp2\_hd\_huff\_decode\_context
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `fstate`: The current Huffman decoding state represented as a 16-bit unsigned integer.
- **Description**: The `nghttp2_hd_huff_decode_context` structure is used in the nghttp2 library to maintain the state of Huffman decoding during the processing of HTTP/2 headers. It contains a single member, `fstate`, which holds the current state of the Huffman decoder. This state is crucial for tracking the progress of decoding operations, ensuring that the correct symbols are interpreted from the encoded data stream. The structure is typically initialized and used in conjunction with other decoding functions to handle the Huffman-encoded header data efficiently.


---
### nghttp2\_huff\_sym
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `nbits`: The number of bits in the Huffman code.
    - `code`: The Huffman code aligned to the least significant bit (LSB).
- **Description**: The `nghttp2_huff_sym` structure is used to represent a Huffman symbol in the nghttp2 library, which is an implementation of the HTTP/2 protocol. It contains two members: `nbits`, which specifies the number of bits in the Huffman code, and `code`, which holds the actual Huffman code aligned to the least significant bit. This structure is essential for encoding and decoding operations in the Huffman coding process, which is a key part of HTTP/2 header compression.


---
### nghttp2\_buf
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `last`: A pointer indicating the effective end of the buffer, ensuring last <= end.
- **Description**: The `nghttp2_buf` structure is designed to manage a buffer in memory, specifically for use in the nghttp2 library, which implements the HTTP/2 protocol. It contains a pointer `last` that marks the effective end of the buffer, ensuring that operations do not exceed the allocated memory space. This structure is crucial for handling data efficiently and safely within the library's operations, particularly in contexts where buffer management is critical, such as encoding and decoding processes.


---
### nghttp2\_error
- **Type**: `enum`
- **Members**:
    - `NGHTTP2_ERR_HEADER_COMP`: Represents a header block inflate/deflate error with a value of -523.
- **Description**: The `nghttp2_error` is an enumeration that defines error codes used within the nghttp2 library, specifically for handling errors related to header block compression and decompression. The defined error code, `NGHTTP2_ERR_HEADER_COMP`, indicates an error that occurs during the inflate or deflate process of HTTP/2 header blocks, which is a critical part of the HTTP/2 protocol's efficiency improvements.
