# Purpose
This C source code file provides utility functions for handling HTTP/2 protocol components, specifically focusing on frame types, settings, and error codes. The file defines three functions: [`fd_h2_frame_name`](#fd_h2_frame_name), [`fd_h2_setting_name`](#fd_h2_setting_name), and [`fd_h2_strerror`](#fd_h2_strerror). Each function maps specific identifiers to their corresponding string representations. The [`fd_h2_frame_name`](#fd_h2_frame_name) function translates HTTP/2 frame type identifiers into human-readable names, such as "DATA" or "HEADERS". Similarly, [`fd_h2_setting_name`](#fd_h2_setting_name) converts setting identifiers into descriptive strings like "HEADER_TABLE_SIZE" or "ENABLE_PUSH". The [`fd_h2_strerror`](#fd_h2_strerror) function provides string descriptions for various HTTP/2 error codes, offering explanations such as "protocol error" or "stream closed".

This code is likely part of a larger library or module that deals with HTTP/2 protocol operations, providing a narrow but essential functionality for debugging and logging purposes. By converting numeric identifiers into readable strings, these functions facilitate easier interpretation of protocol operations and errors, which is crucial for developers working with HTTP/2 communications. The file does not define public APIs or external interfaces directly but serves as a supportive component that can be integrated into broader HTTP/2 handling systems.

# Functions

---
### fd\_h2\_frame\_name<!-- {{#callable:fd_h2_frame_name}} -->
The `fd_h2_frame_name` function returns the string representation of an HTTP/2 frame type based on its frame ID.
- **Inputs**:
    - `frame_id`: An unsigned integer representing the ID of the HTTP/2 frame type.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function uses a switch statement to match the input `frame_id` against predefined constants representing different HTTP/2 frame types.
    - For each case in the switch statement, if the `frame_id` matches a known frame type constant, the function returns the corresponding string name of the frame type.
    - If the `frame_id` does not match any known frame type, the function returns the string "unknown".
- **Output**: A constant character pointer to the string name of the HTTP/2 frame type corresponding to the given `frame_id`, or "unknown" if the `frame_id` is not recognized.


---
### fd\_h2\_setting\_name<!-- {{#callable:fd_h2_setting_name}} -->
The `fd_h2_setting_name` function returns a string representation of an HTTP/2 setting name based on a given setting ID.
- **Inputs**:
    - `setting_id`: An unsigned integer representing the ID of the HTTP/2 setting.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function uses a switch statement to match the input `setting_id` against predefined constants representing HTTP/2 settings.
    - If `setting_id` is 0, the function returns the string "reserved".
    - For each predefined setting ID constant (e.g., `FD_H2_SETTINGS_HEADER_TABLE_SIZE`), the function returns a corresponding string name (e.g., "HEADER_TABLE_SIZE").
    - If `setting_id` does not match any predefined constant, the function returns the string "unknown".
- **Output**: A constant character pointer to a string representing the name of the HTTP/2 setting corresponding to the input `setting_id`.


---
### fd\_h2\_strerror<!-- {{#callable:fd_h2_strerror}} -->
The `fd_h2_strerror` function returns a human-readable string describing an HTTP/2 error code.
- **Inputs**:
    - `err`: An unsigned integer representing an HTTP/2 error code.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function uses a switch statement to match the input error code (`err`) against predefined constants representing various HTTP/2 error conditions.
    - For each case in the switch statement, a corresponding string literal describing the error is returned.
    - If the error code does not match any predefined constants, the function returns the string "unknown".
- **Output**: A constant character pointer to a string describing the error associated with the provided error code.
