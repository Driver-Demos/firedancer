# Purpose
This C source code file is a test suite designed to validate the functionality and error handling of an asynchronous I/O (AIO) interface, specifically for packet sending operations. The code includes a series of static assertions to ensure that certain constants and data structures, such as `fd_aio_pkt_info_t`, are correctly defined. The main technical components include a mock function [`test_aio_send_func`](#test_aio_send_func) that simulates the behavior of a packet sending function, and a series of tests that verify the correct handling of various error conditions and the proper functioning of the AIO interface's API.

The file is structured as an executable test program, with a [`main`](#main) function that initializes the test environment, performs a series of tests on the AIO interface, and logs the results. It tests the creation, joining, and deletion of AIO contexts, as well as the correct handling of error codes and the expected behavior of the packet sending function. The code is not intended to be a library or header file for external use but rather a standalone test to ensure the robustness and correctness of the AIO implementation. The use of `FD_TEST` macros and logging functions like `FD_LOG_NOTICE` indicates a focus on automated testing and debugging, providing clear feedback on the success or failure of each test case.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `fd_aio.h`
- `../../util/fd_util.h`


# Global Variables

---
### send\_expected
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Description**: The `send_expected` variable is a static structure that holds information about the expected parameters for a send operation in an asynchronous I/O context. It contains a context pointer (`ctx`), a pointer to a batch of packet information (`batch`), a count of the number of packets in the batch (`batch_cnt`), and an optional pointer to a batch index (`opt_batch_idx`).
- **Use**: This variable is used to store expected values for comparison in the `test_aio_send_func` function to validate the correctness of the send operation.


---
### send\_retval
- **Type**: `int`
- **Description**: The `send_retval` is a static integer variable used to store the return value for the `test_aio_send_func` function. It is used to simulate different return values for testing purposes.
- **Use**: This variable is used to determine the return value of the `test_aio_send_func` function during testing.


# Functions

---
### test\_aio\_send\_func<!-- {{#callable:test_aio_send_func}} -->
The function `test_aio_send_func` verifies that the provided arguments match expected values and returns a predefined return value.
- **Inputs**:
    - `ctx`: A pointer to a context, expected to match `send_expected.ctx`.
    - `batch`: A pointer to a constant `fd_aio_pkt_info_t` structure, expected to match `send_expected.batch`.
    - `batch_cnt`: An unsigned long representing the count of packets in the batch, expected to match `send_expected.batch_cnt`.
    - `opt_batch_idx`: A pointer to an unsigned long, expected to match `send_expected.opt_batch_idx`.
    - `flush`: An integer flag, which is not used in the function body.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function begins by casting the `flush` parameter to void to indicate it is unused.
    - It then performs a series of assertions using `FD_TEST` to check if the input parameters `ctx`, `batch`, `batch_cnt`, and `opt_batch_idx` match the corresponding expected values stored in the `send_expected` structure.
    - Finally, the function returns the value of `send_retval`, which is a predefined static integer.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer value, `send_retval`, which is predefined and static.


---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function initializes the environment, tests various error handling scenarios for asynchronous I/O operations, and performs a simple test to validate the functionality of the AIO interface.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments.
    - `argv`: An array of strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize the environment using `fd_boot` with command-line arguments.
    - Declare an array `_aio` of type `fd_aio_t`.
    - Perform a series of tests to check error handling for various AIO operations, ensuring they return `NULL` when given invalid inputs.
    - Log the error codes and their corresponding string representations using `FD_LOG_NOTICE`.
    - Create a new AIO object with [`fd_aio_new`](fd_aio.c.driver.md#fd_aio_new), join it with [`fd_aio_join`](fd_aio.c.driver.md#fd_aio_join), and verify the context and send function using `FD_TEST`.
    - Set up a batch for sending, configure expected values, and test the send operation with [`fd_aio_send`](fd_aio.h.driver.md#fd_aio_send), expecting an invalid error return value.
    - Leave and delete the AIO object, verifying the operations with `FD_TEST`.
    - Log a success message and halt the program with `fd_halt`.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer value `0`, indicating successful execution.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`fd_aio_new`](fd_aio.c.driver.md#fd_aio_new)
    - [`fd_aio_join`](fd_aio.c.driver.md#fd_aio_join)
