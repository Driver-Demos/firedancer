# Purpose
This C header file defines structures and function prototypes for asynchronous input/output (AIO) operations involving memory caches (mcache) and data caches (dcache) in a system. It introduces two main structures: `fd_aio_tango_tx` for transmitting fragments to an mcache/dcache pair and `fd_aio_tango_rx` for receiving fragments from an mcache. The `fd_aio_tango_tx` structure is designed to handle fragment submission with specific assumptions about cache storage and size, while the `fd_aio_tango_rx` structure is intended for testing purposes, lacking support for fragmentation and backpressure, and is not optimized for high performance. The file provides function prototypes for creating, deleting, and interacting with these structures, facilitating the management of asynchronous data transmission and reception in a cache-based system.

### fd\_aio\_tango\_tx
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `aio`: An instance of fd_aio_t, representing asynchronous I/O operations.
    - `mcache`: A pointer to fd_frag_meta_t, representing the metadata cache for fragments.
    - `dcache`: A pointer to a data cache, used for storing data fragments.
    - `base`: A pointer to the base address for data operations.

    - `sig`: An unsigned long used for signature or identification purposes.
    - `chunk`: An unsigned long representing the current chunk index.
    - `seq`: An unsigned long representing the sequence number for operations.
- **Description**: The `fd_aio_tango_tx` structure is designed to facilitate the submission of data fragments to a paired metadata and data cache (mcache/dcache) using asynchronous I/O operations. It includes fields for managing cache depth, chunk indices, and sequence numbers, as well as parameters for maximum transmission unit size and origin identification. This structure is part of an API that assumes compact storage of the data cache and equal depth for both caches, optimizing for efficient data transmission.

- **Description**: The fd_aio_tango_tx_t structure is designed to facilitate the submission of data fragments to a paired metadata and data cache system using asynchronous I/O operations. It assumes a compact storage format for the data cache and requires that both the metadata and data caches have the same depth. The structure includes various fields for managing the state and configuration of the transmission, such as pointers to the caches, base address, and several unsigned long fields for tracking chunks, sequence numbers, and other operational parameters.

### fd\_aio\_tango\_rx\_t
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `mcache`: A pointer to a constant fd_frag_meta_t structure representing the metadata cache.
    - `depth`: An unsigned long integer representing the depth of the mcache.
    - `base`: A pointer to a base address used for fragment operations.
    - `seq`: An unsigned long integer representing the sequence number for fragment processing.

It includes pointers to the mcache and a base address, as well as a sequence number for tracking fragment processing and a reference to an asynchronous I/O structure.


# Functions

---
### fd\_aio\_tango\_tx\_aio<!-- {{#callable:fd_aio_tango_tx_aio}} -->
The function `fd_aio_tango_tx_aio` returns a constant pointer to the `fd_aio_t` structure within a `fd_aio_tango_tx_t` instance.
- **Inputs**:
    - `self`: A constant pointer to a `fd_aio_tango_tx_t` structure, representing the transmission context from which the `fd_aio_t` is to be retrieved.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function takes a single argument, `self`, which is a pointer to a `fd_aio_tango_tx_t` structure.
    - It accesses the `aio` member of the `fd_aio_tango_tx_t` structure pointed to by `self`.
    - The function returns the address of the `aio` member, effectively providing access to the `fd_aio_t` structure contained within the `fd_aio_tango_tx_t` instance.
- **Output**: A constant pointer to the `fd_aio_t` structure contained within the `fd_aio_tango_tx_t` instance.


# Function Declarations (Public API)

---
### fd\_aio\_tango\_tx\_delete<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_aio_tango_tx_delete}} -->
Deletes a transmit context for asynchronous I/O operations.
- **Description**: Use this function to clean up and delete a previously initialized transmit context represented by `fd_aio_tango_tx_t`. This function should be called when the transmit context is no longer needed, ensuring that any resources associated with it are properly released. It is important to ensure that the `self` parameter is a valid pointer to an initialized `fd_aio_tango_tx_t` structure. After calling this function, the `self` pointer is returned, but the context it points to should not be used unless reinitialized.
- **Inputs**:
    - `self`: A pointer to an `fd_aio_tango_tx_t` structure representing the transmit context to be deleted. Must not be null and should point to a valid, initialized transmit context. The caller retains ownership of the memory.
- **Output**: Returns the `self` pointer, but the context it points to is no longer valid for use.
- **See also**: [`fd_aio_tango_tx_delete`](fd_aio_tango.c.driver.md#fd_aio_tango_tx_delete)  (Implementation)


---
### fd\_aio\_tango\_rx\_delete<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_aio_tango_rx_delete}} -->
Deletes a receive context for asynchronous I/O operations.
- **Description**: Use this function to delete a previously initialized receive context for asynchronous I/O operations. It should be called when the receive context is no longer needed to free up resources. The function does not perform any operations on the context other than returning it, so it is the caller's responsibility to ensure that the context is no longer in use before calling this function. This function is mainly intended for testing purposes and does not support high-performance use cases.
- **Inputs**:
    - `self`: A pointer to the fd_aio_tango_rx_t structure representing the receive context to be deleted. The pointer must not be null, and the context should not be in use when this function is called.
- **Output**: Returns the pointer to the fd_aio_tango_rx_t structure that was passed in.
- **See also**: [`fd_aio_tango_rx_delete`](fd_aio_tango.c.driver.md#fd_aio_tango_rx_delete)  (Implementation)


---
### fd\_aio\_tango\_rx\_poll<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_aio_tango_rx_poll}} -->
Polls for new fragments from the mcache and sends them to the aio receiver.
- **Description**: This function is used to poll for new fragments from the mcache associated with the given receiver context and send them to the aio receiver. It should be called when you want to process incoming fragments. The function does not support fragmentation and does not apply backpressure, meaning fragments may be skipped if the aio receiver is too slow. It is mainly intended for testing purposes and does not support high-performance use cases. The function assumes that the mcache is properly initialized and that the aio receiver is ready to receive data.
- **Inputs**:
    - `self`: A pointer to an fd_aio_tango_rx_t structure representing the receiver context. This must not be null and should be properly initialized before calling this function.
- **Output**: None
- **See also**: [`fd_aio_tango_rx_poll`](fd_aio_tango.c.driver.md#fd_aio_tango_rx_poll)  (Implementation)
