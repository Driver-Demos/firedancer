# Purpose
The provided C header file, `fd_aio.h`, defines an abstraction layer for asynchronous input/output (AIO) operations, specifically focusing on sending and receiving packets. This abstraction is designed to work seamlessly with various low-level I/O libraries and hardware, allowing for performance optimization and code transparency. The file introduces several key components, including data structures and function prototypes, that facilitate the management and transmission of packet data in an asynchronous manner. The `fd_aio_pkt_info_t` structure is used to describe memory regions for packet data, while the `fd_aio_t` structure serves as an opaque handle for AIO instances, encapsulating context and send function pointers. The file also defines error codes and alignment requirements to ensure proper memory management and error handling.

The header file provides a public API for creating, managing, and utilizing AIO instances. It includes function prototypes for aligning and managing the memory footprint of AIO instances, as well as for sending packets ([`fd_aio_send`](#fd_aio_send)) and converting error codes to human-readable strings ([`fd_aio_strerror`](#fd_aio_strerror)). The file is intended to be included in other C source files, providing a consistent interface for asynchronous packet operations. The documentation within the file suggests that the implementation is still under development, with several `FIXME` comments indicating areas for future refinement and customization for specific AIO implementations. Overall, this header file is a foundational component for building systems that require efficient and flexible asynchronous packet processing capabilities.
