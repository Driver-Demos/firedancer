# Purpose
This code is a simple C header file that serves as a guard to prevent multiple inclusions of the same header, which is a common practice in C programming to avoid redefinition errors. The file uses include guards, defined by `#ifndef`, `#define`, and `#endif` preprocessor directives, to ensure that the contents of the file are only included once during compilation. It includes another header file, `fd_util.h`, from a relative path, suggesting that it relies on utility functions or definitions provided by that file. The naming convention and structure imply that this header is part of a larger project, possibly related to a module or component named "waltz" within the project.
