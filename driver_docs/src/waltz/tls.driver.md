- **[fd_tls_asn1.h](tls/fd_tls_asn1.h.driver.md)**: The `fd_tls_asn1.h` file provides minimal APIs for handling ASN.1 DER encoded data, specifically for extracting Ed25519 public keys as per RFC 8410.
- **[fd_tls_estate.h](tls/fd_tls_estate.h.driver.md)**: The `fd_tls_estate.h` file in the `firedancer` codebase defines structures and functions for managing TLS handshake states for both server and client, optimizing memory usage and handling security concerns.
- **[fd_tls_proto.c](tls/fd_tls_proto.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_tls_proto.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase provides functions for encoding and decoding various TLS protocol messages, including client and server hello messages, certificate handling, and extension processing, as part of the TLS handshake process.
- **[fd_tls_proto.h](tls/fd_tls_proto.h.driver.md)**: The `fd_tls_proto.h` file in the `firedancer` codebase declares data structures and internal APIs for encoding and decoding TLS v1.3 messages and extensions, including support for dynamic and static layouts, as well as various TLS-related constants and functions.
- **[fd_tls_serde.h](tls/fd_tls_serde.h.driver.md)**: The `fd_tls_serde.h` file provides branch-minimizing serialization and deserialization macros for internal use within the `fd_tls_proto.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase.
- **[fuzz_tls.c](tls/fuzz_tls.c.driver.md)**: The `fuzz_tls.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase implements a fuzzing test for the `fd_tls` handshaking process, using input data to simulate various TLS handshake states and configurations.
- **[fuzz_tls_msg_parser.c](tls/fuzz_tls_msg_parser.c.driver.md)**: The `fuzz_tls_msg_parser.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase implements a fuzzing test for parsing various TLS message types, including client hello, server hello, encrypted extensions, certificate verification, and finished messages.
- **[Local.mk](tls/Local.mk.driver.md)**: The `Local.mk` file in the `firedancer` codebase defines build and test configurations for the TLS component, including library creation, header and object file management, unit tests, and optional fuzz tests.
- **[test_tls.c](tls/test_tls.c.driver.md)**: The `test_tls.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase contains tests for TLS protocol operations, including encoding and decoding of TLS messages, client-server handshake integration, and handling of incorrect cipher suites.
- **[test_tls_helper.h](tls/test_tls_helper.h.driver.md)**: The `test_tls_helper.h` file in the `firedancer` codebase provides common routines and utilities for unit testing TLS functionalities, including deterministic random number generation, signing operations, and test record transport and logging.
- **[test_tls_openssl.c](tls/test_tls_openssl.c.driver.md)**: The `test_tls_openssl.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase implements tests for the handshake process between an OpenSSL client and an `fd_tls` server, as well as between an `fd_tls` client and an OpenSSL server, using various cryptographic and transport parameters.
