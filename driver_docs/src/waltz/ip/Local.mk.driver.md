# Purpose
The file is a Makefile script used for building and testing components of a software project. It defines rules to add header files and object files, conditionally includes additional object files and unit tests if the `FD_HAS_LINUX` flag is set, and specifies commands to create and run unit tests for `test_fib4_netlink` and `test_fib4`.
