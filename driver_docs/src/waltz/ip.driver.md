## Files
- **[fd_fib4.c](ip/fd_fib4.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_fib4.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase implements a data structure and associated functions for managing IPv4 forwarding information bases (FIBs), including operations for creating, joining, leaving, deleting, clearing, appending routes, and looking up routes.
- **[fd_fib4.h](ip/fd_fib4.h.driver.md)**: The `fd_fib4.h` file defines a data structure and associated functions for managing IPv4 routes in a query-optimized but non-scalable manner, supporting multi-threaded read operations and requiring full rewrites for updates.
- **[fd_fib4_netlink.c](ip/fd_fib4_netlink.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_fib4_netlink.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase provides functionality for interacting with the Linux netlink interface to load and translate IPv4 routing tables into a custom data structure, handling various route types and attributes.
- **[fd_fib4_netlink.h](ip/fd_fib4_netlink.h.driver.md)**: The `fd_fib4_netlink.h` file provides APIs for importing routing tables from Linux netlink into a fib4 object, including error handling and diagnostic logging.
- **[fd_fib4_private.h](ip/fd_fib4_private.h.driver.md)**: The `fd_fib4_private.h` file defines private structures and functions for handling FIB (Forwarding Information Base) entries in the `firedancer` codebase, including key and hop table management.
- **[fd_netlink1.c](ip/fd_netlink1.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_netlink1.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase provides functions for creating, managing, and iterating over netlink sockets, including handling netlink messages and translating route and attribute types to strings.
- **[fd_netlink1.h](ip/fd_netlink1.h.driver.md)**: The `fd_netlink1.h` file in the `firedancer` codebase provides structures and functions for managing netlink sockets and iterating over netlink messages on Linux systems.
- **[Local.mk](ip/Local.mk.driver.md)**: The `Local.mk` file in the `firedancer` codebase specifies the inclusion of headers, object files, and unit tests for the `fd_fib4` and `fd_fib4_netlink` components, with conditional logic for Linux environments.
- **[test_fib4.c](ip/test_fib4.c.driver.md)**: The `test_fib4.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase contains tests for the `fd_fib4` module, which includes setting up and verifying IPv4 forwarding information bases (FIBs) and testing route lookups.
- **[test_fib4_netlink.c](ip/test_fib4_netlink.c.driver.md)**: The `test_fib4_netlink.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase tests the functionality of dumping local and main routing tables using the `fd_fib4_netlink` interface and outputs the results to standard error.
