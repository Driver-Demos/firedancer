# Purpose
This C source code file is designed to facilitate the integration of gRPC with HTTP/2 by providing functions to generate and parse HTTP/2 headers specifically for gRPC requests and responses. The file includes functions such as [`fd_grpc_h2_gen_request_hdrs`](#fd_grpc_h2_gen_request_hdrs), which constructs HTTP/2 headers for a gRPC request, ensuring that necessary headers like method, scheme, path, authority, and content type are correctly set. It also handles optional headers like user-agent and bearer authentication. The function [`fd_grpc_h2_read_response_hdrs`](#fd_grpc_h2_read_response_hdrs) is responsible for parsing HTTP/2 response headers, extracting relevant information such as HTTP status, content type, and gRPC-specific status and message, which are crucial for interpreting the response correctly.

The file also includes utility functions like [`fd_grpc_h2_parse_num`](#fd_grpc_h2_parse_num) for parsing numeric values from headers and [`fd_grpc_status_cstr`](#fd_grpc_status_cstr) for converting gRPC status codes to human-readable strings. The code relies on the HPACK compression format for HTTP/2 header encoding and decoding, as indicated by the inclusion of `fd_hpack.h` and `fd_hpack_wr.h`. This file is part of a larger library or application that deals with gRPC over HTTP/2, providing a focused set of functionalities for handling the header aspects of gRPC communication. It does not define a public API but rather serves as an internal component to be used by other parts of the system that require gRPC and HTTP/2 header management.

# Functions

---
### fd\_hpack\_wr\_content\_type\_grpc<!-- {{#callable:fd_hpack_wr_content_type_grpc}} -->
The function `fd_hpack_wr_content_type_grpc` writes the gRPC content type header to a buffer if there is enough space available.
- **Inputs**:
    - `rbuf_tx`: A pointer to an `fd_h2_rbuf_t` structure representing the buffer where the content type header will be written.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Define a static character array `code` containing the gRPC content type header value prefixed with its length in HPACK format.
    - Check if the free size in the buffer `rbuf_tx` is less than the size of `code` minus one; if true, return 0 indicating failure.
    - If there is enough space, push the `code` into the buffer `rbuf_tx` using `fd_h2_rbuf_push`.
    - Return 1 indicating success.
- **Output**: Returns an integer: 1 if the content type header was successfully written to the buffer, or 0 if there was not enough space.


---
### fd\_grpc\_h2\_gen\_request\_hdrs<!-- {{#callable:fd_grpc_h2_gen_request_hdrs}} -->
The function `fd_grpc_h2_gen_request_hdrs` generates HTTP/2 request headers for a gRPC request and writes them to a buffer.
- **Inputs**:
    - `req`: A pointer to a `fd_grpc_req_hdrs_t` structure containing the request headers such as path, host, and optional bearer authentication.
    - `rbuf_tx`: A pointer to a `fd_h2_rbuf_t` buffer where the generated headers will be written.
    - `version`: A string representing the version of the gRPC client.
    - `version_len`: The length of the version string.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if writing the HTTP method 'POST' to the buffer fails, return 0 if it does.
    - Check if writing the scheme to the buffer fails, return 0 if it does.
    - Check if writing the path from the request headers to the buffer fails, return 0 if it does.
    - Check if writing the authority (host and port) from the request headers to the buffer fails, return 0 if it does.
    - Check if writing the trailers to the buffer fails, return 0 if it does.
    - Check if writing the content type 'application/grpc+proto' to the buffer fails, return 0 if it does.
    - Calculate the length of the user agent string by adding the version length to the base user agent string length.
    - Check if writing the user agent to the buffer fails, return 0 if it does.
    - Push the user agent string and version to the buffer.
    - If bearer authentication is present in the request headers, check if writing it to the buffer fails, return 0 if it does.
    - Return 1 to indicate success.
- **Output**: Returns 1 on success, or 0 if any of the header writing operations fail.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`fd_hpack_wr_content_type_grpc`](#fd_hpack_wr_content_type_grpc)


---
### fd\_grpc\_h2\_parse\_num<!-- {{#callable:fd_grpc_h2_parse_num}} -->
The function `fd_grpc_h2_parse_num` parses a string representing a decimal number and converts it to an unsigned integer.
- **Inputs**:
    - `num`: A pointer to a character array (string) representing the number to be parsed.
    - `num_len`: The length of the string `num`.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function limits `num_len` to a maximum of 10 using `fd_ulong_min` to ensure the string is not too long.
    - A character array `num_cstr` of size 11 is initialized to store the number string.
    - The function initializes `num_cstr` and appends the text from `num` up to `num_len` characters.
    - The appended string is finalized using `fd_cstr_fini`.
    - The finalized string is converted to an unsigned integer using `fd_cstr_to_uint` and returned.
- **Output**: The function returns an unsigned integer representation of the parsed number string.

### fd\_grpc\_h2\_read\_response\_hdrs<!-- {{#callable:fd_grpc_h2_read_response_hdrs}} -->
The function `fd_grpc_h2_read_response_hdrs` parses HTTP/2 response headers from a payload and populates a response headers structure with relevant gRPC information.
- **Inputs**:
    - `resp`: A pointer to an `fd_grpc_resp_hdrs_t` structure where parsed response headers will be stored.
    - `matcher`: A constant pointer to an `fd_h2_hdr_matcher_t` used to match header names against known header types.
    - `payload`: A constant pointer to an unsigned character array containing the raw payload data to be parsed.
    - `payload_sz`: An unsigned long representing the size of the payload data.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize an HPACK reader with the given payload and its size.
    - Enter a loop that continues until all headers are read from the payload.
    - Within the loop, allocate a scratch buffer and read the next header using the HPACK reader.
    - If an error occurs during header reading, log a warning and return a protocol error code.
    - Match the header name against known header types using the matcher.
    - Depending on the matched header type, update the corresponding fields in the response structure (e.g., HTTP/2 status, gRPC status, content type, and gRPC message).
- **Output**: Returns `FD_H2_SUCCESS` on successful parsing of all headers, or `FD_H2_ERR_PROTOCOL` if a parsing error occurs.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`fd_grpc_h2_parse_num`](#fd_grpc_h2_parse_num)

### fd\_grpc\_status\_cstr<!-- {{#callable:fd_grpc_status_cstr}} -->
The `fd_grpc_status_cstr` function returns a string representation of a gRPC status code.
- **Inputs**:
    - `status`: An unsigned integer representing a gRPC status code.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function uses a switch statement to match the input `status` with predefined gRPC status codes.
    - For each case, it returns a corresponding string literal that describes the status code.
    - If the `status` does not match any predefined case, it defaults to returning "unknown".
- **Output**: A constant character pointer to a string that describes the gRPC status code.
