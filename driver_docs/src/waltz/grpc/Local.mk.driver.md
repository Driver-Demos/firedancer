# Purpose
The file is a Makefile script used to automate the build process for a software project. It defines rules to add header files and object files for components such as `fd_grpc_codec` and `fd_grpc_client`, specifies the creation of a unit test for `test_grpc_codec`, and includes a command to execute this unit test.
