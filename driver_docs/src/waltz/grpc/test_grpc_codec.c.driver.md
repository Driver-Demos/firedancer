# Purpose
This C source code file is designed to test the functionality of generating HTTP/2 request headers for gRPC communication. It includes the necessary headers for handling HTTP/2 buffers and HPACK encoding, which are essential for constructing and parsing HTTP/2 headers. The primary function, [`test_h2_gen_request_hdr`](#test_h2_gen_request_hdr), creates and verifies HTTP/2 request headers using the `fd_grpc_h2_gen_request_hdrs` function. It sets up request headers with specific attributes such as host, path, and authorization, and then checks if the headers are correctly encoded and decoded using HPACK, a compression format for HTTP/2 headers.

The code is structured as a test suite, with the [`main`](#main) function initializing the environment, executing the test function, and logging the results. The test function uses macros and assertions to ensure that the generated headers match expected values, including standard HTTP/2 headers like `:method`, `:scheme`, and `:authority`, as well as custom headers like `authorization`. This file is not intended to be a reusable library or a public API but rather a standalone executable for validating the correctness of the gRPC HTTP/2 header generation process.

# Functions

---
### test\_h2\_gen\_request\_hdr<!-- {{#callable:test_h2_gen_request_hdr}} -->
The function `test_h2_gen_request_hdr` tests the generation and validation of HTTP/2 request headers for gRPC requests using predefined header values and a buffer.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize a `fd_grpc_req_hdrs_t` structure `req` with specific HTTP/2 request header values for a gRPC request.
    - Declare a buffer `buf` and initialize a `fd_h2_rbuf_t` structure `rbuf_tx` with this buffer.
    - Call [`fd_grpc_h2_gen_request_hdrs`](fd_grpc_codec.c.driver.md#fd_grpc_h2_gen_request_hdrs) to generate HTTP/2 headers into `rbuf_tx` and verify the operation's success with `FD_TEST`.
    - Define a macro `EXPECT_HDR` to validate expected header names and values using `fd_hpack_rd_t` and `fd_h2_hdr_t` structures.
    - Initialize `fd_hpack_rd_t` structure `hpack_rd` with the buffer and validate the generated headers using `EXPECT_HDR`.
    - Repeat the process with a second `fd_grpc_req_hdrs_t` structure `req2` that includes a bearer authentication token, and validate the headers including the 'authorization' header.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it uses assertions to validate the correctness of header generation and outputs test results.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`fd_grpc_h2_gen_request_hdrs`](fd_grpc_codec.c.driver.md#fd_grpc_h2_gen_request_hdrs)


---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function initializes the environment, runs a test for generating HTTP/2 request headers, logs a success message, and then halts the program.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The count of command-line arguments passed to the program.
    - `argv`: An array of strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Call `fd_boot` to initialize the environment with command-line arguments.
    - Invoke [`test_h2_gen_request_hdr`](#test_h2_gen_request_hdr) to perform tests on HTTP/2 request header generation.
    - Log a notice message indicating the test passed using `FD_LOG_NOTICE`.
    - Call `fd_halt` to cleanly shut down the program.
    - Return 0 to indicate successful execution.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer value of 0, indicating successful execution.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`test_h2_gen_request_hdr`](#test_h2_gen_request_hdr)
