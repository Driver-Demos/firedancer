# Purpose
This code is a C header file designed to provide an interface for working with network devices on Linux systems using netlink, a communication protocol between the Linux kernel and user-space processes. The file includes necessary headers for network device table management and netlink operations, specifically `fd_netdev_tbl.h` and `fd_netlink1.h`. It defines a function prototype, [`fd_netdev_netlink_load_table`](#fd_netdev_netlink_load_table), which is intended to load network interface data into a provided table structure using netlink. The use of preprocessor directives ensures that the code is only compiled on Linux systems, highlighting its platform-specific functionality. Overall, this header file is part of a larger system for managing network interfaces in a Linux environment.
# Imports and Dependencies

# Function Declarations (Public API)

### fd\_netdev\_netlink\_load\_table<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_netdev_netlink_load_table}} -->
Loads network interface data into a table using netlink.
- **Description**: This function populates a network device table with interface data obtained from the Linux netlink interface. It should be called when you need to refresh or initialize the network device table with the current state of network interfaces. The function resets the table before loading new data, ensuring that it reflects the latest interface configurations. It handles various interface attributes such as name, MAC address, operational status, MTU, and master-slave relationships for bonded interfaces. The function returns an error code if it encounters issues during the netlink communication or data processing.
- **Inputs**:
    - `tbl`: A pointer to an fd_netdev_tbl_join_t structure where the network interface data will be loaded. The table is reset before loading new data. Must not be null.
    - `netlink`: A pointer to an fd_netlink_t structure used for netlink communication. Must be properly initialized and not null.
- **Output**: Returns 0 on success or a non-zero error code if an error occurs during the operation.
