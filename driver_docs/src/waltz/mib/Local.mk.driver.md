# Purpose
This file is a Makefile snippet used to manage the build process of a software project. It defines rules for adding header files and object files to the build system, and conditionally includes additional files and unit tests if the `FD_HAS_LINUX` flag is set, indicating compatibility with Linux systems. The use of `$(call ...)` suggests the use of macros or functions to streamline the inclusion of these components.
