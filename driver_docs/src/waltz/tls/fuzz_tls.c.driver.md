# Purpose
This C source code file is designed to perform fuzz testing on the TLS (Transport Layer Security) handshake process, specifically targeting the `fd_tls` library. The file includes several static functions that simulate various aspects of a TLS handshake, such as handling secrets, sending messages, and managing QUIC transport parameters. These functions are used to create a template for a TLS context (`tls_tmpl`), which is then utilized in the fuzzing process. The file also defines valid handshake states for both server and client contexts, ensuring that the fuzzing process adheres to realistic state transitions.

The main functionality is encapsulated in the [`LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`](#LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput) function, which is a standard entry point for fuzz testing with LLVM's libFuzzer. This function initializes a random number generator, parses the input to reconstruct a fake state, and then simulates a TLS handshake using either server or client logic based on the input state. The file also includes an initialization function, [`LLVMFuzzerInitialize`](#LLVMFuzzerInitialize), which sets up the environment for fuzz testing, including configuring logging and generating cryptographic keys. The code is structured to be part of a larger testing framework, leveraging external libraries for cryptographic operations and mock certificate generation, and is intended to be compiled and executed in a hosted environment where `FD_HAS_HOSTED` is defined.

# Global Variables

---
### tls\_tmpl
- **Type**: `fd_tls_t[1]`
- **Description**: The `tls_tmpl` is a static array of one `fd_tls_t` structure, initialized with function pointers and ALPN (Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation) settings. It serves as a template for TLS (Transport Layer Security) configurations, providing default function implementations for handling secrets, sending messages, and managing QUIC transport parameters.
- **Use**: This variable is used as a template to initialize and configure TLS connections with predefined settings and function callbacks.


---
### \_tls\_valid\_srv\_hs\_state
- **Type**: `uchar[16]`
- **Description**: The `_tls_valid_srv_hs_state` is a static array of unsigned characters with a size of 16 elements. It is used to represent valid server handshake states in a TLS (Transport Layer Security) protocol implementation. Each index in the array corresponds to a specific handshake state, and the value of 1 indicates that the state is valid for server operations.
- **Use**: This variable is used to check if a given server handshake state is valid during the TLS handshake process.


---
### \_tls\_valid\_cli\_hs\_state
- **Type**: `uchar[16]`
- **Description**: The `_tls_valid_cli_hs_state` is a static array of unsigned characters with a size of 16, used to represent valid client handshake states in a TLS (Transport Layer Security) protocol implementation. Each index in the array corresponds to a specific handshake state, and the value of 1 indicates that the state is valid for a client during the TLS handshake process.
- **Use**: This variable is used to validate the current handshake state of a client in the TLS protocol, ensuring that only valid states are processed during the handshake.


# Functions

---
### \_tls\_secrets<!-- {{#callable:_tls_secrets}} -->
The `_tls_secrets` function is a placeholder function that takes four parameters related to TLS secrets and encryption level but does not perform any operations with them.
- **Inputs**:
    - `handshake`: A constant pointer to a handshake object, presumably related to the TLS handshake process.
    - `recv_secret`: A constant pointer to the receive secret, likely used for decrypting incoming data.
    - `send_secret`: A constant pointer to the send secret, likely used for encrypting outgoing data.
    - `encryption_level`: An unsigned integer representing the encryption level, which might indicate the stage or strength of encryption in the TLS process.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function takes four parameters but does not use them, as indicated by the casting of each parameter to void.
    - There are no conditional statements, loops, or any other control structures within the function body.
- **Output**: The function does not return any value or produce any output.


---
### \_tls\_sendmsg<!-- {{#callable:_tls_sendmsg}} -->
The `_tls_sendmsg` function is a stub that takes several parameters related to TLS message sending but currently does nothing with them and always returns 1.
- **Inputs**:
    - `handshake`: A pointer to the handshake data, which is not used in the function.
    - `record`: A pointer to the record data, which is not used in the function.

---
### \_tls\_quic\_tp\_self<!-- {{#callable:_tls_quic_tp_self}} -->
The function `_tls_quic_tp_self` copies a predefined transport parameter buffer to a provided buffer and returns the size of the copied data.
- **Inputs**:
    - `handshake`: A pointer to a handshake object, which is not used in this function.
    - `quic_tp`: A pointer to a buffer where the transport parameters will be copied.
    - `quic_tp_bufsz`: The size of the buffer pointed to by `quic_tp`, which must be at least the size of the transport parameter buffer.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function begins by casting the `handshake` parameter to void to indicate it is unused.
    - A static constant buffer `tp_buf` is defined with specific transport parameter values.
    - An assertion checks that `quic_tp_bufsz` is at least the size of `tp_buf` to ensure there is enough space to copy the data.
    - The function uses `fd_memcpy` to copy the contents of `tp_buf` into the buffer pointed to by `quic_tp`.
    - The function returns the size of `tp_buf`, indicating the number of bytes copied.
- **Output**: The function returns the size of the transport parameter buffer, which is a constant value.
