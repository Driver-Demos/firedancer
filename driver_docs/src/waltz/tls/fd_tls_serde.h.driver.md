# Purpose
The provided code is a C header file, `fd_tls_serde.h`, which defines a set of macros for serialization and deserialization operations, specifically tailored for use within the `fd_tls_proto.c` file. This header is not intended for general use and should not be included in other parts of the codebase. The primary purpose of these macros is to facilitate efficient and safe encoding and decoding of data structures, with a focus on minimizing branching and ensuring bounds checking during these operations.

The macros defined in this file, such as `FD_TLS_SERDE_BEGIN`, `FD_TLS_SERDE_END`, `FD_TLS_SERDE_LOCATE`, and others, create a structured context for handling data serialization and deserialization. They ensure that operations are performed within a controlled scope, using a `do/while(0)` construct to encapsulate the logic. The macros handle tasks like locating fields within a data stream, performing bounds checks, and executing memory copy operations with byte-swapping for endianness correction. Additionally, convenience macros like `FD_TLS_DECODE_FIELD` and `FD_TLS_ENCODE_FIELD` simplify the process of handling individual fields, while batch operations are supported through macros like `FD_TLS_DECODE_STATIC_BATCH`. The file also includes mechanisms for handling lists and skipping fields, providing a comprehensive toolkit for managing serialized data in a controlled and efficient manner.
