# Purpose
The provided content is a Makefile, which is used to automate the build process of a software project. This particular Makefile snippet is responsible for managing the compilation and testing of a library and its associated components related to TLS (Transport Layer Security). It defines targets for creating the `fd_tls` library and specifies the header files (`fd_tls.h`, `fd_tls_proto.h`, etc.) and object files needed for the build. Additionally, it sets up unit tests and fuzz tests for the TLS components, with conditional logic to include tests that depend on specific features like hosted environments or OpenSSL support. The commented section suggests an optional test configuration for integration with quictls, indicating that upstream OpenSSL does not support this test.
