# Purpose
The file is a Makefile snippet used for build automation. It defines targets and dependencies for a project, specifically adding header files (`fd_quic_log.h`, `fd_quic_log_user.h`) and object files (`fd_quic_log`, `fd_quic`) to the build process. The commented line suggests a unit test target (`test_quic_log`) that depends on `fd_quic` and `fd_util` components, but it is currently not active.
