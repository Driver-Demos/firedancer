# Purpose
The provided C source code file implements functionality for managing and generating QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections) streams, specifically for the purpose of generating and sending spam data over these streams. The code defines several functions that handle the lifecycle of a `fd_quic_stream_spam_t` object, which appears to be a structure used to manage the state and context for generating spam data on QUIC streams. The key functions include [`fd_quic_stream_spam_new`](#fd_quic_stream_spam_new), which initializes a new spam stream object, [`fd_quic_stream_spam_join`](#fd_quic_stream_spam_join) and [`fd_quic_stream_spam_leave`](#fd_quic_stream_spam_leave), which manage the association and disassociation of the spam stream object, and [`fd_quic_stream_spam_delete`](#fd_quic_stream_spam_delete), which handles the cleanup of the spam stream object.

The core functionality is encapsulated in the [`fd_quic_stream_spam_service`](#fd_quic_stream_spam_service) function, which is responsible for generating and sending data over a QUIC stream. It uses a callback function, `gen_fn`, to generate the payload data, which is then sent over the stream. The [`fd_quic_stream_spam_gen`](#fd_quic_stream_spam_gen) function is a utility that generates random data to be used as the payload, simulating spam. The code also includes a notification function, [`fd_quic_stream_spam_notify`](#fd_quic_stream_spam_notify), which handles stream deallocation events. Overall, this file provides a specialized implementation for generating and managing spam data transmission over QUIC streams, likely intended for testing or stress-testing QUIC connections.

# Functions

---
### fd\_quic\_stream\_spam\_new<!-- {{#callable:fd_quic_stream_spam_new}} -->
The `fd_quic_stream_spam_new` function initializes a `fd_quic_stream_spam_t` structure in a given memory location, setting its generator function and context.
- **Inputs**:
    - `mem`: A pointer to the memory location where the `fd_quic_stream_spam_t` structure will be initialized.
    - `gen_fn`: A function pointer of type `fd_quic_stream_gen_spam_t` that will be used to generate stream payloads.
    - `gen_ctx`: A pointer to the context that will be passed to the generator function `gen_fn`.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if the `mem` pointer is NULL; if so, log a warning and return NULL.
    - Check if the `mem` pointer is properly aligned for `fd_quic_stream_spam_t`; if not, log a warning and return NULL.
    - Cast the `mem` pointer to a `fd_quic_stream_spam_t` pointer and zero out the memory using `memset`.
    - Assign the `gen_fn` and `gen_ctx` to the corresponding fields in the `fd_quic_stream_spam_t` structure.
    - Return the initialized `fd_quic_stream_spam_t` pointer cast to a `void *`.
- **Output**: A pointer to the initialized `fd_quic_stream_spam_t` structure, or NULL if the input memory is invalid.


---
### fd\_quic\_stream\_spam\_join<!-- {{#callable:fd_quic_stream_spam_join}} -->
The `fd_quic_stream_spam_join` function validates and returns a pointer to a `fd_quic_stream_spam_t` structure if the input pointer is non-null and properly aligned.
- **Inputs**:
    - `shspam`: A void pointer to a memory location that is expected to point to a `fd_quic_stream_spam_t` structure.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if `shspam` is NULL; if so, log a warning and return NULL.
    - Check if `shspam` is aligned to the alignment requirements of `fd_quic_stream_spam_t`; if not, log a warning and return NULL.
    - If both checks pass, cast `shspam` to a `fd_quic_stream_spam_t` pointer and return it.
- **Output**: A pointer to `fd_quic_stream_spam_t` if the input is valid, otherwise NULL.


---
### fd\_quic\_stream\_spam\_leave<!-- {{#callable:fd_quic_stream_spam_leave}} -->
The `fd_quic_stream_spam_leave` function returns the input `fd_quic_stream_spam_t` pointer as a `void` pointer.
- **Inputs**:
    - `spam`: A pointer to an `fd_quic_stream_spam_t` structure, which represents a QUIC stream spam object.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function takes a single argument, `spam`, which is a pointer to an `fd_quic_stream_spam_t` structure.
    - It directly returns the input `spam` pointer cast to a `void` pointer.
- **Output**: The function returns the input `fd_quic_stream_spam_t` pointer cast to a `void` pointer.


---
### fd\_quic\_stream\_spam\_delete<!-- {{#callable:fd_quic_stream_spam_delete}} -->
The `fd_quic_stream_spam_delete` function returns the input pointer without modification.
- **Inputs**:
    - `shspam`: A pointer to a shared spam object, which is expected to be of type `void *`.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function takes a single input parameter `shspam`.
    - It directly returns the `shspam` pointer without performing any operations on it.
- **Output**: The function returns the same pointer that was passed to it as input, effectively performing no operation.


---
### fd\_quic\_stream\_spam\_service<!-- {{#callable:fd_quic_stream_spam_service}} -->
The `fd_quic_stream_spam_service` function attempts to send a payload over a QUIC stream, creating a new stream if necessary, and returns the number of streams successfully sent.
- **Inputs**:
    - `conn`: A pointer to an `fd_quic_conn_t` structure representing the QUIC connection.
    - `spam`: A pointer to an `fd_quic_stream_spam_t` structure containing the stream and a function to generate the payload.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize `streams_sent` to 0.
    - Enter an infinite loop to attempt sending data over a stream.
    - Check if `spam->stream` is NULL; if so, create a new stream using `fd_quic_conn_new_stream`.
    - If no stream is available, break the loop.
    - Retrieve the stream ID and set `spam->stream` to NULL.
    - Generate a payload using `spam->gen_fn` and store it in `payload_buf`.
    - Attempt to send the payload using `fd_quic_stream_send`.
    - If the send is successful, increment `streams_sent`, log the success, and break the loop.
    - If the send fails with an error other than `FD_QUIC_SEND_ERR_FLOW`, log a warning and set `streams_sent` to -1.
    - If the send fails with `FD_QUIC_SEND_ERR_FLOW`, store the stream back in `spam->stream` and exit the loop.
    - Return the value of `streams_sent`.
- **Output**: Returns a long integer indicating the number of streams successfully sent, or -1 if an error occurred.


---
### fd\_quic\_stream\_spam\_notify<!-- {{#callable:fd_quic_stream_spam_notify}} -->
The `fd_quic_stream_spam_notify` function marks a stream as a 'tombstone' in the pending stack to indicate it should be skipped during stack unwinding.
- **Inputs**:
    - `stream`: A pointer to the `fd_quic_stream_t` structure representing the stream to be notified.
    - `stream_ctx`: A pointer to the context associated with the stream, which is used to identify its position in the pending stack.
    - `notify_type`: An integer representing the type of notification, though it is not used in the function.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function begins by casting the `stream` and `notify_type` parameters to void to indicate they are unused.
    - It checks if `stream_ctx` is NULL using `FD_LIKELY`; if true, the function returns immediately as there is nothing to do for completed streams.
    - If `stream_ctx` is not NULL, it casts `stream_ctx` to a double pointer to `fd_quic_stream_t` and sets the dereferenced value to NULL, marking it as a 'tombstone'.
- **Output**: The function does not return any value.


---
### fd\_quic\_stream\_spam\_gen<!-- {{#callable:fd_quic_stream_spam_gen}} -->
The `fd_quic_stream_spam_gen` function generates a random payload of bytes to be sent over a QUIC stream.
- **Inputs**:
    - `ctx`: A context pointer, which is not used in this function.
    - `pkt`: A pointer to an `fd_aio_pkt_info_t` structure that contains a buffer and its size, which will be filled with random data.
    - `stream_id`: An unsigned long integer representing the ID of the QUIC stream for which the random data is being generated.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function begins by ignoring the `ctx` parameter as it is not used.
    - A random number generator (`fd_rng_t`) is initialized using the `stream_id` as a seed.
    - The size of the data to be generated is determined by rolling a random number up to the maximum buffer size (`pkt->buf_sz`).
    - The buffer size in `pkt` is updated to the randomly determined size.
    - A loop iterates over the buffer, filling it with random 8-byte chunks until the buffer is filled to the aligned size.
    - The random number generator is cleaned up and deleted at the end of the function.
- **Output**: The function outputs a buffer (`pkt->buf`) filled with random bytes, and updates the buffer size (`pkt->buf_sz`) to reflect the size of the generated data.
