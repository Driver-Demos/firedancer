# Purpose
The provided C code is a test program designed to evaluate the performance and concurrency handling capabilities of a QUIC server implementation, specifically the `fd_quic` server. The test simulates a high number of concurrent connections, each sending small streams, to approximate the conditions of a QUIC server operating on a mainnet, such as a blockchain network. The test bypasses certain real-world complexities, such as decryption, by injecting traffic directly at the QUIC frame level using a sandbox environment. This allows the server to focus on processing and sending encrypted packets, thereby testing its ability to handle a large volume of connections efficiently.

The code is structured to initialize a QUIC server instance with specified limits on connections and other parameters, using a sandbox to simulate traffic. It allocates resources for the server and connections, sets up a test loop to inject traffic, and measures the server's performance in terms of frame and packet handling. The test concludes by validating the server's state and ensuring that it does not send an excessive number of acknowledgments, which would indicate inefficiencies. This program is a standalone executable, as indicated by the presence of a [`main`](#main) function, and it does not define public APIs or external interfaces. Instead, it serves as a performance and stress test tool for developers working on the `fd_quic` server implementation.

# Functions

---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function initializes and tests a QUIC server's ability to handle a large number of connections by simulating traffic and measuring performance metrics.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments passed to the program.
    - `argv`: An array of strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize the environment and random number generator.
    - Determine the CPU index and adjust if it exceeds the shared memory CPU count.
    - Parse command-line arguments for page size, page count, NUMA index, connection count, test duration, and connection burst size.
    - Convert the page size string to a numeric value and log an error if unsupported.
    - Create a workspace with the specified page size and count for predictable performance.
    - Set up QUIC limits and log the configuration details.
    - Allocate memory for the QUIC sandbox and initialize it as a server.
    - Create a list of server-side connection objects for traffic injection.
    - Enter a test loop where traffic is injected into the server and performance metrics are logged.
    - Periodically log statistics about the frame rate and check if the test duration has elapsed.
    - Send frames to the server and ensure connections remain active.
    - After the test loop, log the total number of frames and packets sent.
    - Validate the QUIC service and clean up allocated resources.
    - Log a success message and halt the program.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer, specifically 0, indicating successful execution.
