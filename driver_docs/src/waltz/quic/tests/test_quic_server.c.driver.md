# Purpose
This C source code file is an executable program designed to set up and run a QUIC server using the functionalities provided by the `fd_quic` library. The program initializes necessary resources, such as random number generators and shared memory workspaces, and configures the QUIC server with parameters that can be specified via command-line arguments. It creates a QUIC server instance, sets up UDP socket communication, and configures transport parameters for the QUIC protocol, such as maximum data limits and stream configurations. The server is then run in a loop, continuously servicing QUIC and UDP socket operations, demonstrating a typical server lifecycle from initialization to shutdown.

The code is structured to handle various configurations and setups, including the use of packet capture (pcap) for network traffic analysis if specified. It leverages helper functions and structures from the `fd_quic` and `fd_quic_test_helpers` libraries to streamline the setup and execution of the server. The program is designed to be robust, with error checking and logging throughout to ensure proper operation and to facilitate debugging. This file is a comprehensive example of setting up a QUIC server, showcasing the integration of network communication, memory management, and server configuration in a C-based environment.

### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function initializes and runs a QUIC server, setting up necessary resources and configurations, and enters an infinite loop to service QUIC and UDP socket operations.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: An integer representing the number of command-line arguments.
    - `argv`: An array of strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize the environment and QUIC test environment using `fd_boot` and [`fd_quic_test_boot`](fd_quic_test_helpers.c.driver.md#fd_quic_test_boot).
    - Create a random number generator `rng` using `fd_rng_new` and `fd_rng_join`.
    - Determine the CPU index and adjust if it exceeds the shared memory CPU count.
    - Parse command-line arguments for page size, page count, and NUMA index using `fd_env_strip_cmdline_cstr` and `fd_env_strip_cmdline_ulong`.
    - Convert the page size string to an actual size using `fd_cstr_to_shmem_page_sz` and log an error if unsupported.
    - Initialize QUIC limits from the environment using `fd_quic_limits_from_env`.
    - Create an anonymous workspace with the specified page size and count using `fd_wksp_new_anonymous`.
    - Create a QUIC server instance using [`fd_quic_new_anonymous`](fd_quic_test_helpers.c.driver.md#fd_quic_new_anonymous) and verify its creation.
    - Retrieve the AIO network receive interface from the QUIC instance and optionally set up packet capture if `fd_quic_test_pcap` is enabled.
    - Create a UDP socket for QUIC using [`fd_quic_udpsock_create`](fd_quic_test_helpers.c.driver.md#fd_quic_udpsock_create) and verify its creation.
    - Configure QUIC transport parameters and initialize the QUIC configuration from the environment.
    - Retrieve the AIO network transmit interface from the UDP socket and optionally set up packet capture.
    - Set the AIO network transmit interface for the QUIC instance using `fd_quic_set_aio_net_tx`.
    - Initialize the QUIC instance using `fd_quic_init`.
    - Enter an infinite loop to service QUIC and UDP socket operations using `fd_quic_service` and [`fd_quic_udpsock_service`](fd_quic_test_helpers.c.driver.md#fd_quic_udpsock_service).
    - Finalize the QUIC instance using `fd_quic_fini` and clean up resources including the workspace, UDP socket, and random number generator.
    - Log a 'pass' message and halt the QUIC test and program execution.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer value of 0, indicating successful execution.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`fd_quic_test_boot`](fd_quic_test_helpers.c.driver.md#fd_quic_test_boot)
    - [`fd_quic_new_anonymous`](fd_quic_test_helpers.c.driver.md#fd_quic_new_anonymous)
