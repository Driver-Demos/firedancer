# Purpose
This C source code file is designed to test and benchmark the cryptographic operations associated with the QUIC protocol, specifically focusing on the encryption and decryption of packets as outlined in RFC 9001. The file includes functions to verify the correctness of cryptographic key derivation and packet protection processes, using predefined test vectors and expected outputs. It imports binary data representing test payloads and uses these to validate the encryption and decryption functions provided by the QUIC cryptographic library. The code defines several static arrays containing expected cryptographic secrets and keys, which are used to ensure that the derived keys and secrets match the expected values from the RFC.

The file contains a main function that orchestrates the testing of various cryptographic operations, including the generation of initial secrets, key derivation, and the encryption and decryption of QUIC packets. It also includes helper functions to test specific aspects of the QUIC cryptographic process, such as handling short packet numbers and nonce generation. Additionally, the file performs performance benchmarking of the encryption and decryption processes to evaluate their throughput. The code is structured to provide comprehensive testing of the QUIC cryptographic operations, ensuring compliance with the protocol specifications and verifying the implementation's correctness and efficiency.
