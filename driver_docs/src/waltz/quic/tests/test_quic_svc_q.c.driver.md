# Purpose
This C source code file is designed to test the functionality of a QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections) service queue, specifically focusing on the scheduling and management of connection timers. The code includes several static functions that create mock connections, initialize service timers, and test the scheduling, rescheduling, and cancellation of these timers. The main function orchestrates these tests, ensuring that the service queue behaves as expected under various conditions. The file imports several headers related to QUIC services, indicating that it is part of a larger system dealing with QUIC protocol operations.

The code is structured to provide a comprehensive test suite for the QUIC service queue, with functions like [`test_svc_schedule`](#test_svc_schedule), [`test_svc_cancel`](#test_svc_cancel), and [`test_multiple_connections`](#test_multiple_connections) verifying different aspects of the timer management system. The use of mock connections and the allocation of memory for testing purposes suggest that this file is intended for internal testing rather than being part of a public API or external interface. The tests ensure that connections are scheduled correctly, that rescheduling respects earlier timeouts, and that cancellations are handled properly. The file concludes with a main function that initializes the testing environment, runs the tests, and logs the results, confirming the correct operation of the service queue.

    - `conn_cnt`: An unsigned long integer specifying the number of connections to create.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Calculate the memory footprint required for a single connection using `fd_quic_conn_footprint` with the provided limits.
    - Allocate memory for the specified number of connections using `aligned_alloc`, ensuring proper alignment with `fd_quic_conn_align`.
    - Check if the memory allocation was successful using `FD_TEST`.

    - Return the pointer to the allocated memory block containing the initialized connections.
- **Output**: A pointer to the allocated memory block containing the initialized mock connections.

The `test_svc_timers_init` function initializes and tests the service timers for a specified maximum number of connections, ensuring proper memory allocation and initialization.
- **Inputs**:
    - `max_conn`: The maximum number of connections for which the service timers are to be initialized.
    - `out_to_free`: A pointer to a uchar pointer where the allocated memory address will be stored for later deallocation.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Log a notice indicating the start of the test for `fd_quic_svc_timers_init`.
    - Calculate the memory footprint required for the service timers using `fd_quic_svc_timers_footprint` with `max_conn`.
    - Assert that the calculated footprint is greater than zero using `FD_TEST`.
    - Allocate aligned memory for the service timers using `aligned_alloc` with the calculated footprint and alignment from `fd_quic_svc_timers_align`.
    - Assert that the memory allocation was successful using `FD_TEST`.
    - Store the allocated memory address in `out_to_free` for later deallocation.
    - Initialize the service timers using `fd_quic_svc_timers_init` with the allocated memory and `max_conn`.
    - Assert that the initialization of the service timers was successful using `FD_TEST`.

### test\_svc\_schedule<!-- {{#callable:test_svc_schedule}} -->
The `test_svc_schedule` function tests the scheduling and rescheduling of QUIC service timers for a connection.
- **Inputs**:
    - `timers`: A pointer to an `fd_quic_svc_timers_t` structure, which manages the scheduling of QUIC service events.
    - `conn`: A pointer to an `fd_quic_conn_t` structure, representing a QUIC connection whose service events are being scheduled.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Log the start of the test for `fd_quic_svc_schedule`.
    - Set the current time to 1000 and schedule a connection with a timeout of 1100.
    - Verify that the connection is scheduled by checking its index is not invalid.
    - Reschedule the connection with an earlier timeout of 1050 and verify it is still scheduled.
    - Attempt to reschedule the connection with a later timeout of 1150, which should be ignored.
    - Retrieve the next scheduled event and verify that the timeout is still 1050, confirming the earlier rescheduling was retained.
    - Log the successful completion of the `fd_quic_svc_schedule` test.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it performs tests and logs results to verify the scheduling behavior of QUIC service timers.


---
### test\_svc\_cancel<!-- {{#callable:test_svc_cancel}} -->
The `test_svc_cancel` function tests the cancellation of a scheduled service event for a QUIC connection and verifies the cancellation's correctness.
- **Inputs**:
    - `timers`: A pointer to an `fd_quic_svc_timers_t` structure, which manages the scheduling of service events for QUIC connections.
    - `conn`: A pointer to an `fd_quic_conn_t` structure, representing a QUIC connection whose scheduled service event is to be tested for cancellation.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Log the start of the `fd_quic_svc_cancel` test.
    - Set the current time to 1000 and schedule a service event for the connection with a timeout of 1100.
    - Call `fd_quic_svc_schedule` to schedule the event and verify that the connection's index is valid (not `FD_QUIC_SVC_IDX_INVAL`).
    - Call `fd_quic_svc_cancel` to cancel the scheduled event and verify that the connection's index is now invalid (`FD_QUIC_SVC_IDX_INVAL`).
    - Retrieve the next scheduled event using `fd_quic_svc_timers_next` and verify that the queue is empty (i.e., no connection is scheduled).
    - Log the successful completion of the `fd_quic_svc_cancel` test.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it uses assertions to verify the correctness of the cancellation process.
