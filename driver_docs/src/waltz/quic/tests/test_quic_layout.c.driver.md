# Purpose
This C source code file is a simple script designed to print the sizes of various data structures related to the QUIC protocol, specifically those prefixed with `fd_quic_`. It includes several header and source files that likely define and implement these structures, such as `fd_quic_proto.h`, `fd_quic_proto.c`, and various template files. The main function uses a macro, `FD_TEMPL_DEF_STRUCT_BEGIN`, to iterate over and print the size of each structure defined in the included template files. The script is primarily used for debugging or informational purposes, providing insights into the memory footprint of the QUIC-related structures by leveraging the `sizeof` operator.

# Functions

---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function prints the sizes of various QUIC-related structures defined in included template files.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments passed to the program.
    - `argv`: An array of strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function begins by casting `argc` and `argv` to void to indicate they are unused.
    - It prints a newline followed by the header 'frame sizes:'.
    - A macro `FD_TEMPL_DEF_STRUCT_BEGIN` is defined to print the size of a structure prefixed with 'fd_quic_' and suffixed with '_t'.
    - The macro is used in conjunction with included template files `fd_quic_dft.h` and `fd_quic_templ.h` to print the sizes of structures defined therein.
    - The macro is undefined using `fd_quic_undefs.h`.
    - The process is repeated for another set of template files `fd_quic_dft.h` and `fd_quic_frames_templ.h`.
    - Finally, the function returns 0, indicating successful execution.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer value of 0, indicating successful execution.
