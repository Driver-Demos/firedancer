# Purpose
This C source code file is designed to test and validate the functionality of QUIC packet metadata management within a QUIC protocol implementation. The code is structured around initializing and managing packet metadata, simulating various acknowledgment scenarios, and ensuring the robustness of packet metadata handling. The file includes functions to initialize packet metadata trackers, perform compile-time tests on packet metadata comparison, and execute tests under different acknowledgment conditions, such as adversarial, reasonable reordering, and happy case scenarios. These tests are crucial for verifying the correct behavior of packet metadata tracking and acknowledgment processing in a QUIC connection.

The file is an executable C program, as indicated by the presence of a [`main`](#main) function, which serves as the entry point for execution. It utilizes several components from the QUIC library, such as `fd_quic_conn_t`, `fd_quic_pkt_meta_t`, and `fd_quic_t`, to manage and test packet metadata. The code also includes logging and error handling to provide feedback on the test outcomes. The program is designed to be run with command-line arguments that specify parameters like the maximum number of inflight packets and the range size for acknowledgment processing. Overall, this file is a specialized test suite for ensuring the integrity and performance of packet metadata operations in a QUIC protocol context.

- `../fd_quic.h`
- `../fd_quic_private.h`
- `fd_quic_test_helpers.h`


# Global Variables

---
### conn
- **Type**: `fd_quic_conn_t`
- **Description**: The `conn` variable is a static instance of the `fd_quic_conn_t` structure, which is used to represent a QUIC connection in the program. It is initialized and manipulated throughout the code to manage packet metadata and track sent packets.
- **Use**: The `conn` variable is used to store and manage the state of a QUIC connection, including tracking packet metadata and handling acknowledgments.


---
### pkt\_meta\_mem
- **Type**: `fd_quic_pkt_meta_t *`
- **Description**: `pkt_meta_mem` is a pointer to a memory block allocated for storing packet metadata structures (`fd_quic_pkt_meta_t`). This memory is used to manage metadata for packets in a QUIC connection, such as packet numbers and other related information.
- **Use**: `pkt_meta_mem` is used to allocate and align memory for packet metadata, which is then utilized by the QUIC connection to track and manage packet information.


---
### quic
- **Type**: `fd_quic_t *`
- **Description**: The `quic` variable is a pointer to an `fd_quic_t` structure, which is likely used to manage and maintain the state of a QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections) protocol instance. This variable is initialized in the `main` function after calculating the required memory footprint for the QUIC instance and is used throughout the program to access and manipulate the QUIC state.
- **Use**: The `quic` variable is used to store the address of the allocated memory for the QUIC instance, allowing the program to manage QUIC connections and their associated metadata.


# Functions

---
### init\_tracker<!-- {{#callable:init_tracker}} -->
The `init_tracker` function initializes a packet metadata tracker for a QUIC connection with a specified maximum number of inflight packets.
- **Inputs**:
    - `max_inflight`: The maximum number of inflight packets that the tracker should handle.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Retrieve the packet metadata pool from the QUIC state using `fd_quic_get_state` and initialize it with `fd_quic_pkt_meta_ds_init_pool`.
    - Attempt to initialize the packet metadata tracker with `fd_quic_pkt_meta_tracker_init`; if it fails, log an error and return.
    - Iterate over the range from 0 to `max_inflight`, acquiring packet metadata elements from the pool, zeroing them out, setting their packet numbers, and inserting them into the tracker's sent packet metadata structure.
    - Verify that the number of elements in the tracker's sent packet metadata matches `max_inflight` using `FD_TEST`.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it initializes the packet metadata tracker and logs an error if initialization fails.


---
### fd\_quic\_pkt\_meta\_cmp\_test<!-- {{#callable:fd_quic_pkt_meta_cmp_test}} -->
The `fd_quic_pkt_meta_cmp_test` function tests the `fd_quic_pkt_meta_cmp` function to ensure it correctly compares packet metadata keys based on packet number, type, and stream ID.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - Log the start of the test with the message 'testing pkt_meta_cmp'.
    - Initialize two packet metadata keys, `pkt_1_big_type` and `pkt_2_small_type`, with different values for type, packet number, and stream ID.
    - Create a packet metadata object `pkt_1_big_type_e` using `pkt_1_big_type` as its key.
    - Test that comparing `pkt_1_big_type` with `pkt_1_big_type_e` returns 0, indicating equality.
    - Test that comparing `pkt_2_small_type` with `pkt_1_big_type_e` returns a positive value, indicating `pkt_2_small_type` is greater due to a higher packet number.
    - Modify `pkt_1_big_type` to create `pkt_1_big_type_small_stream_id` with a smaller stream ID and test that comparing it with `pkt_1_big_type_e` returns a negative value, indicating it is smaller due to the stream ID.
- **Output**: The function does not return any value; it performs tests and logs results to verify the correctness of the `fd_quic_pkt_meta_cmp` function.


---
### test\_adversarial\_ack<!-- {{#callable:test_adversarial_ack}} -->
The `test_adversarial_ack` function simulates and measures the performance of QUIC packet acknowledgment under various conditions, including adversarial, reasonable reordering, and happy case scenarios.
- **Inputs**:
    - `max_inflight`: The maximum number of packets that can be in flight at any given time.
    - `range_sz`: The size of the range of packet numbers to be acknowledged in each operation.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize a packet tracker with the given maximum inflight packets using [`init_tracker`](#init_tracker).
    - Enter a loop to simulate 'Very adversarial' conditions by processing acknowledgment ranges in a specific order: largest, middle, and higher than max, while measuring the time taken.
    - Reinitialize the packet tracker and simulate 'Reasonable reordering' by alternating between sending the second and first range of packet numbers, again measuring the time taken.
    - Reinitialize the packet tracker and simulate the 'Happy case' with no reordering, processing the first range of packet numbers and measuring the time taken.
    - Log the time taken for each scenario using `FD_LOG_NOTICE`.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value but logs the time taken for each acknowledgment scenario to the console.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`init_tracker`](#init_tracker)

### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function initializes and configures a QUIC testing environment, allocates necessary resources, and executes adversarial acknowledgment tests.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The count of command-line arguments passed to the program.
    - `argv`: An array of strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize the environment by calling `fd_boot` and [`fd_quic_test_boot`](fd_quic_test_helpers.c.driver.md#fd_quic_test_boot) with command-line arguments.
    - Extract `--max-inflight` and `--range-sz` values from command-line arguments with default values of 100 and 10, respectively.
    - Log the booting process with `FD_LOG_INFO`.
    - Determine the CPU index using `fd_tile_cpu_id` and adjust if it exceeds the shared memory CPU count.

    - Define `fd_quic_limits_t` structure with various limits for QUIC operations.
    - Create and join a new anonymous workspace with `fd_wksp_new_anonymous` and `fd_wksp_join`.
    - Calculate the footprint for QUIC state and allocate memory for it, adjusting the local address pointer accordingly.
    - Allocate and align memory for packet metadata, considering extra space for alignment requirements.
    - Log the allocation of space and join the packet metadata pool to the QUIC state.
