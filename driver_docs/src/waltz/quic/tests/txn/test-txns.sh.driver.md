# Purpose
This Bash script is designed to execute a specific network-related test using a precompiled binary, `test_quic_txns`, within a specified network namespace. It provides narrow functionality, primarily focusing on setting up the environment and executing the test with a given transactions file, which defaults to `tx` if not specified. The script employs Bash strict mode to ensure robust error handling and uses `nsenter` to run the test within the `veth_test_xdp_1` network namespace, indicating its use in a network testing or simulation context. Additionally, it includes commented-out lines for debugging purposes, suggesting that it is intended for development or testing environments where debugging might be necessary. Overall, this script is a utility for executing network transaction tests in a controlled environment.
# Global Variables

---
### SCRIPT\_DIR
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: `SCRIPT_DIR` is a string variable that stores the absolute path of the directory where the script is located. It is determined by using the `dirname` command on the script's source path (`BASH_SOURCE[0]`) and converting it to an absolute path with `pwd`. This ensures that the script can reliably reference its own directory regardless of the current working directory when the script is executed.
- **Use**: `SCRIPT_DIR` is used to change the current directory to the script's directory, ensuring that subsequent commands are executed in the correct context.


---
### TX\_FILE
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: The `TX_FILE` variable is a global string variable that holds the name of a file containing transaction data. It is initialized with a default value of 'tx' if no second argument is provided to the script.
- **Use**: This variable is used to specify the input file for transaction data that is piped into a network namespace command for processing.
