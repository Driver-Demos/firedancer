# Purpose
This C header file defines a set of structures and functions for managing connection timers within a QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections) service. The primary focus of the code is to facilitate the scheduling, validation, and management of connection timeouts, which are crucial for maintaining efficient and reliable network communication. The file includes definitions for structures such as `fd_quic_svc_timers_conn_meta` and `fd_quic_svc_event`, which store metadata and event information related to connection timeouts. The code provides a clear API for initializing timers, scheduling and canceling connection events, and retrieving the next scheduled event, ensuring that the service can handle multiple connections efficiently.

The header file is designed to be included in other C source files, providing a public API for managing QUIC connection timers. It includes functions for setting up the timer system ([`fd_quic_svc_timers_init`](#fd_quic_svc_timers_init)), scheduling connection timeouts ([`fd_quic_svc_schedule`](#fd_quic_svc_schedule)), and validating the integrity of the timer system ([`fd_quic_svc_timers_validate`](#fd_quic_svc_timers_validate)). The file also defines utility functions for managing the lifecycle of connection events, such as [`fd_quic_svc_cancel`](#fd_quic_svc_cancel) and [`fd_quic_svc_timers_next`](#fd_quic_svc_timers_next). By encapsulating these functionalities, the header file offers a modular and reusable component for developers working on QUIC-based applications, ensuring that connection timeouts are handled consistently and efficiently across different parts of the system.

### fd\_quic\_svc\_timers\_init\_conn<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_quic_svc_timers_init_conn}} -->
Initialize the connection's service timer metadata.
- **Description**: This function sets up the service timer metadata for a given QUIC connection. It should be called to initialize the connection's timer-related metadata before scheduling any timers for the connection. This function sets the index to an invalid state and the next timeout to the maximum possible value, effectively resetting the timer metadata. It is important to call this function before using the connection in any timer-related operations to ensure the metadata is in a known state.
- **Inputs**:
    - `conn`: A pointer to an fd_quic_conn_t structure representing the QUIC connection. The pointer must not be null, and the caller retains ownership of the connection object. The function will modify the svc_meta field of the connection to initialize the timer metadata.
- **Output**: None

---
### fd\_quic\_svc\_timers\_validate<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_quic_svc_timers_validate}} -->
Validate the consistency of service timers and connections.
- **Description**: Use this function to ensure that the service timers and connections are correctly synchronized and consistent with each other. It checks that each event in the timers array correctly references its associated connection and that each connection is properly indexed. This function should be called when you need to verify the integrity of the timer and connection setup, especially after modifications. It returns a boolean indicating the validity of the setup.
- **Inputs**:
    - `timers`: A pointer to an array of `fd_quic_svc_timers_t` structures representing the service timers. The array must be properly initialized and populated with valid events. The caller retains ownership and must ensure it is not null.
    - `quic`: A pointer to an `fd_quic_t` structure representing the QUIC state. This must be a valid, initialized instance, and the caller retains ownership. It must not be null.
- **Output**: Returns 1 if the timers and connections are valid and consistent, otherwise returns 0.

---
### fd\_quic\_svc\_cancel<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_quic_svc_cancel}} -->
Removes a connection from the service queue.
- **Description**: This function is used to remove a connection from the service queue managed by the timers. It should be called when a connection no longer needs to be tracked for service events, such as when it is being closed or no longer requires scheduled timeouts. The function checks if the connection is currently in the queue and, if so, removes it and marks it as invalid. It is safe to call this function on a connection that is not in the queue, as it will simply return without making changes.
- **Inputs**:
    - `timers`: A pointer to the fd_quic_svc_timers_t structure that manages the service queue. Must not be null.
    - `conn`: A pointer to the fd_quic_conn_t structure representing the connection to be removed from the service queue. Must not be null. The connection's svc_meta.idx field is used to determine if it is currently in the queue.

### fd\_quic\_svc\_timers\_next<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_quic_svc_timers_next}} -->
Retrieve the next scheduled event from the timers.
- **Description**: This function is used to obtain the next scheduled event from a set of timers, which are associated with QUIC connections. It can be used to either peek at the next event or to pop it from the queue if it is due. The function should be called when you need to process the next event in the queue. If the 'pop' parameter is true and the event is due (i.e., its timeout is less than or equal to 'now'), the event is removed from the queue. If the queue is empty or the next event is not due, a sentinel event with a NULL connection is returned. This function is useful for managing timed events in a QUIC service.
- **Inputs**:
    - `timers`: A pointer to the fd_quic_svc_timers_t structure, representing the queue of scheduled events. Must not be null.
    - `now`: The current time, represented as an unsigned long. It is used to determine if the next event is due.
    - `pop`: An integer flag indicating whether to remove the event from the queue if it is due. Non-zero values indicate true, and zero indicates false.
- **Output**: Returns an fd_quic_svc_event_t structure representing the next event. If the queue is empty or the next event is not due and 'pop' is true, the returned event will have a NULL connection.
- **See also**: [`fd_quic_svc_timers_next`](fd_quic_svc_q.c.driver.md#fd_quic_svc_timers_next)  (Implementation)

### fd\_quic\_svc\_get\_event<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_quic_svc_get_event}} -->
Returns a pointer to the event associated with a given connection.
- **Description**: Use this function to retrieve the event associated with a specific connection from the timers. It is useful when you need to access or modify the event details for a connection that is already scheduled. The function requires that the connection has been initialized and scheduled properly. If the connection's index is invalid, the function will return NULL, indicating that no event is associated with the connection.
- **Inputs**:
    - `timers`: A pointer to the fd_quic_svc_timers_t structure, which holds the events. The caller must ensure this is a valid and properly initialized pointer.
    - `conn`: A pointer to the fd_quic_conn_t structure representing the connection for which the event is being queried. The connection must have been initialized and scheduled; otherwise, the function may return NULL.
- **Output**: A pointer to the fd_quic_svc_event_t associated with the given connection, or NULL if the connection's index is invalid.
- **See also**: [`fd_quic_svc_get_event`](fd_quic_svc_q.c.driver.md#fd_quic_svc_get_event)  (Implementation)
