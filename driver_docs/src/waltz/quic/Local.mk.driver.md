# Purpose
The provided content is from a Makefile, which is a build automation tool used to manage the build process of a software project. This Makefile snippet is specifically configuring the build process for a library and its associated components related to "fd_quic," which appears to be a module or library within the project. The `make-lib` function is invoked to create the library, while `add-hdrs` and `add-objs` functions are used to specify the header files and object files that are part of the build process for various components of the "fd_quic" module. The conditional block at the end, controlled by `ifdef FD_HAS_HOSTED`, indicates that if the `FD_HAS_HOSTED` variable is defined, an additional binary named `fd_quic_pcap` will be built, linking it with several other components such as `fd_waltz`, `fd_tls`, `fd_ballet`, and `fd_util`. This setup ensures that the necessary files are compiled and linked correctly to produce the desired outputs.
