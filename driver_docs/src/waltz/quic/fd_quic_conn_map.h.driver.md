# Purpose
This C header file defines a data structure and associated macros for managing a map of QUIC connections, specifically tailored for use within a larger QUIC protocol implementation. The `fd_quic_conn_map` structure is defined with two fields: `conn_id`, a unique identifier for each connection, and `conn`, a pointer to a `fd_quic_conn_t` structure representing the connection details. The file uses macros to set up a dynamic map, leveraging an included template file (`fd_map_dynamic.c`) to handle map operations such as insertion and lookup. The map is designed to be efficient, with the `conn_id` serving as the key and a simple hash function (`MAP_KEY_HASH`) that directly casts the connection ID to an unsigned integer. This header is part of a modular system, likely used to manage and access multiple QUIC connections efficiently within a network application.

# Data Structures

---
### fd\_quic\_conn\_map
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `conn_id`: A unique identifier for a QUIC connection.
    - `conn`: A pointer to an fd_quic_conn_t structure representing the QUIC connection.
- **Description**: The `fd_quic_conn_map` structure is designed to map a unique connection identifier (`conn_id`) to a pointer to a QUIC connection (`conn`). It is aligned to 16 bytes for performance optimization and is used in conjunction with a dynamic map implementation to efficiently manage and access QUIC connections by their identifiers.

### fd\_quic\_conn\_map\_t
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `conn_id`: A unique identifier for a QUIC connection.
    - `conn`: A pointer to an fd_quic_conn_t structure representing the QUIC connection.
- **Description**: The `fd_quic_conn_map_t` structure is designed to map a unique connection identifier to a corresponding QUIC connection object. It is aligned to 16 bytes for performance optimization and includes a connection ID and a pointer to the connection structure. This mapping is crucial for managing and accessing QUIC connections efficiently within the system.
