# Purpose
The file is a Makefile snippet used in a build system to manage dependencies for a software project. It utilizes the `add-hdrs` and `add-objs` functions to include the header file `fd_quic_crypto_suites.h` and the object files `fd_quic_crypto_suites` and `fd_quic` in the build process, ensuring they are compiled and linked appropriately.
