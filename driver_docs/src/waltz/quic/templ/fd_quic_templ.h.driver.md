# Purpose
This C source code file defines a series of data structures that represent various packet formats and transport parameters used in network communication protocols, likely related to the QUIC protocol. The file uses a templating system, indicated by macros such as `FD_TEMPL_DEF_STRUCT_BEGIN` and `FD_TEMPL_MBR_ELEM`, to define these structures in a consistent and modular manner. The primary focus of the code is on defining the structure of different types of packets, such as Long Header Packets, Version Negotiation Packets, Initial Packets, Handshake Packets, Retry Packets, and 1-RTT Packets. Each packet type is defined with specific fields that correspond to the protocol's specifications, including connection IDs, version numbers, and payloads.

Additionally, the file includes definitions for transport parameters and frame components, such as transport parameter entries, common frame headers, ACK ranges, and ECN counts. These components are essential for managing connection parameters and acknowledging received packets in a network communication context. The code is structured to facilitate the parsing and construction of these protocol-specific data structures, making it a critical component of a network stack implementation. The use of macros and templating suggests that the code is designed for flexibility and reusability, allowing for easy adaptation to different protocol versions or extensions.
