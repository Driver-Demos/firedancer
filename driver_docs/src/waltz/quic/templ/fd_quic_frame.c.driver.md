# Purpose
This C source code file is part of a QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections) protocol implementation, specifically focusing on handling different types of QUIC frames. The file defines lookup tables and functions that facilitate the interpretation and processing of QUIC frames. It includes a lookup table for frame type flags and another for frame metric IDs, both of which are essential for identifying and managing the various frame types defined in the QUIC protocol. The use of macros and templates suggests that this file is designed to be flexible and extensible, allowing for easy updates or additions to the frame types and their associated handling logic.

The file also includes a macro-based mechanism to generate frame interpreter functions, which decode and handle specific frame types. This is achieved through a templated approach, where the macro `FD_TEMPL_DEF_STRUCT_BEGIN` is used to define functions that decode a frame from a buffer and then handle it using the appropriate handler function. The inclusion of header files like `fd_quic_frame.h`, `fd_quic_dft.h`, `fd_quic_frames_templ.h`, and `fd_quic_undefs.h` indicates that this file is part of a larger framework or library for QUIC protocol handling. The file does not define public APIs directly but provides essential internal functionality that supports the broader QUIC implementation.

- `fd_quic_frame.h`
- `fd_quic_dft.h`
- `fd_quic_frames_templ.h`
- `fd_quic_undefs.h`


# Global Variables

### fd\_quic\_frame\_metric\_id
- **Type**: `uchar const`
- **Description**: The `fd_quic_frame_metric_id` is a statically defined constant array of unsigned characters, aligned to a 32-byte boundary, which maps each QUIC frame type to its corresponding metric ID. The array is indexed by frame type, and each entry is initialized using a macro that assigns the metric ID for that frame type.
- **Use**: This variable is used as a lookup table to quickly retrieve the metric ID associated with a specific QUIC frame type.
