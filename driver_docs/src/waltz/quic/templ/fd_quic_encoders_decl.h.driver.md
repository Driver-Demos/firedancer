# Purpose
This code is a C header file that defines macros for generating inline function declarations related to encoding operations in a QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections) protocol implementation. The `FD_TEMPL_DEF_STRUCT_BEGIN` macro is used to declare two inline functions for a given structure `NAME`: one for encoding the structure into a buffer (`fd_quic_encode_##NAME`) and another for determining the memory footprint required for encoding (`fd_quic_encode_footprint_##NAME`). The `fd_quic_##NAME##_t` is a placeholder for a specific QUIC-related data structure. The inclusion of "fd_quic_dft.h" suggests that this header file relies on additional definitions or templates provided in that file, likely to handle various QUIC frame types. This setup facilitates the modular and reusable definition of encoding functions for different QUIC frames.
