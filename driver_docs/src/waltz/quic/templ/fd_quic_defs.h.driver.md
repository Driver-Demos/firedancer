# Purpose
This code is a C header file template designed for defining structures related to the QUIC protocol, specifically for use in a project involving the Fast Data (FD) framework. It provides a set of macros to facilitate the creation of structured data types, which are prefixed with `fd_quic_`, indicating their association with the QUIC protocol. The macros define various types of structure members, including standard elements, hidden elements, variable-length integers, packet numbers, and raw data arrays. The template also includes a mechanism for defining the beginning and end of a structure, ensuring that each structure is properly encapsulated and typedef'd for ease of use. The inclusion of `fd_quic_dft.h` suggests that this file is part of a larger system where default configurations or additional definitions are provided.
