# Purpose
This C source code file provides functionality for pretty-printing data structures, specifically tailored for use with QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections) protocol data types. The code defines a series of macros that facilitate the generation of formatted output strings, which are useful for debugging or logging purposes. The macros are designed to handle various data types, including unsigned integers and arrays, and they format these data types into human-readable strings. The formatted output is written into a buffer, with careful management of buffer size to prevent overflow.

The file is not an executable on its own but rather a utility intended to be included in other C programs, as indicated by the use of macros and the inclusion of a header file (`fd_quic_dft.h`). The macros defined in this file, such as `FD_TEMPL_DEF_STRUCT_BEGIN` and `FD_TEMPL_DEF_STRUCT_END`, are used to wrap the pretty-printing logic for different structures, allowing for flexible and reusable code. This file does not define public APIs or external interfaces directly but provides internal functionality that can be leveraged by other components of a larger system dealing with QUIC protocol data.
