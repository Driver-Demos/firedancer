# Purpose
This code is a C preprocessor macro definition and an inclusion of a header file. The macro `FD_TEMPL_DEF_STRUCT_BEGIN(NAME)` is designed to generate a function prototype for dumping the contents of a structure associated with QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections) protocol, specifically for a structure named `fd_quic_##NAME##_t`. The macro takes a single argument `NAME`, which is used to construct the function name `fd_quic_dump_struct_##NAME`. The inclusion of `"fd_quic_dft.h"` suggests that this file is part of a larger codebase dealing with QUIC protocol, and the header likely contains additional definitions or declarations related to QUIC structures. This setup is typical in C for creating flexible and reusable code components, especially in network protocol implementations.
