# Purpose
This C source code file is a collection of macros designed to facilitate the structured output of data from QUIC protocol structures. It defines a series of macros for formatting and printing various data types, such as unsigned integers and hexadecimal values, which are commonly used in network protocol debugging and analysis. The macros are used to generate functions that print the contents of structures, specifically those related to the QUIC protocol, in a human-readable format. The file includes macros for handling different types of data members, including fixed-size elements, variable-length arrays, and raw byte sequences. The inclusion of "fd_quic_dft.h" suggests that this file is part of a larger framework or library for handling QUIC protocol data structures.
