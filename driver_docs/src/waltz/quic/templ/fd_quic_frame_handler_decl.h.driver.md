# Purpose
This code is a C header file that defines a macro for beginning the declaration of a static function, specifically for handling QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections) protocol frames. It uses conditional compilation to define a default type for `FD_TEMPL_FRAME_CTX` if it is not already defined, defaulting to `void`. The macro `FD_TEMPL_DEF_STRUCT_BEGIN` is designed to generate a function prototype for handling a specific QUIC frame type, where `NAME` is a placeholder for the frame type, and it takes a context, data structure, and a pointer to a buffer with its size as parameters. The inclusion of `"fd_quic_dft.h"` suggests that this file is part of a larger framework or library dealing with QUIC protocol operations, and it likely relies on definitions or declarations provided in the included header.
