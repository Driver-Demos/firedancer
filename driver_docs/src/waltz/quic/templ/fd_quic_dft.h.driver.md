# Purpose
This C header file provides default macro definitions intended to simplify the use of templates in C code. It defines a series of preprocessor directives that act as placeholders for various template elements, such as structure beginnings and endings, and different types of member elements (e.g., variable integers, packet numbers, raw data). Each macro is conditionally defined only if it hasn't been previously defined, allowing for customization or overriding in other parts of the codebase. This approach is useful for creating flexible and reusable code templates, particularly in projects that require consistent structuring of data or configuration elements across multiple files or modules.
