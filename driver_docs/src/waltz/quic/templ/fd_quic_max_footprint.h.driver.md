# Purpose
This C header file defines a set of macros used to calculate the maximum memory footprint required for encoding QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections) frames at compile time. The macros construct temporary structures with character arrays to determine the sizes of various frame components, allowing developers to compute the maximum size needed for encoding without using packed structures. The `FD_QUIC_MAX_FOOTPRINT` macro calculates the maximum footprint for a given frame, while other macros like `FD_TEMPL_ENCODE_FP`, `FD_TEMPL_MBR_FRAME_TYPE`, and `FD_TEMPL_MBR_ELEM` define the size of different elements within a frame. This approach ensures efficient memory allocation by determining the size of encoded data elements, such as packet numbers and variable-length integers, at compile time. The file includes another header, `fd_quic_dft.h`, which likely contains additional definitions or implementations related to QUIC encoding.
