# Purpose
This C header file defines a set of macros for calculating the footprint, or the upper bound of the number of bytes, required to encode various QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections) protocol data structures without actually performing the encoding. The macros are designed to be used in conjunction with specific data types and structures, prefixed with `fd_quic_`, to determine the size of encoded data. The file includes macros for handling different types of data elements, such as frame types, packet numbers, variable-length integers, and raw byte arrays, each contributing a specific number of bytes to the total footprint. The macros are structured to facilitate the definition of functions that compute the total byte size needed for encoding, which is useful for memory allocation and buffer management in QUIC implementations. The inclusion of "fd_quic_dft.h" suggests that this file is part of a larger framework or library for handling QUIC protocol operations.
