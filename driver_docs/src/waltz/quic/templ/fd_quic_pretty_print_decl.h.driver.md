# Purpose
This code is a C header file snippet that defines a macro for generating function declarations related to pretty-printing structures in a QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections) protocol context. The macro `FD_TEMPL_DEF_STRUCT_BEGIN(NAME)` is designed to create an inline function declaration named `fd_quic_pretty_print_struct_##NAME`, which takes a constant pointer to a structure of type `fd_quic_##NAME##_t` as its parameter. This setup suggests that the macro is used to facilitate the creation of functions that output human-readable representations of various QUIC-related data structures. The inclusion of `"fd_quic_dft.h"` indicates that this file likely relies on definitions or declarations provided in that header, possibly related to default settings or additional macros for the QUIC protocol implementation.
