# Purpose
This code is a C preprocessor directive file that undefines a series of macros, likely used in a templated structure definition system. The macros, prefixed with `FD_TEMPL_`, suggest a framework for defining and manipulating structured data, possibly for network packet processing or data serialization. By undefining these macros, the file ensures that any previous definitions are removed, preventing potential conflicts or redefinitions in subsequent code. This is typically done to maintain clean and modular code, especially in larger projects where these macros might be redefined with different implementations or parameters. The file serves as a cleanup or reset mechanism in the preprocessing stage of compilation.
