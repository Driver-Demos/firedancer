# Purpose
This C source code file is part of a larger system that manages QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections) service timers, specifically focusing on scheduling and handling events related to QUIC connections. The file defines a set of functions and data structures that facilitate the management of service events in a priority queue, which is crucial for handling timeouts and scheduling tasks efficiently. The code includes setup functions to initialize the timer structures and align memory, as well as task functions to schedule, cancel, and validate service events. The use of macros and inclusion of a template file (`fd_prq.c`) suggests that the priority queue operations are abstracted for reuse across different parts of the system.

The primary technical components include the `fd_quic_svc_timers_t` structure, which represents the timer system, and the `fd_quic_svc_event_t` structure, which encapsulates individual service events. The code provides a narrow functionality focused on managing the lifecycle of QUIC connection events, ensuring that connections are scheduled, canceled, and validated correctly within the system. It does not define public APIs or external interfaces directly but rather serves as an internal component of a larger QUIC service management library. The functions are designed to be used by other parts of the system that require precise timing and scheduling of QUIC connection events, ensuring efficient and reliable network communication.

The `fd_quic_svc_timers_footprint` function calculates the memory footprint required for service timers based on the maximum number of connections.
- **Inputs**:
    - `max_conn`: The maximum number of connections for which the service timers' memory footprint is to be calculated.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize a variable `offset` to 0.
    - Align `offset` to the alignment required by the priority queue using `fd_ulong_align_up` and `fd_quic_svc_queue_prq_align`.
    - Add the memory footprint required for the priority queue, calculated by `fd_quic_svc_queue_prq_footprint`, to `offset`.
    - Return the calculated `offset` as the total memory footprint.
- **Output**: The function returns an `ulong` representing the total memory footprint required for the service timers, aligned and calculated based on the maximum number of connections.

### fd\_quic\_svc\_timers\_align<!-- {{#callable:fd_quic_svc_timers_align}} -->
The `fd_quic_svc_timers_align` function returns the maximum alignment requirement between the `fd_quic_svc_timers_t` structure and the alignment of the priority queue used in QUIC service timers.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function calls `fd_ulong_max` with two arguments: `alignof(fd_quic_svc_timers_t)` and `fd_quic_svc_queue_prq_align()`.

    - `conn`: A pointer to an `fd_quic_conn_t` structure representing a QUIC connection whose service metadata is to be initialized.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Set the `svc_meta.idx` field of the `conn` structure to `FD_QUIC_SVC_IDX_INVAL`, indicating an invalid index.
    - Set the `svc_meta.next_timeout` field of the `conn` structure to `ULONG_MAX`, representing the maximum possible timeout value.
- **Output**: This function does not return any value; it modifies the `conn` structure in place.

### fd\_quic\_svc\_cancel<!-- {{#callable:fd_quic_svc_cancel}} -->
The `fd_quic_svc_cancel` function removes a connection from the service queue and marks it as invalid.
- **Inputs**:
    - `timers`: A pointer to `fd_quic_svc_timers_t`, which manages the service queue of connections.
    - `conn`: A pointer to `fd_quic_conn_t`, representing the connection to be removed from the service queue.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if the connection's service metadata index is invalid (`FD_QUIC_SVC_IDX_INVAL`); if so, return immediately.
    - Call `fd_quic_svc_queue_prq_remove` to remove the connection from the service queue using its index.
    - Set the connection's service metadata index to `FD_QUIC_SVC_IDX_INVAL` to mark it as invalid.
- **Output**: This function does not return any value.


---
### fd\_quic\_svc\_schedule<!-- {{#callable:fd_quic_svc_schedule}} -->
The `fd_quic_svc_schedule` function schedules a QUIC connection's service event by updating or inserting it into a priority queue based on its timeout value.
- **Inputs**:
    - `timers`: A pointer to the array of service timers (`fd_quic_svc_timers_t`) which acts as a priority queue for managing connection timeouts.
    - `conn`: A pointer to the QUIC connection (`fd_quic_conn_t`) whose service event is being scheduled.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Retrieve the current index (`idx`) and next timeout (`expiry`) from the connection's service metadata.
    - Check if the connection is already scheduled (i.e., `idx` is not `FD_QUIC_SVC_IDX_INVAL`).
    - If scheduled, retrieve the current expiry time from the event at the index in the timers array.
    - If the current expiry matches the new expiry, return without changes.
    - If the current expiry is less than the new expiry, return without changes.
    - If the current expiry is greater than the new expiry, remove the event from the priority queue and mark the connection as unscheduled by setting its index to `FD_QUIC_SVC_IDX_INVAL`.
    - Create a new service event with the connection and its expiry time.
    - Insert the new event into the priority queue.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it modifies the state of the `timers` and `conn` to reflect the updated scheduling of the connection's service event.

- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize a `fd_quic_svc_event_t` structure `next` with default values indicating no event is available.
    - Check if the priority queue is empty using `fd_quic_svc_queue_prq_cnt`; if so, return `next`.
    - If `pop` is true, check if the current time `now` is less than the timeout of the first event in the queue; if so, return `next`.
    - If `pop` is true and the timeout has been reached, set `next` to the first event, invalidate its index, and remove it from the queue using `fd_quic_svc_queue_prq_remove_min`.
    - If `pop` is false, simply set `next` to the first event in the queue without removing it.
    - Return the `next` event.
