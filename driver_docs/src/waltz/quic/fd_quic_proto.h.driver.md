# Purpose
This C header file, `fd_quic_proto.h`, is part of a larger library or application that deals with the QUIC protocol, specifically focusing on the encoding and decoding of network protocol headers such as IPv4 and UDP. The file provides inline functions for parsing and encoding these headers, converting them between network byte order and host byte order. This functionality is crucial for network communication, ensuring that data is correctly interpreted regardless of the underlying hardware architecture. The file includes several other headers, indicating that it is part of a modular system, likely providing a broad range of functionalities related to the QUIC protocol.

The file defines static inline functions, which suggests that it is intended to be included in other C source files rather than being compiled on its own. This approach allows for efficient code reuse and inlining by the compiler, reducing function call overhead. The use of macros and templates, as indicated by the included template files, suggests a design that emphasizes flexibility and reusability, allowing the same code to be adapted for different data structures or protocols. The file does not define public APIs or external interfaces directly but rather provides low-level utilities that are likely used internally within the broader QUIC implementation.

# Global Variables

---
### fd\_quic\_decode\_ip4
- **Type**: `function`
- **Description**: `fd_quic_decode_ip4` is a static inline function that decodes an IPv4 header from a buffer into a structure of type `fd_ip4_hdr_t`. It checks if the buffer size is sufficient and if the version and header length are valid before performing the decoding.
- **Use**: This function is used to parse an IPv4 header from a network buffer into a host byte order structure for further processing.


---
### fd\_quic\_decode\_udp
- **Type**: `function`
- **Description**: The `fd_quic_decode_udp` function is a static inline function that decodes a UDP header from a buffer into a `fd_udp_hdr_t` structure. It checks if the buffer size is sufficient to contain a UDP header and then copies and byte-swaps the header data into the output structure.
- **Use**: This function is used to parse UDP headers from network data into a host byte order format for further processing.


# Functions

---
### fd\_quic\_encode\_ip4<!-- {{#callable:fd_quic_encode_ip4}} -->
The `fd_quic_encode_ip4` function encodes an IPv4 header from host byte order to network byte order and writes it to a buffer for transmission.
- **Inputs**:
    - `buf`: A pointer to a buffer where the encoded IPv4 header will be written.
    - `sz`: The size of the buffer `buf` in bytes.
    - `frame`: A pointer to an `fd_ip4_hdr_t` structure representing the IPv4 header in host byte order.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if the buffer size `sz` is smaller than the size of an IPv4 header; if so, return `FD_QUIC_PARSE_FAIL`.
    - Copy the IPv4 header from `frame` to a local variable `netorder`.
    - Convert the byte order of `netorder` from host to network using `fd_ip4_hdr_bswap`.
    - Copy the converted `netorder` to the buffer `buf`.
    - Return the size of the IPv4 header, indicating the number of bytes written.
- **Output**: The function returns the number of bytes written to the buffer, which is the size of an IPv4 header, or `FD_QUIC_PARSE_FAIL` if the buffer size is insufficient.


---
### fd\_quic\_encode\_udp<!-- {{#callable:fd_quic_encode_udp}} -->
The `fd_quic_encode_udp` function encodes a UDP header from host byte order to network byte order and writes it to a buffer for transmission.
- **Inputs**:
    - `buf`: A pointer to a buffer where the encoded UDP header will be written.
    - `sz`: The size of the buffer `buf` in bytes.
    - `frame`: A pointer to a `fd_udp_hdr_t` structure representing the UDP header in host byte order.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if the buffer size `sz` is smaller than the size of a UDP header; if so, return `FD_QUIC_PARSE_FAIL`.
    - Copy the UDP header from `frame` to a temporary variable `netorder`.
    - Convert the byte order of `netorder` from host to network using `fd_udp_hdr_bswap`.
    - Copy the network byte order UDP header from `netorder` to the buffer `buf`.
    - Return the size of the UDP header, indicating the number of bytes written to the buffer.
- **Output**: The function returns the number of bytes written to the buffer, which is the size of a UDP header, or `FD_QUIC_PARSE_FAIL` if the buffer size is insufficient.
