# Purpose
This C header file defines a collection of macros and constants used in the context of a QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections) protocol implementation. It includes definitions for stream types, error codes, packet types, and various configuration parameters such as MTU size, payload sizes, and connection roles. The file also specifies alignment requirements and cryptographic parameters for AES-128-GCM, which are essential for secure data transmission. Additionally, it provides constants for stream notifications and packet handling limits, facilitating the management of QUIC connections and data flow. Overall, this header file serves as a configuration and enumeration resource for developers working with QUIC protocol implementations, ensuring consistent and efficient handling of network communications.
