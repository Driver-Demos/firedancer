# Purpose
This code is a C header file that serves as an inclusion guard for a set of QUIC protocol-related definitions and templates. It prevents multiple inclusions of the same header file, which can lead to compilation errors. The file includes several other headers, such as `fd_quic_common.h` and `fd_quic_types.h`, which likely contain common definitions and type declarations used across the QUIC protocol implementation. Additionally, it includes a series of template headers (`fd_quic_defs.h`, `fd_quic_templ.h`, `fd_quic_frames_templ.h`, and `fd_quic_undefs.h`), suggesting that it is part of a templated system for defining and managing QUIC protocol structures and frames. This header file is likely part of a larger library or application that implements the QUIC protocol, a modern transport layer network protocol.
