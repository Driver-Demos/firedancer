# Purpose
This code is a C header file that defines a structure and a function prototype related to pretty-printing QUIC packets. The `fd_quic_pretty_print` structure is defined with a single integer member `x`, which appears to be a placeholder, suggesting that the structure might be expanded in the future or is used for type consistency. The typedef `fd_quic_pretty_print_t` provides an alias for this structure. The function [`fd_quic_pretty_print_quic_pkt`](#fd_quic_pretty_print_quic_pkt) is declared to take several parameters, including a pointer to the `fd_quic_pretty_print_t` structure, a timestamp, a buffer with its size, a flow identifier, and source IP and UDP port information, likely for the purpose of formatting or logging QUIC packet details in a human-readable form. The header guards prevent multiple inclusions of this file, ensuring that the declarations are only processed once during compilation.
# Data Structures

---
### fd\_quic\_pretty\_print
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `x`: An integer field that serves as a placeholder or dummy variable.
- **Description**: The `fd_quic_pretty_print` structure is a simple data structure containing a single integer field `x`, which is described as a dummy variable. This suggests that the structure is likely a placeholder or a preliminary design for a more complex data structure that may be developed in the future. The typedef `fd_quic_pretty_print_t` is defined for ease of use, indicating that this structure might be intended for use in functions related to QUIC packet pretty-printing, as suggested by the function `fd_quic_pretty_print_quic_pkt`.


---
### fd\_quic\_pretty\_print\_t
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `x`: A placeholder integer field, likely not needed for the intended functionality.
- **Description**: The `fd_quic_pretty_print_t` is a structure that currently contains a single integer member `x`, which appears to be a placeholder or dummy field. The structure is defined in the context of a function `fd_quic_pretty_print_quic_pkt`, suggesting its intended use is related to pretty-printing QUIC packets, although the structure itself does not currently encapsulate any meaningful data for this purpose.


# Function Declarations (Public API)

---
### fd\_quic\_pretty\_print\_quic\_pkt<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_quic_pretty_print_quic_pkt}} -->
Formats and prints a QUIC packet as a JSON string.
- **Description**: This function is used to format a QUIC packet into a JSON string representation and print it to the standard output. It is useful for debugging and logging purposes, providing a human-readable format of the packet's contents. The function requires a valid buffer containing the packet data and its size, along with metadata such as the flow identifier, source IP address, and source UDP port. If the packet cannot be parsed, the function returns an error code. The function does not modify the input buffer or the pretty_print structure.
- **Inputs**:
    - `pretty_print`: A pointer to an fd_quic_pretty_print_t structure. This parameter is currently unused and can be NULL.
    - `now`: A timestamp representing the current time. This parameter is currently unused.
    - `buf`: A pointer to a buffer containing the QUIC packet data. Must not be NULL. If NULL, the function returns FD_QUIC_PARSE_FAIL.
    - `buf_sz`: The size of the buffer pointed to by buf. Must accurately represent the size of the packet data.
    - `flow`: A string representing the flow identifier. Must be a valid, null-terminated string.
    - `ip4_saddr`: The source IPv4 address of the packet, in network byte order.
    - `udp_sport`: The source UDP port of the packet, in network byte order.
- **Output**: Returns an unsigned long indicating success or FD_QUIC_PARSE_FAIL on failure. The function prints the JSON representation of the packet to standard output.
