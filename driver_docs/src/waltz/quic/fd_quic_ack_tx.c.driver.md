# Purpose
This C source code file is part of a QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections) protocol implementation, specifically focusing on the acknowledgment (ACK) management aspect of the protocol. The code provides functionality for handling ACK packet generation and management, which is crucial for ensuring reliable data transmission over the inherently unreliable UDP protocol. The file includes functions to extend packet number ranges, manage ACK packet queues, and generate ACK frames for transmission. The primary components include functions like [`fd_quic_ack_pkt`](#fd_quic_ack_pkt), which handles the acknowledgment of received packets by either merging them into existing ACK ranges or creating new ones, and [`fd_quic_gen_ack_frames`](#fd_quic_gen_ack_frames), which generates the actual ACK frames to be sent over the network.

The code is structured to efficiently manage ACKs by maintaining a queue of ACK packets and ensuring that ACK frames are generated only when necessary, thus preventing unnecessary network traffic. It includes mechanisms to handle packet reordering and overflow conditions, ensuring robustness in various network conditions. The file is intended to be part of a larger QUIC library, as indicated by the inclusion of private and protocol-specific headers, and it defines internal functions rather than public APIs, suggesting that it is not meant to be directly interfaced by external code but rather used within the QUIC implementation itself.

# Functions

---
### fd\_quic\_range\_can\_extend<!-- {{#callable:fd_quic_range_can_extend}} -->
The `fd_quic_range_can_extend` function checks if a given index can be included in a specified range by extending it.
- **Inputs**:
    - `range`: A pointer to a `fd_quic_range_t` structure representing the range to be checked.
    - `idx`: An unsigned long integer representing the index to be checked for inclusion in the range.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function checks if `idx + 1` is greater than or equal to `range->offset_lo` and if `idx` is less than or equal to `range->offset_hi`.
    - If both conditions are true, the function returns true (non-zero), indicating that the index can be included in the range by extending it.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer value, which is non-zero if the index can be included in the range by extending it, and zero otherwise.


---
### fd\_quic\_range\_extend<!-- {{#callable:fd_quic_range_extend}} -->
The `fd_quic_range_extend` function updates the range of packet numbers by extending its lower and upper bounds based on a given index.
- **Inputs**:
    - `range`: A pointer to an `fd_quic_range_t` structure representing the current range of packet numbers.
    - `idx`: An unsigned long integer representing the packet number index to be included in the range.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if the given index `idx` is less than the current lower bound `offset_lo` of the range, setting `lo_decreased` to true if it is.
    - Check if the given index `idx` is greater than or equal to the current upper bound `offset_hi` of the range, setting `hi_increased` to true if it is.
    - Update the lower bound `offset_lo` of the range to the minimum of its current value and `idx`.
    - Update the upper bound `offset_hi` of the range to the maximum of its current value and `idx + 1`.
    - Return true if either the lower bound decreased or the upper bound increased, indicating that the range was extended.
- **Output**: Returns an integer that is true (non-zero) if the range was extended, either by decreasing the lower bound or increasing the upper bound, and false (zero) otherwise.


---
### fd\_quic\_ack\_pkt<!-- {{#callable:fd_quic_ack_pkt}} -->
The `fd_quic_ack_pkt` function manages the acknowledgment (ACK) of QUIC packets by either merging the packet number into an existing ACK range or creating a new ACK entry in the queue.
- **Inputs**:
    - `gen`: A pointer to an `fd_quic_ack_gen_t` structure, which manages the state of the ACK generation queue.
    - `pkt_number`: The packet number of the QUIC packet to be acknowledged.
    - `enc_level`: The encryption level of the packet, indicating the security context in which the packet was sent.
    - `now`: The current timestamp, used to update the timestamp of the ACK entry.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if the packet number is unused; if so, return `FD_QUIC_ACK_TX_NOOP`.
    - Retrieve the most recent ACK entry from the queue and check if the packet number can be merged into this entry based on the encryption level and range.
    - If the packet number can be merged, update the timestamp if necessary, extend the range, and re-enqueue the ACK if the range changed and the queue is empty, then return `FD_QUIC_ACK_TX_MERGED`.
    - If the packet number cannot be merged and the queue is full, return `FD_QUIC_ACK_TX_ENOSPC`.
    - If the queue is not full, create a new ACK entry with the packet number, encryption level, and timestamp, increment the queue head, and return `FD_QUIC_ACK_TX_NEW`.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer status code indicating the result of the operation: `FD_QUIC_ACK_TX_NOOP`, `FD_QUIC_ACK_TX_MERGED`, `FD_QUIC_ACK_TX_ENOSPC`, or `FD_QUIC_ACK_TX_NEW`.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`fd_quic_range_can_extend`](#fd_quic_range_can_extend)
    - [`fd_quic_range_extend`](#fd_quic_range_extend)

### fd\_quic\_ack\_gen\_abandon\_enc\_level<!-- {{#callable:fd_quic_ack_gen_abandon_enc_level}} -->
The function `fd_quic_ack_gen_abandon_enc_level` discards ACKs from a queue that have an encryption level less than or equal to a specified level.
- **Inputs**:
    - `gen`: A pointer to an `fd_quic_ack_gen_t` structure, which represents the generator containing the queue of ACKs.
    - `enc_level`: An unsigned integer representing the encryption level threshold for discarding ACKs.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Iterates over the ACKs in the queue from the current tail to the head.
    - For each ACK, checks if its encryption level is greater than the specified `enc_level`.
    - If an ACK with a higher encryption level is found, the loop breaks, stopping further discards.
    - Logs a debug message for each discarded ACK, indicating the generator, encryption level, packet number range, and sequence number.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it modifies the state of the `fd_quic_ack_gen_t` structure by advancing the tail to abandon certain ACKs.


---
### fd\_quic\_gen\_ack\_frames<!-- {{#callable:fd_quic_gen_ack_frames}} -->
The `fd_quic_gen_ack_frames` function generates and encodes ACK frames for QUIC protocol based on pending ACK-eliciting packets and writes them to a specified payload buffer.
- **Inputs**:
    - `gen`: A pointer to an `fd_quic_ack_gen_t` structure that manages the state of ACK generation.
    - `payload_ptr`: A pointer to the start of the buffer where the ACK frames will be written.
    - `payload_end`: A pointer to the end of the buffer, used to ensure the buffer is not overrun.
    - `enc_level`: An unsigned integer representing the encryption level required for the ACK frames.
    - `now`: A timestamp representing the current time, used to calculate the ACK delay.
    - `tick_per_us`: A float representing the conversion factor from ticks to microseconds, used to calculate the ACK delay in microseconds.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if there is an ACK-eliciting packet pending; if not, return the current payload pointer.
    - Iterate over the ACK queue from `tail` to `head`, processing each pending ACK.
    - For each ACK, check if the encryption level matches the required level; if not, break the loop.
    - Calculate the ACK delay in microseconds using the current time and the timestamp of the ACK.
    - If the packet number range is valid, create an ACK frame with the appropriate fields.
    - Attempt to encode the ACK frame into the payload buffer; if encoding fails due to insufficient space, break the loop.
    - Update the payload pointer to reflect the added frame size.
    - If all ACK frames are processed, reset the `is_elicited` flag; otherwise, log that not all frames were flushed.
- **Output**: Returns a pointer to the updated position in the payload buffer after writing the ACK frames.
