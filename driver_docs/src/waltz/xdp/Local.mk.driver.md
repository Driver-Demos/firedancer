# Purpose
This is a Makefile snippet used for building and testing components in a software project. It conditionally adds header files and object files to the build process if the environment supports hosted and Linux configurations. Additionally, it defines and runs a unit test for the `test_xdp_ebpf` component, ensuring it is built and executed with the specified dependencies.
