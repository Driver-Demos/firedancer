# Purpose
This C source code file is designed to facilitate the installation and management of eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter) programs for XDP (eXpress Data Path) on a Linux system. The code provides a specialized functionality focused on network packet processing, specifically targeting UDP traffic on specified ports. It includes the definition of constants and structures necessary for compatibility with older kernel headers, ensuring broader usability across different Linux distributions. The file contains two primary functions: [`fd_xdp_gen_program`](#fd_xdp_gen_program), which generates an eBPF program to filter and redirect network packets based on specified criteria, and [`fd_xdp_install`](#fd_xdp_install), which installs the generated eBPF program onto a network interface, setting up the necessary BPF maps and handling potential errors during the installation process.

The code is structured to be part of a larger system, likely a library or module, that interacts with the Linux kernel's networking stack. It includes headers and dependencies that suggest integration with other components, such as `fd_xdp_license.h` and `fd_linux_bpf.h`, indicating a modular design. The file does not define a public API or external interface directly but rather provides internal functionality that can be utilized by other parts of the system to enable high-performance packet processing using XDP. The use of eBPF and XDP highlights the code's focus on achieving low-latency and efficient packet handling, which is crucial for applications requiring fast network data processing, such as network monitoring, security, or high-frequency trading systems.

# Data Structures

---
### bpf\_link\_create
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `prog_fd`: File descriptor for the BPF program to be linked.
    - `target_ifindex`: Index of the network interface to which the BPF program will be attached.
    - `attach_type`: Type of attachment, indicating how the BPF program will be linked to the interface.
    - `flags`: Flags that modify the behavior of the BPF link creation.
- **Description**: The `bpf_link_create` structure is used to define the parameters required to create a BPF link, which involves attaching a BPF program to a specific network interface. This structure includes the file descriptor of the BPF program, the index of the target network interface, the type of attachment, and any additional flags that influence the link creation process. The structure is aligned to 8 bytes to ensure proper memory alignment for efficient access.


# Functions

---
### fd\_xdp\_gen\_program<!-- {{#callable:fd_xdp_gen_program}} -->
The `fd_xdp_gen_program` function generates an eBPF program for XDP (eXpress Data Path) to filter and redirect UDP packets based on specified IP and port criteria.
- **Inputs**:
    - `code_buf`: A buffer of 512 unsigned long integers to store the generated eBPF instructions.
    - `xsks_fd`: The file descriptor for the XSK map used for redirecting packets.
    - `listen_ip4_addr`: The IPv4 address to filter incoming packets; if set to 0, this filter is ignored.
    - `ports`: An array of port numbers to filter incoming UDP packets.
    - `ports_cnt`: The number of ports in the `ports` array, with a maximum of 16.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if `ports_cnt` exceeds 16 and log an error if true.
    - Initialize the eBPF instruction buffer `code_buf` with instructions to load packet data and check for IPv4 and UDP headers.
    - If `listen_ip4_addr` is non-zero, add instructions to filter packets by destination IP address.
    - Add instructions to filter packets by UDP protocol and calculate the UDP header offset.
    - Iterate over the `ports` array, adding instructions to filter packets by destination port and redirect matching packets.
    - Define labels for passing and redirecting packets, with instructions to return `XDP_PASS` or call `bpf_redirect_map` respectively.
    - Calculate the number of instructions generated and log the eBPF program in hexadecimal format.
    - Iterate over the generated instructions to fill in jump labels for conditional branches.
- **Output**: Returns the number of eBPF instructions generated and stored in `code_buf`.

### fd\_xdp\_install<!-- {{#callable:fd_xdp_install}} -->
The `fd_xdp_install` function installs an eBPF XDP program on a specified network interface to listen for UDP packets on given ports and in a specified XDP mode.
- **Inputs**:
    - `if_idx`: The index of the network interface on which to install the XDP program.
    - `listen_ip4_addr`: The IPv4 address to listen for incoming packets, or 0 to listen on all addresses.
    - `ports_cnt`: The number of UDP ports to listen on.
    - `ports`: An array of UDP port numbers to listen on.
    - `xdp_mode`: A string specifying the XDP mode, which can be 'skb', 'drv', 'hw', or 'generic'.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize `uxdp_mode` based on the `xdp_mode` string, logging an error if the mode is unknown.
    - Count the number of non-zero ports in the `ports` array, logging an error if none are specified.
    - Create an XSK map using `bpf` system call and log an error if creation fails.
    - Generate the eBPF program code using [`fd_xdp_gen_program`](#fd_xdp_gen_program) and store it in `code_buf`.
    - Load the eBPF program into the kernel using `bpf` system call, logging an error if loading fails.
    - Create a BPF link to attach the program to the specified network interface, logging an error if creation fails.
    - Close the program file descriptor and log an error if closing fails.
    - Return a `fd_xdp_fds_t` structure containing the file descriptors for the XSK map and program link.
- **Output**: A `fd_xdp_fds_t` structure containing the file descriptors for the XSK map and the program link.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`fd_xdp_gen_program`](#fd_xdp_gen_program)
