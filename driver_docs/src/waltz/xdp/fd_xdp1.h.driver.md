# Purpose
This C header file defines structures and functions for managing eXpress Data Path (XDP) programs, which are used to process network packets at a high performance level in the Linux kernel. It includes a structure `fd_xdp_fds` to hold file descriptors related to XDP socket maps and BPF program links. The file declares two main functions: [`fd_xdp_gen_program`](#fd_xdp_gen_program), which generates a BPF program code buffer for handling UDP traffic, and [`fd_xdp_install`](#fd_xdp_install), which installs this BPF program on a specified network interface to filter and direct UDP traffic to specific ports using an XSK map. The installation function ensures that the BPF program remains active by maintaining a link, and it provides error handling by terminating the process if installation fails. This header is part of a larger system likely focused on network performance optimization using XDP and BPF technologies.

# Data Structures

### fd\_xdp\_fds
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `xsk_map_fd`: An integer file descriptor for the XSK map.
    - `prog_link_fd`: An integer file descriptor for the BPF program link.
- **Description**: The `fd_xdp_fds` structure is used to manage file descriptors related to XDP (eXpress Data Path) operations. It contains two integer fields: `xsk_map_fd`, which holds the file descriptor for the XSK map used to manage socket file descriptors for packet processing, and `prog_link_fd`, which holds the file descriptor for the BPF program link, ensuring the program remains attached to the network interface. This structure is crucial for maintaining the state and resources needed for efficient packet processing in high-performance networking applications.

### fd\_xdp\_fds\_t
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `xsk_map_fd`: An integer file descriptor for the XSK map.
    - `prog_link_fd`: An integer file descriptor for the BPF program link.

# Function Declarations (Public API)

---
### fd\_xdp\_gen\_program<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_xdp_gen_program}} -->
Generates an XDP program for filtering and redirecting UDP traffic.
- **Description**: This function is used to generate an eBPF program that filters and redirects UDP traffic based on specified criteria. It should be called when you need to create a program that processes network packets in the XDP (eXpress Data Path) context. The function requires a buffer to store the generated code, a file descriptor for the XSK map, an optional IPv4 address for filtering, and a list of UDP ports to filter. The function will terminate the process with an error message if the number of ports exceeds 16. The generated program will pass or redirect packets based on the specified criteria.
- **Inputs**:
    - `code_buf`: A buffer of 512 ulong elements where the generated eBPF code will be stored. The caller must ensure this buffer is properly allocated and has sufficient space.
    - `xsks_fd`: An integer representing the file descriptor for the XSK map. This is used in the eBPF program to redirect packets.
    - `listen_ip4_addr`: A uint representing the IPv4 address to filter destination addresses for, in network byte order. If zero, no IP address filtering is applied.
    - `ports`: A pointer to an array of ushort values representing the UDP ports to filter. The array must contain at most 16 ports, and the caller retains ownership of this array.
    - `ports_cnt`: An ulong indicating the number of ports in the 'ports' array. Must not exceed 16, otherwise the function will terminate the process with an error.
- **Output**: Returns the number of ulong elements written to the code_buf, representing the size of the generated eBPF program.

### fd\_xdp\_install<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_xdp_install}} -->
Installs a BPF program on a network interface to filter UDP traffic.
- **Description**: This function installs a BPF program on the specified network interface to filter and pass through UDP traffic on specified ports to an XSK map. It optionally filters traffic based on a specified IPv4 address. The function returns a structure containing file descriptors for the XSK map and the BPF link. The BPF link must remain open to keep the XDP program active. The function will terminate the process with an error message if it encounters a failure, ensuring that it does not return in such cases.
- **Inputs**:
    - `if_idx`: The index of the network interface on which to install the BPF program. Must be a valid interface index.
    - `listen_ip4_addr`: An IPv4 address in network byte order to filter destination addresses, or zero to disable address filtering.
    - `ports_cnt`: The number of ports in the 'ports' array. Must be greater than zero.
    - `ports`: An array of port numbers to filter UDP traffic. Must not be null and should contain valid port numbers.
    - `xdp_mode`: A string specifying the XDP mode, which can be 'skb', 'drv', 'hw', or 'generic'. Invalid modes will cause the function to terminate with an error.
- **Output**: Returns a structure containing file descriptors for the XSK map and the BPF link. The BPF link must remain open to keep the XDP program active.
- **See also**: [`fd_xdp_install`](fd_xdp1.c.driver.md#fd_xdp_install)  (Implementation)
