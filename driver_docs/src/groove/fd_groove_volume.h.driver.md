# Purpose
The provided C header file, `fd_groove_volume.h`, defines the structure and management functions for "groove volumes" within a software system. This file is part of a larger framework, likely dealing with data storage or memory management, as indicated by its inclusion of `fd_groove_base.h` and its references to memory mapping and data object storage. The primary purpose of this file is to define the structure of a `fd_groove_volume`, which is a data container with a fixed size footprint, and to provide mechanisms for managing these volumes in a lock-free manner. This includes adding and removing volumes from a pool, which allows for dynamic adjustment of storage capacity without interrupting ongoing operations.

The file defines several constants and a structure, `fd_groove_volume`, which includes metadata such as a magic number for validation, an index for mapping, and space for user information and data. The header also includes macros and function prototypes for managing a pool of these volumes, supporting operations like adding and removing volumes in a thread-safe manner. The design emphasizes efficient use of memory and compatibility with various storage technologies, from DRAM to NVMe/SSD, and supports large-scale data storage by leveraging 64-bit address spaces. The file is intended to be included in other C source files, providing a public API for managing groove volumes within the broader system.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `fd_groove_base.h`
- `../util/tmpl/fd_pool_para.c`


# Global Variables

---
### fd\_groove\_volume\_pool\_remove
- **Type**: `function pointer`
- **Description**: `fd_groove_volume_pool_remove` is a function that removes an empty volume from a groove volume pool and returns the location of the removed volume in the caller's address space. If no empty volumes are available, it returns NULL.
- **Use**: This function is used to dynamically manage the groove volume pool by removing and reclaiming empty volumes without blocking concurrent operations.


# Data Structures

---
### fd\_groove\_volume
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `magic`: Indicates if the volume potentially contains groove data allocations or not.
    - `idx`: Represents the volume index mapped into the user's address space.
    - `next`: Managed by the groove volume pool for internal tracking.
    - `info_sz`: Specifies the size of the user info in bytes, ranging from 0 to INFO_MAX.
    - `info`: Holds user information up to FD_GROOVE_VOLUME_INFO_MAX bytes, with arbitrary data beyond info_sz.
    - `data`: Contains the actual groove data up to FD_GROOVE_VOLUME_DATA_MAX bytes.
- **Description**: The `fd_groove_volume` structure is designed to manage groove data objects within a fixed-size volume, aligned to `FD_GROOVE_VOLUME_ALIGN`. It includes metadata such as a magic number to verify the presence of groove data, an index for mapping into user space, and a next pointer for pool management. The structure also contains a user-defined information section and a data section for storing the actual groove data, both of which are subject to specific size constraints. This design supports efficient memory management and dynamic volume allocation in a groove instance.


---
### fd\_groove\_volume\_t
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `magic`: Indicates the state of the volume, whether it contains groove data allocations or not.
    - `idx`: Represents the unique index of the volume in the user's address space.
    - `next`: Used by the groove volume pool for management purposes.
    - `info_sz`: Specifies the size of the user information stored in the volume.
    - `info`: Holds user information up to a maximum defined size, with arbitrary data beyond the specified size.
    - `data`: Contains the actual data stored in the volume, with a maximum size defined by the volume footprint.
- **Description**: The `fd_groove_volume_t` structure represents a groove volume, which is a data storage unit within a groove system. Each volume has a fixed footprint size and a unique index, allowing it to be mapped into a user's address space. The structure includes fields for managing the volume's state, index, and user information, as well as a data array for storing the actual groove data. The design supports dynamic management of volumes, allowing for efficient addition and removal without disrupting ongoing operations. The structure is aligned for optimal performance on 64-bit systems and can be backed by various storage technologies.


# Function Declarations (Public API)

---
### fd\_groove\_volume\_pool\_add<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_groove_volume_pool_add}} -->
Adds a memory region to the groove volume pool.
- **Description**: Use this function to add a specified memory region to a groove volume pool, marking it as empty and ready for future allocations. The function requires that the memory region is aligned and sized according to the groove volume footprint, and that it does not overlap with existing volumes in the pool. The volume information is initialized with the provided data, and any excess space is zeroed out. This function is thread-safe and non-blocking, making it suitable for concurrent use. It returns success or an error code if the operation fails due to invalid parameters or memory corruption.
- **Inputs**:
    - `pool`: A pointer to the groove volume pool where the memory region will be added. Must not be null and should be a valid local join.
    - `shmem`: A pointer to the start of the memory region to be added. Must be aligned and within the valid address space of the pool.
    - `footprint`: The size of the memory region in bytes. Must be a multiple of FD_GROOVE_VOLUME_FOOTPRINT and non-zero.
    - `info`: A pointer to the user-defined information to initialize the volume info. Can be null, in which case info_sz is treated as zero.
    - `info_sz`: The size of the user-defined information in bytes. Values greater than FD_GROOVE_VOLUME_INFO_MAX are clamped to FD_GROOVE_VOLUME_INFO_MAX.
- **Output**: Returns FD_GROOVE_SUCCESS on success, or a negative FD_GROOVE_ERR code on failure.

### fd\_groove\_volume\_pool\_remove<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_groove_volume_pool_remove}} -->
Removes an empty volume from the pool.
- **Description**: Use this function to remove an empty volume from the specified pool, transferring ownership of the volume to the caller. It is safe to call this function concurrently, and it will not block the caller or other concurrent pool users. The function returns the address of the removed volume in the caller's address space if successful. If the pool is empty or an error occurs, it returns NULL and logs a warning. Ensure the pool is properly initialized before calling this function.
- **Inputs**:
    - `pool`: A pointer to the fd_groove_volume_pool_t from which an empty volume is to be removed. Must not be null. If null, the function logs a warning and returns NULL.
- **Output**: Returns a pointer to the removed volume if successful, or NULL if no empty volumes are available or an error occurs.
- **See also**: [`fd_groove_volume_pool_remove`](fd_groove_volume.c.driver.md#fd_groove_volume_pool_remove)  (Implementation)
