# Purpose
This C source code file defines a statically initialized array of structures, `fd_groove_data_szc_cfg`, which contains configuration data for what appears to be a memory or data management system. The array consists of 32 elements, each of which is an instance of the `fd_groove_data_szc_cfg_t` structure. Each element in the array is initialized with specific values, including an unsigned integer and three unsigned characters, which likely represent configuration parameters such as size, limits, or thresholds. The comments next to each element provide additional context, indicating a "sb_footprint" value, which suggests the memory footprint or size associated with each configuration.

The file is likely part of a larger system, possibly related to memory allocation or data handling, where these configurations are used to manage resources efficiently. The inclusion of the header file "fd_groove_data.h" suggests that this file is part of a modular system where the structure `fd_groove_data_szc_cfg_t` is defined elsewhere, allowing for separation of concerns and reusability. This file does not define any public APIs or external interfaces directly; instead, it provides a specific set of configurations that can be utilized by other components of the system that include or link against this file.

### fd\_groove\_data\_szc\_cfg
- **Type**: `fd_groove_data_szc_cfg_t const[32]`
- **Description**: The `fd_groove_data_szc_cfg` is a constant array of 32 elements, each of type `fd_groove_data_szc_cfg_t`. This array is used to store configuration data for groove data size calculations, with each element containing four fields: an unsigned integer and three unsigned characters. The array is likely used to map specific configurations to their corresponding size and footprint values.
- **Use**: This variable is used to provide predefined configuration settings for groove data size calculations in the application.
