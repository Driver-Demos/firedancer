# Purpose
The provided content is from a Makefile, which is a build automation tool used to manage the build process of software projects. This particular Makefile snippet is designed to automate the compilation and testing of a library named `fd_groove`. It uses custom macros, such as `make-lib`, `add-hdrs`, and `add-objs`, to define the library and its associated header and object files. The file also specifies unit tests for different components of the library, such as `test_groove_base` and `test_groove_meta`, and includes conditional logic to run additional tests if the `FD_HAS_HOSTED` variable is defined. This setup ensures that the library is built correctly and that its components are thoroughly tested.
