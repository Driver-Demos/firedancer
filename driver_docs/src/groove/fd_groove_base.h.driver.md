# Purpose
This C header file, `fd_groove_base.h`, provides foundational definitions and utilities for managing "groove" data structures, which appear to be a part of a larger system. The file defines error codes, key management, and block alignment specifications, which are essential for the integrity and functionality of the groove system. The error codes, such as `FD_GROOVE_SUCCESS` and `FD_GROOVE_ERR_*`, standardize the way errors are reported and handled across the system, ensuring consistent error management. The [`fd_groove_strerror`](#fd_groove_strerror) function converts these error codes into human-readable strings, facilitating debugging and user feedback.

The file also defines a `fd_groove_key_t` type, which is a union used to represent keys for groove records. This type supports operations such as initialization, equality testing, and hashing, which are crucial for managing and accessing groove records efficiently. The keys are designed to be compact and can be initialized from binary data or individual `ulong` values. Additionally, the file specifies alignment and footprint requirements for groove data blocks, aligning them to 512 bytes, which is a common size for high-performance computing I/O operations. This alignment ensures compatibility with typical system and hardware constraints, optimizing performance. Overall, this header file provides a structured and efficient way to handle groove data structures, focusing on error management, key operations, and data alignment.

### fd\_groove\_key\_t
- **Type**: `union`
- **Members**:
    - `c`: An array of characters with a size defined by FD_GROOVE_KEY_FOOTPRINT.
    - `uc`: An array of unsigned characters with a size defined by FD_GROOVE_KEY_FOOTPRINT.
    - `ul`: An array of unsigned long integers with a size of FD_GROOVE_KEY_FOOTPRINT divided by the size of an unsigned long.
- **Description**: The `fd_groove_key_t` is a union data structure designed to represent a groove record key in a flexible manner, allowing it to store the key as either a character array, an unsigned character array, or an array of unsigned long integers. This design facilitates compact binary key representation while also supporting string-based keys, provided they adhere to specific size constraints. The union is aligned to an 8-byte boundary and has a footprint of 32 bytes, making it suitable for efficient memory operations and potential vectorization. The structure is used in various operations such as initialization, equality testing, and hashing, providing a versatile and efficient mechanism for key management in the groove system.


# Functions

---
### fd\_groove\_key\_init\_ulong<!-- {{#callable:fd_groove_key_init_ulong}} -->
The `fd_groove_key_init_ulong` function initializes a `fd_groove_key_t` structure with four unsigned long values.
- **Inputs**:
    - `k`: A pointer to a `fd_groove_key_t` structure where the key will be initialized.
    - `k0`: An unsigned long value to be assigned to the first element of the key.
    - `k1`: An unsigned long value to be assigned to the second element of the key.
    - `k2`: An unsigned long value to be assigned to the third element of the key.
    - `k3`: An unsigned long value to be assigned to the fourth element of the key.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Assigns the value of `k0` to the first element of the `ul` array in the `fd_groove_key_t` structure pointed to by `k`.
    - Assigns the value of `k1` to the second element of the `ul` array in the `fd_groove_key_t` structure pointed to by `k`.
    - Assigns the value of `k2` to the third element of the `ul` array in the `fd_groove_key_t` structure pointed to by `k`.
    - Assigns the value of `k3` to the fourth element of the `ul` array in the `fd_groove_key_t` structure pointed to by `k`.
- **Output**: Returns the pointer `k` to the initialized `fd_groove_key_t` structure.

### fd\_groove\_key\_eq<!-- {{#callable:fd_groove_key_eq}} -->
The `fd_groove_key_eq` function checks if two `fd_groove_key_t` keys are equal by comparing their underlying `ulong` arrays.
- **Inputs**:
    - `ka`: A pointer to the first `fd_groove_key_t` key to be compared.
    - `kb`: A pointer to the second `fd_groove_key_t` key to be compared.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Extracts the `ulong` arrays from both `ka` and `kb`.
    - Performs bitwise XOR operations between corresponding elements of the two arrays.
    - Combines the results using bitwise OR operations to determine if any differences exist.
    - Returns the negation of the final result, indicating equality if the result is zero.

### fd\_groove\_key\_hash<!-- {{#callable:fd_groove_key_hash}} -->
The `fd_groove_key_hash` function computes a quasi-random 64-bit hash for a given groove key using a specified seed.
- **Inputs**:
    - `ka`: A pointer to a `fd_groove_key_t` structure, which contains the key to be hashed.
    - `seed`: An unsigned long integer used as a seed to select the specific hash function.

- **Output**: Returns a 64-bit unsigned long integer representing the hash of the key.


# Function Declarations (Public API)

### fd\_groove\_strerror<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_groove_strerror}} -->
Convert an error code to a human-readable string.
- **Description**: Use this function to obtain a descriptive string for a given error code related to the fd_groove API. This is useful for logging or displaying error messages to users. The function accepts an error code and returns a constant string that describes the error. It handles a predefined set of error codes and returns "unknown" for any unrecognized codes. The returned string is always non-null and has an infinite lifetime, meaning it does not need to be freed or managed by the caller.
- **Inputs**:
    - `err`: An integer representing the error code to be converted. Valid values are predefined constants such as FD_GROOVE_SUCCESS, FD_GROOVE_ERR_INVAL, FD_GROOVE_ERR_AGAIN, FD_GROOVE_ERR_CORRUPT, FD_GROOVE_ERR_EMPTY, FD_GROOVE_ERR_FULL, and FD_GROOVE_ERR_KEY. Any other value will result in the return of "unknown".
- **Output**: A constant string describing the error code. The string is non-null and has an infinite lifetime.
