## Folders
- **[boot](shared/boot.driver.md)**: The `boot` folder in the `firedancer` codebase contains files responsible for initializing the boot process, managing configuration loading, and setting up logging for the application.
- **[commands](shared/commands.driver.md)**: The `commands` folder in the `firedancer` codebase contains various subfolders and files that implement command-line interfaces and functionalities for configuring, monitoring, running, and managing different aspects of the Firedancer application, including system configurations, key management, memory and network settings, readiness checks, identity management, and version information.

## Files
- **[fd_action.h](shared/fd_action.h.driver.md)**: The `fd_action.h` file defines a union `fdctl_args` for various command arguments and a struct `fd_action` for handling actions with associated metadata and function pointers in the Firedancer application.
- **[fd_config.c](shared/fd_config.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_config.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase is responsible for loading, validating, and processing configuration data for the application, including handling network settings, user information, and various operational parameters.
- **[fd_config.h](shared/fd_config.h.driver.md)**: The `fd_config.h` file in the `firedancer` codebase defines structures and functions for loading and managing configuration settings for the Firedancer application, including network, consensus, and logging configurations.
- **[fd_config_parse.c](shared/fd_config_parse.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_config_parse.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase is responsible for extracting and validating configuration settings from a given data structure, ensuring that paths and other parameters meet specified constraints, and handling renamed configuration options.
- **[fd_config_private.h](shared/fd_config_private.h.driver.md)**: The `fd_config_private.h` file in the `firedancer` codebase provides function prototypes for extracting, loading, transforming, and validating configuration data, with error handling that includes logging and process termination on failure.
- **[fd_obj_callbacks.c](shared/fd_obj_callbacks.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_obj_callbacks.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase defines a series of callback functions for various object types, such as `mcache`, `dcache`, `cnc`, `fseq`, `metrics`, `opaque`, `dbl_buf`, `neigh4_hmap`, `fib4`, `keyswitch`, and `tile`, each with specific implementations for footprint, alignment, and creation operations.
- **[fuzz_fdctl_config.c](shared/fuzz_fdctl_config.c.driver.md)**: The `fuzz_fdctl_config.c` file implements a fuzzing test for the `firedancer` application, focusing on parsing and extracting configuration data using TOML format.
- **[genesis_hash.h](shared/genesis_hash.h.driver.md)**: The `genesis_hash.h` file in the `firedancer` codebase provides a function to compute the shred version and genesis hash from a specified file using SHA-256 hashing.
- **[Local.mk](shared/Local.mk.driver.md)**: The `Local.mk` file in the `firedancer` codebase defines build rules and dependencies for the `fdctl_shared` library, including unit and fuzz tests, contingent on certain platform conditions.
- **[test_config_parse.c](shared/test_config_parse.c.driver.md)**: The `test_config_parse.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase tests the parsing and validation of configuration strings using the TOML format, ensuring correct handling of recognized and unrecognized keys, as well as the ability to override specific configuration fields.
