# Purpose
This C source code file contains the [`main`](#main) function, which serves as the entry point for a program. It includes a header file named "main.h" and calls the function `fd_dev_main`, passing along command-line arguments `argc` and `argv`, along with additional parameters: a zero, a constant character pointer to `fdctl_default_config`, the size of this configuration `fdctl_default_config_sz`, and a function pointer `fd_topo_initialize`. The purpose of this file is to initialize and execute a program using a default configuration and a specific initialization routine, likely related to some form of device or system topology setup.
# Imports and Dependencies

- `main.h`


# Functions

### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function serves as the entry point of the program, delegating execution to `fd_dev_main` with specific configuration parameters.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments passed to the program.
    - `argv`: An array of strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function calls `fd_dev_main`, passing `argc`, `argv`, a zero, a constant character pointer to `fdctl_default_config`, the size of `fdctl_default_config`, and `fd_topo_initialize` as arguments.
    - The function returns the result of the `fd_dev_main` function call.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer value which is the result of the `fd_dev_main` function call.
