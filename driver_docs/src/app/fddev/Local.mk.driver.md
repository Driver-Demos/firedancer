# Purpose
The provided content is a Makefile, which is a build automation tool used to manage the build process of a software project. This particular Makefile is designed to conditionally compile and link various components of a project based on the presence of specific features or environments, such as hosted environments, Linux, and certain hardware capabilities like SSE and 128-bit integers. It defines several targets, including `fddev`, `run`, and `monitor`, which are used to build and execute the main application and its associated components. The file uses conditional statements to check for specific configurations and dependencies, and it employs custom functions like `add-objs` and `make-bin-rust` to organize and compile the necessary object files and binaries. Additionally, it includes integration test targets to ensure the built software functions correctly.
