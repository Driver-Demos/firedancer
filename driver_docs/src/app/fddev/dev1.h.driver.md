# Purpose
This code is a simple C header file designed to declare an external variable and manage include dependencies. It uses include guards to prevent multiple inclusions, which is a common practice to avoid redefinition errors in C projects. The file includes another header, `fd_config.h`, from a shared directory, indicating that it relies on configurations or definitions provided there. The `extern` keyword declares `fd_action_dev1` as an external variable of type `action_t`, suggesting that its definition is located elsewhere, likely in a corresponding source file. This header is part of a modular codebase, facilitating the separation of declarations and definitions for better code organization and reusability.
# Imports and Dependencies

### fd\_action\_dev1
- **Type**: `action_t`
- **Description**: The variable `fd_action_dev1` is a global variable of type `action_t`, which is declared as an external variable. This suggests that its definition is located in another source file, and it is intended to be used across multiple files within the application.
- **Use**: This variable is used to represent or store an action related to device 1, allowing for shared access and manipulation across different parts of the program.
