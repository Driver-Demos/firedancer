# Purpose
This C source code file is designed to manage and execute a specific command, "dev1", which is part of a larger system involving tile-based operations. The file includes several headers that suggest it is part of a modular system, with functionalities related to system utilities, configuration, and command execution. The primary function of this file is to define and implement the "dev1" command, which involves parsing command-line arguments, configuring the system, and executing a specific tile operation. The code handles signal management, error logging, and resource cleanup, ensuring robust execution of the command.

The file defines a command structure, `fd_action_dev1`, which includes the command's name, argument parsing function, execution function, permission function, and a description. The [`dev1_cmd_fn`](#dev1_cmd_fn) function is central to the file, orchestrating the configuration update, signal installation, and execution of the specified tile operation. The code is structured to handle different tile names, with a specific case for "agave", and uses external functions and data structures to manage tile execution. This file is part of a larger system, likely a development or testing environment, where individual components or "tiles" can be configured and run independently.

### TILES
- **Type**: `fd_topo_run_tile_t *`
- **Description**: `TILES` is an array of pointers to `fd_topo_run_tile_t` structures, which are likely used to manage or execute specific tasks or operations related to tiles in a topology. Each element in the array represents a different tile runner, identified by its name.
- **Use**: `TILES` is used to find and execute the appropriate runner for a given tile name within the `dev1_cmd_fn` function.


---
### fd\_log\_private\_path
- **Type**: `char[1024]`
- **Description**: The `fd_log_private_path` is a global character array with a size of 1024, initialized as an empty string at the start. It is used to store the file path for logging purposes.
- **Use**: This variable is used to hold the path to the log file, which is referenced in logging operations, particularly when handling signals.


---
### fd\_log\_private\_shared\_lock
- **Type**: `int*`
- **Description**: The `fd_log_private_shared_lock` is a global pointer to an integer that is used as a lock mechanism for logging operations. It is declared as an external variable, indicating that its definition is expected to be found in another translation unit.
- **Use**: This variable is used to manage concurrent access to logging resources, ensuring that logging operations are synchronized across different parts of the program.


---
### fd\_action\_dev1
- **Type**: `action_t`
- **Description**: The `fd_action_dev1` variable is an instance of the `action_t` structure, which is used to define an action named 'dev1'. It includes function pointers for handling command arguments (`dev1_cmd_args`), executing the command (`dev1_cmd_fn`), and checking permissions (`dev_cmd_perm`). Additionally, it specifies that the action is part of a local cluster and provides a description of the action's purpose, which is to start up a single tile.
- **Use**: This variable is used to encapsulate the details and behavior of the 'dev1' action, allowing it to be executed with specific arguments, permissions, and functionality.


# Functions

---
### parent\_signal<!-- {{#callable:parent_signal}} -->
The `parent_signal` function handles received signals by logging the event and terminating the process with a specific exit code.
- **Inputs**:
    - `sig`: The signal number that the function is handling.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize a local integer variable `lock` to 0 and assign its address to `fd_log_private_shared_lock`.
    - Check if the log file descriptor is valid using `fd_log_private_logfile_fd()`.
    - If valid, log the received signal and the log file path using `FD_LOG_ERR_NOEXIT`.
    - If not valid, log only the received signal using `FD_LOG_ERR_NOEXIT`.
    - Check if the received signal is `SIGINT`.
    - If the signal is `SIGINT`, call `fd_sys_util_exit_group` with an exit code of `128 + SIGINT`.
    - If the signal is not `SIGINT`, call `fd_sys_util_exit_group` with an exit code of `0`.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it logs the signal and exits the process with a specific exit code.


---
### install\_parent\_signals<!-- {{#callable:install_parent_signals}} -->
The `install_parent_signals` function sets up signal handlers for SIGTERM and SIGINT to handle termination signals in a parent process.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - A `sigaction` structure `sa` is initialized with `parent_signal` as the handler and no flags.
    - The `sigaction` function is called to associate the `parent_signal` handler with the SIGTERM signal; if it fails, an error is logged.
    - The `sigaction` function is called again to associate the `parent_signal` handler with the SIGINT signal; if it fails, an error is logged.
- **Output**: The function does not return any value; it sets up signal handlers for the process.


---
### dev1\_cmd\_args<!-- {{#callable:dev1_cmd_args}} -->
The `dev1_cmd_args` function processes command-line arguments for the 'dev1' command, extracting the tile name and checking for the '--no-configure' option.
- **Inputs**:
    - `pargc`: A pointer to an integer representing the count of command-line arguments.
    - `pargv`: A pointer to an array of strings representing the command-line arguments.
    - `args`: A pointer to an `args_t` structure where parsed arguments will be stored.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if the number of arguments (`*pargc`) is less than 1; if so, log an error with usage information and terminate.
    - Copy the first argument from `*pargv` into `args->dev1.tile_name`, ensuring it fits within the buffer size.
    - Decrement the argument count (`*pargc`) and advance the argument pointer (`*pargv`) to the next argument.
    - Check if the '--no-configure' option is present in the remaining arguments using `fd_env_strip_cmdline_contains` and store the result in `args->dev1.no_configure`.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value but modifies the `args` structure to store the tile name and the presence of the '--no-configure' option.


---
### dev1\_cmd\_perm<!-- {{#callable:dev1_cmd_perm}} -->
The `dev1_cmd_perm` function delegates permission checking to the `dev_cmd_perm` function using the provided arguments.
- **Inputs**:
    - `args`: A pointer to an `args_t` structure containing command-line arguments and other relevant data for the command.
    - `chk`: A pointer to an `fd_cap_chk_t` structure used for capability checking.
    - `config`: A pointer to a constant `config_t` structure containing configuration settings.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function calls `dev_cmd_perm` with the same arguments it received (`args`, `chk`, and `config`).
- **Output**: The function does not return any value; it is a void function.


---
### dev1\_cmd\_fn<!-- {{#callable:dev1_cmd_fn}} -->
The `dev1_cmd_fn` function configures and initializes a development environment for a specified tile, handling signal installation and resource cleanup, and then executes the main function for the tile.
- **Inputs**:
    - `args`: A pointer to an `args_t` structure containing command-line arguments and configuration options for the development environment.
    - `config`: A pointer to a `config_t` structure containing configuration settings for the development environment, including topology and logging information.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if configuration is needed by evaluating `args->dev1.no_configure`; if not, initialize and execute the configuration command using `configure_cmd_fn`.
    - Call [`update_config_for_dev`](../shared_dev/commands/dev.c.driver.md#update_config_for_dev) to update the configuration settings for the development environment.
    - Initialize the Firedancer environment by calling `run_firedancer_init`.
    - Install signal handlers for `SIGTERM` and `SIGINT` using [`install_parent_signals`](#install_parent_signals).
    - Close file descriptors 0, 1, and the log lock file descriptor, logging errors if any close operation fails.
    - Determine the tile to run by comparing `args->dev1.tile_name` with "agave"; if it matches, call [`agave_main`](../fdctl/commands/run_agave.c.driver.md#agave_main).
    - If the tile name is not "agave", find the tile ID using `fd_topo_find_tile` and retrieve the corresponding tile and runner.
    - Execute the tile using `fd_topo_run_tile` with the retrieved runner and configuration settings.
    - Exit the process using `fd_sys_util_exit_group` with the result of the tile execution.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it exits the process using `fd_sys_util_exit_group` after executing the specified tile.

# Function Declarations (Public API)

---
### update\_config\_for\_dev<!-- {{#callable_declaration:update_config_for_dev}} -->
Updates the configuration for development environment.
- **Description**: This function is used to update the configuration settings for a development environment by setting the expected shred version for shred and store tiles. It should be called when the configuration needs to be adjusted based on the presence of a genesis file. The function assumes that the configuration structure is properly initialized and that the paths and topology information are correctly set. It modifies the configuration in place, particularly focusing on the shred version, which is computed from the genesis file if available.
- **Inputs**:
    - `config`: A pointer to an fd_config_t structure representing the configuration to be updated. The structure must be properly initialized, and the caller retains ownership. The function will modify this structure in place. If the shred version is unknown, it will be computed from the genesis file if it exists.
- **Output**: None
- **See also**: [`update_config_for_dev`](../shared_dev/commands/dev.c.driver.md#update_config_for_dev)  (Implementation)

### agave\_main<!-- {{#callable_declaration:agave_main}} -->
Boots the 'agave' tile with the provided configuration.
- **Description**: This function is used to initialize and boot the 'agave' tile using the provided configuration settings. It should be called when the 'agave' tile needs to be started, typically as part of a larger system initialization process. The function expects a valid configuration object, which includes settings for debugging, user and group IDs, and other necessary parameters. It handles the setup of the process environment, including signal handling and memory space configuration. The function assumes that the configuration object is correctly initialized and that the caller has the necessary permissions to perform the operations specified in the configuration.
- **Inputs**:
    - `args`: A pointer to a configuration object (config_t *) that contains the settings for booting the 'agave' tile. This must not be null and should be properly initialized before calling the function. The caller retains ownership of the configuration object.
- **Output**: Returns 0 on successful booting of the 'agave' tile. The function does not modify the input configuration object.
- **See also**: [`agave_main`](../fdctl/commands/run_agave.c.driver.md#agave_main)  (Implementation)
