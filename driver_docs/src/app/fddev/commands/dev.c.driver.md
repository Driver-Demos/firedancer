# Purpose
This C source code file is designed to facilitate the execution of a development validator within a multi-threaded environment. The primary functionality is encapsulated in the [`spawn_agave`](#spawn_agave) function, which creates a new thread using the POSIX `pthread` library. This thread executes the [`agave_main1`](#agave_main1) function, which in turn calls [`agave_boot`](#agave_boot), passing along a configuration object. The code ensures that the thread is named "fdSolMain" for easier identification and debugging. Error handling is implemented to log any issues that arise during thread creation or naming, using custom logging macros like `FD_LOG_ERR`.

The file also defines an action structure, `fd_action_dev`, which appears to be part of a larger command framework. This structure includes metadata such as the action's name, arguments, function pointer, permissions, and a description. The [`fddev_dev_cmd_fn`](#fddev_dev_cmd_fn) function acts as a bridge, linking command-line arguments and configuration data to the [`spawn_agave`](#spawn_agave) function. This setup suggests that the file is part of a broader system for managing development environments, likely within a distributed or clustered setup, given the `is_local_cluster` flag. The code is modular and intended to be integrated into a larger application, providing a specific utility for starting a development validator in a controlled, multi-threaded manner.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `../../shared_dev/commands/dev.h`
- `errno.h`
- `pthread.h`


# Global Variables

---
### fd\_action\_dev
- **Type**: `action_t`
- **Description**: The `fd_action_dev` is a global variable of type `action_t` that represents an action configuration for a development environment. It includes fields such as `name`, `args`, `fn`, `perm`, `is_local_cluster`, and `description`, which define the action's name, arguments, function to execute, permissions, whether it is local to a cluster, and a textual description, respectively.
- **Use**: This variable is used to configure and execute a specific action related to starting up a development validator in the system.


# Functions

---
### agave\_main1<!-- {{#callable:agave_main1}} -->
The `agave_main1` function serves as a thread entry point that calls the [`agave_boot`](../../fdctl/commands/run_agave.c.driver.md#agave_boot) function with the provided arguments and returns `NULL`.
- **Inputs**:
    - `args`: A pointer to the arguments passed to the thread, expected to be of type `config_t *`.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function `agave_main1` is defined as a static function, meaning it is limited to the file scope.
    - It takes a single argument `args`, which is a void pointer, allowing for flexibility in the type of data passed.
    - The function calls [`agave_boot`](../../fdctl/commands/run_agave.c.driver.md#agave_boot), passing `args` as its parameter, which is expected to be a configuration structure.
    - After calling [`agave_boot`](../../fdctl/commands/run_agave.c.driver.md#agave_boot), the function returns `NULL`, indicating no meaningful return value is provided.
- **Output**: The function returns `NULL`, indicating it does not produce a meaningful result.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`agave_boot`](../../fdctl/commands/run_agave.c.driver.md#agave_boot)


---
### spawn\_agave<!-- {{#callable:spawn_agave}} -->
The `spawn_agave` function creates a new thread to execute the `agave_main1` function with a given configuration and sets the thread's name to 'fdSolMain'.
- **Inputs**:
    - `config`: A pointer to a constant `config_t` structure that contains configuration data for the thread.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Declare a `pthread_t` variable to hold the thread identifier.
    - Attempt to create a new thread using `pthread_create`, passing the thread identifier, default thread attributes, the `agave_main1` function as the start routine, and the `config` pointer as an argument.
    - If `pthread_create` fails, log an error message with the error number and description.
    - Attempt to set the name of the created thread to 'fdSolMain' using `pthread_setname_np`.
    - If `pthread_setname_np` fails, log an error message with the error number and description.
- **Output**: The function does not return any value; it either successfully creates and names a thread or logs an error if it fails.


---
### fddev\_dev\_cmd\_fn<!-- {{#callable:fddev_dev_cmd_fn}} -->
The `fddev_dev_cmd_fn` function executes a device command function with specified arguments and configuration, using `spawn_agave` as the command execution function.
- **Inputs**:
    - `args`: A pointer to an `args_t` structure containing the arguments for the device command function.
    - `config`: A pointer to a `config_t` structure containing the configuration settings for the device command function.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function calls `dev_cmd_fn`, passing `args`, `config`, and `spawn_agave` as arguments.
    - The `spawn_agave` function is used as the command execution function within `dev_cmd_fn`.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it performs its operations by invoking `dev_cmd_fn` with the provided arguments and configuration.


# Function Declarations (Public API)

---
### agave\_boot<!-- {{#callable_declaration:agave_boot}} -->
Boots the Agave validator with the specified configuration.
- **Description**: This function initializes and starts the Agave validator using the provided configuration settings. It constructs command-line arguments based on the configuration and sets up the environment for the validator to run. This function should be called when you need to start the Agave validator with specific settings defined in a `config_t` structure. Ensure that the configuration is fully populated with valid data before calling this function, as it does not perform extensive validation on the input.
- **Inputs**:
    - `config`: A pointer to a `config_t` structure containing the configuration settings for the Agave validator. The structure must be fully populated with valid data, and the pointer must not be null. The function does not modify the configuration data.
- **Output**: None
- **See also**: [`agave_boot`](../../fdctl/commands/run_agave.c.driver.md#agave_boot)  (Implementation)
