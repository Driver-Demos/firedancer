# Purpose
This C source code file is part of a larger system that manages the initialization and configuration of a blockstore, specifically for a blockchain or distributed ledger system. The primary functionality of this file is to ensure that a genesis block (block 0) is created and stored in a directory structure that is compatible with RocksDB, a high-performance database. The code is structured around three main functions: [`init`](#init), [`fini`](#fini), and [`check`](#check), which are responsible for initializing the blockstore, cleaning up resources, and verifying the configuration state, respectively. The [`init`](#init) function is particularly crucial as it constructs the initial block by generating and appending proof-of-history (PoH) hashes, creating data and parity shreds, and then forking a process to insert these shreds into the blockstore. This process is necessary to avoid multi-threading issues with RocksDB that could interfere with sandboxing.

The file includes several external dependencies and utilizes various utility functions for file and system operations, indicating its integration into a broader software ecosystem. It defines a public API through the [`fd_ext_blockstore_create_block0`](#fd_ext_blockstore_create_block0) function, which is used to create the initial block in the blockstore. The code also handles user permissions and directory management to ensure that the genesis block is correctly set up and accessible. The [`check`](#check) function verifies the existence and configuration of the blockstore, ensuring that the necessary directories and files are present and correctly permissioned. Overall, this file provides a focused and essential service within a blockchain system, ensuring that the foundational data structure is correctly initialized and maintained.

# Global Variables

---
### fd\_cfg\_stage\_blockstore
- **Type**: `configure_stage_t`
- **Description**: The `fd_cfg_stage_blockstore` is a global variable of type `configure_stage_t` that represents a configuration stage for managing a blockstore in a ledger system. It is initialized with specific function pointers for initialization (`init`), finalization (`fini`), and checking (`check`) operations, as well as a name and a flag indicating whether the blockstore should always be recreated.
- **Use**: This variable is used to define and manage the lifecycle of a blockstore configuration stage, including its creation, cleanup, and validation processes.


# Functions

---
### zero\_signer<!-- {{#callable:zero_signer}} -->
The `zero_signer` function sets a 64-byte signature buffer to zero.
- **Inputs**:
    - `_1`: A void pointer, which is not used in the function.
    - `sig`: A pointer to an unsigned char array where the signature is stored, which will be zeroed out.
    - `_2`: A constant pointer to an unsigned char, which is not used in the function.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function begins by casting the unused parameters `_1` and `_2` to void to suppress compiler warnings about unused variables.
    - The `memset` function is called to set the memory area pointed to by `sig` to zero, for a total of 64 bytes.
- **Output**: The function does not return any value; it modifies the memory pointed to by `sig`.


---
### init<!-- {{#callable:init}} -->
The `init` function initializes the blockstore by creating a genesis block in the ledger directory, ensuring the Agave validator can boot.
- **Inputs**:
    - `config`: A pointer to a `config_t` structure containing configuration details such as paths and genesis parameters.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Retrieve `ticks_per_slot` and `hashes_per_tick` from the configuration.
    - Construct the path to `genesis.bin` and compute its hash and shred version.
    - Define a batch structure to hold ticks and initialize it with the number of ticks per slot.
    - Iterate over each tick, appending hashes and updating the batch structure with hash details.
    - Calculate the batch size and verify it against shred limits.
    - Initialize data and parity shreds, setting up a forward error correction (FEC) set.
    - Create and join a shredder, initializing it with the batch and FEC set.
    - Fork a new process to handle the creation of the genesis block in the blockstore.
    - In the child process, switch user permissions, set file creation mask, and create the block0 using `fd_ext_blockstore_create_block0`.
    - Exit the child process after block creation.
    - In the parent process, wait for the child process to complete and handle any errors or signals.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it performs initialization tasks and handles errors internally.


---
### fini<!-- {{#callable:fini}} -->
The `fini` function cleans up a specified directory by removing all files and directories except for 'genesis.bin'.
- **Inputs**:
    - `config`: A pointer to a `config_t` structure containing configuration details, specifically the path to the ledger directory.
    - `pre_init`: An integer parameter that is unused in this function.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Open the directory specified by `config->paths.ledger` using `opendir`.
    - If the directory cannot be opened and the error is `ENOENT`, return immediately; otherwise, log an error and exit.
    - Iterate over each entry in the directory using `readdir`.
    - Skip entries named '.' and '..', as well as 'genesis.bin'.
    - For each remaining entry, construct its full path and use `lstat` to get its status.
    - If `lstat` fails and the error is `ENOENT`, continue to the next entry; otherwise, log an error and exit.
    - If the entry is a directory, attempt to remove it using `fd_file_util_rmtree`; log an error and exit if this fails.
    - If the entry is a file, attempt to unlink it; log an error and exit if this fails and the error is not `ENOENT`.
    - After processing all entries, check for errors from `readdir` and log an error if any occurred.
    - Close the directory using `closedir` and log an error if this fails.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it performs cleanup operations and logs errors if any issues occur.


---
### check<!-- {{#callable:check}} -->
The `check` function verifies the existence and configuration of a 'rocksdb' directory within a specified ledger directory, returning a configuration result based on its findings.
- **Inputs**:
    - `config`: A pointer to a constant `config_t` structure containing configuration details, including the path to the ledger directory and user/group IDs.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize a flag `has_non_genesis` to 0 to track if non-genesis files are found.
    - Attempt to open the directory specified by `config->paths.ledger` using `opendir`.
    - If the directory cannot be opened and the error is `ENOENT`, log that the ledger directory does not exist and return a 'not configured' status.
    - Iterate over the directory entries using `readdir`.
    - Skip entries named '.' and '..'.
    - If an entry named 'genesis.bin' is found, continue to the next entry.
    - If an entry named 'rocksdb' is found, construct its path and call `check_dir` to verify its configuration.
    - If `check_dir` returns a non-OK result, close the directory and return the result.
    - Set `has_non_genesis` to 1 if any non-genesis entry is found and break the loop.
    - After the loop, check for errors from `readdir` and log if any occurred.
    - Close the directory using `closedir`.
    - If `has_non_genesis` is true, log that the 'rocksdb' directory exists and return a 'partially configured' status.
    - If `has_non_genesis` is false, log that the 'rocksdb' directory does not exist and return a 'not configured' status.
- **Output**: The function returns a `configure_result_t` indicating the configuration status of the ledger directory, specifically whether the 'rocksdb' directory is present and correctly configured.
