# Purpose
The file contains the single entry "venv," which is typically used in a `.gitignore` file to specify that the directory named "venv" should be ignored by version control systems like Git. This is commonly used to exclude virtual environment directories from being tracked, as they contain environment-specific dependencies that are not necessary to include in the repository.
