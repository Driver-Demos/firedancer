# Purpose
This code is a C header file that declares a function and an external variable related to a command execution framework. The function [`run_agave_cmd_fn`](#run_agave_cmd_fn) is declared to take two parameters, `args_t * args` and `config_t * config`, suggesting it is designed to execute a command with specific arguments and configuration settings. Additionally, the file declares an external variable `fd_action_run_agave` of type `action_t`, which likely represents an action or command that can be executed within the framework. The use of include guards ensures that the header file's contents are only included once in a compilation unit, preventing redefinition errors. Overall, this header file is part of a larger application, likely dealing with command execution or management.
