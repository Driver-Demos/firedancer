# Purpose
This C source code file is part of a larger software system, likely related to network or system configuration and management, as indicated by the inclusion of headers such as "topology.h" and "configure.h". The file defines several arrays of pointers to callback functions, configuration stages, and operational tiles, which are likely used to manage and execute various tasks within the system. The `CALLBACKS`, `STAGES`, `TILES`, and `ACTIONS` arrays organize these components, suggesting a modular architecture where different functionalities can be dynamically managed or executed based on the system's needs.

The file also contains a [`main`](#main) function, indicating that it is an executable component of the software. The [`main`](#main) function calls `fd_main`, passing command-line arguments and configuration data, which suggests that this file serves as an entry point for executing the application named "Frankendancer" with the binary name "fdctl". Additionally, there is a function [`add_bench_topo`](#add_bench_topo), which appears to be a placeholder or utility function for adding benchmarking topology configurations, although it currently does not perform any operations. This function's presence suggests that the file may also be used in development or testing scenarios to simulate or monitor system performance.
