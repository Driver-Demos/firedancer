# Purpose
This code is a C header file that serves as an interface for accessing default configuration data for an application component named `fdctl`. It includes a utility header file, `fd_util.h`, which suggests that it might rely on some utility functions or definitions provided there. The file declares two external variables: `fdctl_default_config`, a constant array of unsigned characters, and `fdctl_default_config_sz`, a constant unsigned long, which likely represent the default configuration data and its size, respectively. The use of include guards ensures that the header's contents are only included once per compilation unit, preventing potential redefinition errors.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `../../util/fd_util.h`


# Global Variables

---
### fdctl\_default\_config
- **Type**: `uchar const[]`
- **Description**: The `fdctl_default_config` is a global constant array of unsigned characters, which likely represents a default configuration for the fdctl application. This array is declared as an external variable, indicating that its definition is located in another source file.
- **Use**: This variable is used to provide a default configuration setting for the fdctl application, accessible throughout the program.


---
### fdctl\_default\_config\_sz
- **Type**: `ulong`
- **Description**: The variable `fdctl_default_config_sz` is a global constant of type `ulong` that represents the size of the default configuration array `fdctl_default_config`. It is declared as an external variable, indicating that its definition is located in another source file.
- **Use**: This variable is used to determine the size of the default configuration data for the application, likely for purposes such as memory allocation or iteration.
