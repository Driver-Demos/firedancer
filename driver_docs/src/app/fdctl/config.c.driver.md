# Purpose
This code is a C source file that imports a binary configuration file using a macro from an included utility header, `fd_util.h`. The `FD_IMPORT_BINARY` macro is used to embed the contents of a TOML configuration file, `default.toml`, located in the `src/app/fdctl/config/` directory, into the binary at compile time. This approach allows the application to access default configuration settings directly from the binary, eliminating the need to read the configuration from an external file at runtime. The inclusion of `fd_util.h` suggests that this file is part of a larger project that utilizes utility functions or macros defined in that header.
