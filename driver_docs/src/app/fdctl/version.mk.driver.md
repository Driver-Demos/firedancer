# Purpose
This file defines versioning information for a software project using three variables: `VERSION_MAJOR`, `VERSION_MINOR`, and `VERSION_PATCH`. These variables indicate the major, minor, and patch levels of the software version, respectively, and are set to 0, 1, and 1, suggesting an early development stage.
