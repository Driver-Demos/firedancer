# Purpose
The provided configuration file is designed for benchmarking software performance on a Zen3 CPU, specifically targeting systems like the AMD EPYC 7513. It outlines a setup that assumes a CPU architecture with 64 logical cores and 32 physical cores, detailing how threads are mapped to these cores. The configuration includes sections for ledger management, core affinity settings, and development parameters, such as initial account funding and tile counts for various operations. It also specifies settings for RPC (Remote Procedure Call) behavior, such as transaction history and metadata storage, and defines limits for pending shred sets, which are likely related to data processing or transaction handling. This configuration is tailored for testing and benchmarking purposes rather than production use, as it dedicates specific resources to simulate transaction generation and processing.
