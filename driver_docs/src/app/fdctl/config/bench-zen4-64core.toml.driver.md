# Purpose
This configuration file is designed for benchmarking software performance on an AMD Zen4 CPU, specifically tailored for a high-performance processor like the AMD EPYC 9554P, which features 64 physical cores and 128 logical cores. The file specifies various settings across different sections, such as layout, development, RPC, and tiles, to optimize the benchmarking process. The `[layout]` section defines parameters for tile verification and distribution, while `[development.genesis]` and `[development.bench]` sections configure initial account funding, hash processing, and benchmarking tile counts, along with enabling or disabling certain features to test performance limits. The `[rpc]` section manages transaction history and metadata storage settings, and the `[tiles]` sections control GUI enablement and resource consumption settings. Overall, this file is crucial for setting up a controlled environment to measure and analyze the performance characteristics of the software on the specified hardware.
