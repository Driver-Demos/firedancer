# Purpose
This C source code file is a configuration and versioning module for a software project. It defines and initializes constants related to the versioning of the software, such as major, minor, and patch version numbers, as well as commit reference identifiers. The file includes headers for utility functions and version definitions, and it uses preprocessor directives to set default values for patch version and commit references if they are not already defined. The constants are used to store version information in both numeric and string formats, which can be utilized elsewhere in the project for version tracking and display purposes. This setup is typical for maintaining consistent version information across a software application.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `../../util/fd_util.h`
- `version.h`


# Global Variables

---
### fdctl\_major\_version
- **Type**: `ulong`
- **Description**: The `fdctl_major_version` is a global constant variable of type `ulong` that holds the major version number of the software. It is initialized with the value of the macro `FDCTL_MAJOR_VERSION`, which is expected to be defined elsewhere in the codebase, likely in the included "version.h" file.
- **Use**: This variable is used to represent and access the major version number of the software throughout the program.


---
### fdctl\_minor\_version
- **Type**: `ulong`
- **Description**: The `fdctl_minor_version` is a global constant variable of type `ulong` that holds the minor version number of the software. It is defined using a preprocessor macro `FDCTL_MINOR_VERSION`, which is expected to be set elsewhere in the code or build system.
- **Use**: This variable is used to track and represent the minor version component of the software's versioning scheme.


---
### fdctl\_patch\_version
- **Type**: `ulong`
- **Description**: The `fdctl_patch_version` is a global constant variable of type `ulong` that holds the patch version number of the software. It is defined using the preprocessor macro `FDCTL_PATCH_VERSION`, which defaults to 9999 if not previously defined.
- **Use**: This variable is used to track and represent the patch version of the software, allowing for version control and identification.


---
### fdctl\_commit\_ref
- **Type**: `uint`
- **Description**: The `fdctl_commit_ref` is a global constant variable of type `uint` that holds a 32-bit unsigned integer representing the commit reference for the software version control. It is initialized with the value defined by the macro `FDCTL_COMMIT_REF_U32`, which defaults to `0x0` if not otherwise specified.
- **Use**: This variable is used to store and provide a numeric representation of the commit reference for version tracking purposes.


---
### fdctl\_commit\_ref\_string
- **Type**: ``char const[]``
- **Description**: The `fdctl_commit_ref_string` is a global constant character array that holds the commit reference string for the software. It is defined using the macro `FDCTL_COMMIT_REF_CSTR`, which defaults to a string of 40 zeros if not otherwise specified. This variable is used to identify the specific commit of the source code from which the software was built.
- **Use**: This variable is used to store and provide the commit reference string for version tracking and identification purposes.


---
### fdctl\_version\_string
- **Type**: `char const[]`
- **Description**: The `fdctl_version_string` is a constant character array that holds the version string of the software, formatted as 'major.minor.patch'. It is constructed using macros that expand to the major, minor, and patch version numbers of the software.
- **Use**: This variable is used to provide a human-readable version string for the software, which can be displayed in logs or user interfaces.
