# Purpose
This C source code file implements a simple HTTP server that processes JSON-RPC requests, specifically designed to handle two types of requests: "getLatestBlockhash" and "getTransactionCount". The server listens on a specified IP address and port, accepts incoming connections, and parses HTTP requests using the `picohttpparser` library. It checks for the correct HTTP method and headers, particularly ensuring that the request is a POST with a JSON content type. Upon receiving a valid request, it parses the JSON payload using the `cJSON` library and generates a corresponding JSON-RPC response. The server then sends this response back to the client over the network.

The file also contains a [`main`](#main) function that serves as a test harness for the RPC client functionality. It initializes the RPC client, spawns a thread to run the server, and performs a series of tests to verify the client's ability to request transaction counts and the latest block hash. The tests ensure that the client can successfully communicate with the server, receive the expected responses, and handle the data correctly. The code is structured to ensure proper resource management, including socket handling and thread synchronization, and it uses assertions to validate the correctness of operations throughout the process.

# Global Variables

---
### listening
- **Type**: `volatile int`
- **Description**: The `listening` variable is a global volatile integer that indicates whether the server is currently listening for incoming connections. It is used to signal the main thread when the server is ready to accept connections.
- **Use**: The `listening` variable is set to 1 when the server starts listening and is checked in a loop in the main function to synchronize server readiness.


# Functions

---
### fd\_rpc\_serve\_one<!-- {{#callable:fd_rpc_serve_one}} -->
The `fd_rpc_serve_one` function sets up a server to handle a single RPC request over HTTP, processes the request, and sends back a JSON response based on the requested method.
- **Inputs**:
    - `args`: A void pointer to arguments, which is not used in this function.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize a socket for IPv4 TCP communication and set socket options to allow address reuse.
    - Bind the socket to the local address 127.0.0.1 on port 12001 and start listening for incoming connections.
    - Accept a connection from a client and enter a loop to receive data into a buffer until a complete HTTP request is received.
    - Parse the HTTP request to extract the method, path, headers, and content length, ensuring it is a POST request with JSON content.
    - Parse the JSON content to determine the requested RPC method and prepare a JSON response based on the method ('getLatestBlockhash' or 'getTransactionCount').
    - Format the HTTP response with the JSON content and send it back to the client.
    - Close the client connection and the listening socket.
- **Output**: The function returns a NULL pointer after processing the request and sending the response.


---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function initializes and tests an RPC client by performing a series of operations including alignment checks, creating and joining an RPC client, making requests for transaction count and latest block hash, and finally cleaning up resources.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments passed to the program.
    - `argv`: An array of strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize the program with `fd_boot` using command-line arguments.
    - Log a notice about testing alignment and footprint of the RPC client.
    - Check the alignment and footprint of the RPC client using `FD_TEST`.
    - Log a notice about testing the creation of a new RPC client.
    - Create a new RPC client with [`fd_rpc_client_new`](fd_rpc_client.c.driver.md#fd_rpc_client_new) and verify its success.
    - Log a notice about testing the joining of the RPC client.
    - Join the RPC client with [`fd_rpc_client_join`](fd_rpc_client.h.driver.md#fd_rpc_client_join) and verify its success.
    - Log a notice about testing the request for transaction count.
    - Set `listening` to 0 and create a new thread to serve one RPC request.
    - Wait until the server is listening.
    - Request the transaction count using [`fd_rpc_client_request_transaction_count`](fd_rpc_client.c.driver.md#fd_rpc_client_request_transaction_count) and verify the request ID is valid.
    - Check the status of the request and verify the response is successful and the transaction count is 268.
    - Close the RPC client request and join the thread.
    - Log a notice about testing the request for the latest block hash.
    - Set `listening` to 0 and create a new thread to serve one RPC request.
    - Wait until the server is listening.
    - Request the latest block hash using [`fd_rpc_client_request_latest_block_hash`](fd_rpc_client.c.driver.md#fd_rpc_client_request_latest_block_hash) and verify the request ID is valid.
    - Check the status of the request and verify the response is successful and the block hash matches the expected value.
    - Close the RPC client request and join the thread.
    - Log a notice about testing the leave operation of the RPC client.
    - Leave the RPC client with [`fd_rpc_client_leave`](fd_rpc_client.h.driver.md#fd_rpc_client_leave) and verify it returns the original shared RPC client pointer.
    - Log a notice about testing the deletion of the RPC client.
    - Delete the RPC client with [`fd_rpc_client_delete`](fd_rpc_client.h.driver.md#fd_rpc_client_delete) and verify it returns the original RPC client pointer.
    - Log a notice indicating the tests passed and halt the program.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer value of 0, indicating successful execution.
