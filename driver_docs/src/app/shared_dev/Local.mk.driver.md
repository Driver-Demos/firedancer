# Purpose
The provided content is from a Makefile, which is a build automation tool used to manage the build process of software projects. This particular Makefile snippet is conditional, executing only if the macros `FD_HAS_HOSTED`, `FD_HAS_LINUX`, and `FD_HAS_SSE` are defined, indicating that the build is intended for a hosted environment on a Linux system with SSE (Streaming SIMD Extensions) support. The file uses a custom function `make-lib` to create a shared library named `fddev_shared`, and then adds various object files to this library using the `add-objs` function. These object files are organized into categories such as boot, actions, tiles, and configure stages, each corresponding to different functionalities or components of the software, like benchmarking, packet generation, and configuration management. This structure helps in modularizing the build process, ensuring that only the necessary components are compiled and linked based on the specified conditions.
