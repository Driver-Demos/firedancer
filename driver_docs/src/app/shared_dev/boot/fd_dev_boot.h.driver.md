# Purpose
This code is a C header file that defines an interface for a function, [`fd_dev_main`](#fd_dev_main), which appears to be part of a larger application framework. The header file includes other configuration and utility headers, suggesting that it is part of a modular system where different components are integrated. The [`fd_dev_main`](#fd_dev_main) function is designed to initialize a device or application environment, taking parameters such as command-line arguments, a flag indicating if it is a "firedancer" instance, a default configuration, and a function pointer for topology initialization. The use of include guards ensures that the header is only included once, preventing redefinition errors during compilation.

# Function Declarations (Public API)

### fd\_dev\_main<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_dev_main}} -->
Execute a specified command in a development environment.
- **Description**: This function is used to execute a command within a development environment, handling command-line arguments and configuration settings. It should be called with the appropriate arguments and configuration data when setting up a development or test environment. The function processes command-line arguments to determine the action to perform, checks permissions, and executes the specified command. It is important to ensure that the arguments and configuration are correctly set up to avoid errors, especially when dealing with live clusters or insufficient permissions.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments passed to the function. It must be a non-negative integer and should not exceed a predefined maximum limit. If the limit is exceeded, an error is logged.
    - `_argv`: An array of strings representing the command-line arguments. The array must not be null, and the first element should be the program name. The function modifies this array as it processes the arguments.
    - `is_firedancer`: An integer flag indicating whether the Firedancer environment is being used. It should be either 0 or 1.
    - `default_config`: A pointer to a constant character array representing the default configuration. It must not be null and should point to a valid configuration string.
    - `default_config_sz`: The size of the default configuration string in bytes. It must be a positive integer.
    - `topo_init`: A pointer to a function that initializes the topology configuration. This function takes a pointer to a config_t structure as its argument. The pointer must not be null.
- **Output**: Returns 0 upon successful execution of the command.
