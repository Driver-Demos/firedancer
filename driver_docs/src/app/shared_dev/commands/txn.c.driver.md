# Purpose
This C source code file is designed to facilitate the sending of transactions over a QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections) protocol to a specified endpoint. The file is structured to define a command (`txn`) that can be executed to send a specified number of transactions, either using a hardcoded sample payload or a user-provided base64-encoded payload. The code includes functions to parse command-line arguments, check necessary permissions, and manage the lifecycle of a QUIC connection, including initialization, connection establishment, data transmission, and cleanup. The file imports several headers and libraries that provide utilities for network operations, QUIC protocol handling, and base64 encoding/decoding, indicating its reliance on external components for these functionalities.

The core functionality revolves around the [`send_quic_transactions`](#send_quic_transactions) function, which manages the connection to a QUIC server, sends the specified transactions, and handles connection events through callback functions. The code is structured to be part of a larger application, as indicated by its inclusion of shared configuration and action headers, and it defines an action (`fd_action_txn`) that can be registered and executed within this broader context. This action is described as sending a transaction to an "fddev" instance, suggesting its use in a specific application or testing environment where transactions need to be sent to a development or testing server. The file is not a standalone executable but rather a component intended to be integrated into a larger system, providing a specific functionality related to transaction handling over QUIC.

### txn\_cmd\_perm
- **Type**: `function`
- **Description**: The `txn_cmd_perm` function is a global function that checks permissions related to network namespace operations. It takes three parameters: `args`, `chk`, and `config`.

- **Description**: The `fd_action_txn` is a global variable of type `action_t` that represents an action to send a transaction to an fddev instance. It is initialized with specific function pointers and parameters that define its behavior, including argument parsing, permission checking, and the main function to execute the transaction sending process.
- **Use**: This variable is used to encapsulate the logic and parameters required to send a transaction to an fddev instance, facilitating the execution of this action within the application.


# Functions

---
### txn\_cmd\_args<!-- {{#callable:txn_cmd_args}} -->
The `txn_cmd_args` function parses command-line arguments to configure transaction parameters such as payload, count, destination IP, and port for a transaction command.
- **Inputs**:
    - `pargc`: A pointer to an integer representing the count of command-line arguments.
    - `pargv`: A pointer to an array of strings representing the command-line arguments.
    - `args`: A pointer to an `args_t` structure where parsed transaction parameters will be stored.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function uses `fd_env_strip_cmdline_cstr` to extract the `--payload-base64-encoded` argument from the command line and assigns it to `args->txn.payload_base64`.
    - It extracts the `--count` argument using `fd_env_strip_cmdline_ulong`, with a default value of 1, and assigns it to `args->txn.count`.
    - A check is performed to ensure `args->txn.count` is between 1 and `MAX_TXN_COUNT`; if not, an error is logged and the program exits.
    - The function extracts the `--dst-ip` argument using `fd_env_strip_cmdline_cstr` and assigns it to `args->txn.dst_ip`.
    - It extracts the `--dst-port` argument using `fd_env_strip_cmdline_ushort` and assigns it to `args->txn.dst_port`.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it modifies the `args` structure in place to store the parsed transaction parameters.
