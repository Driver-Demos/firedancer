# Purpose
The provided C source code file is designed to handle the tracing and parsing of QUIC protocol frames. It is part of a larger system, likely a QUIC implementation, as indicated by the inclusion of headers and source files from a "waltz/quic" directory. The file defines a series of functions that process different types of QUIC frames, such as padding, ping, ack, crypto, and various stream frames. Each function is responsible for decoding a specific frame type, extracting relevant information, and performing actions like logging or returning the size of the processed data. The code also includes several "FRAME_STUB" macros, which define placeholder functions for frame types that are not fully implemented, returning a default value of zero.

The file is structured to provide a modular approach to frame processing, with each frame type having a dedicated function. This modularity is achieved through the use of macros and function templates, which streamline the creation of similar functions for different frame types. The code also includes error handling mechanisms, such as checking for parsing failures and logging errors when frames cannot be processed. The primary purpose of this file is to facilitate the tracing of QUIC frames, which is crucial for debugging and monitoring QUIC connections. The functions defined here are likely intended to be used internally within a larger QUIC library or application, as they do not define public APIs or external interfaces.

- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize `pad_sz` to 0.
    - Iterate over the buffer `p` while `pad_sz` is less than `p_sz` and the current byte is zero.
    - Increment the pointer `p` and the counter `pad_sz` for each zero byte encountered.
    - Exit the loop when a non-zero byte is found or the end of the buffer is reached.

### fd\_quic\_trace\_frames<!-- {{#callable:fd_quic_trace_frames}} -->
The `fd_quic_trace_frames` function processes a sequence of QUIC frames from a data buffer, updating the context and reducing the buffer size as frames are successfully parsed.
- **Inputs**:
    - `context`: A pointer to an `fd_quic_trace_frame_ctx_t` structure that holds the context for tracing QUIC frames.
    - `data`: A pointer to a buffer of unsigned characters representing the data containing QUIC frames to be traced.
    - `data_sz`: An unsigned long integer representing the size of the data buffer in bytes.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function enters a while loop that continues as long as `data_sz` is non-zero.
    - Within the loop, it calls [`fd_quic_trace_frame`](#fd_quic_trace_frame) with the current context, data, and data size.
    - If [`fd_quic_trace_frame`](#fd_quic_trace_frame) returns `FD_QUIC_PARSE_FAIL`, the function exits immediately, indicating a parsing failure.
    - If the return value `ret` is greater than `data_sz`, the function exits, indicating an error in parsing or data size mismatch.
    - If parsing is successful, the data pointer is incremented by `ret` and `data_sz` is decremented by `ret`, effectively moving to the next frame in the buffer.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it modifies the input context and data buffer in place.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`fd_quic_trace_frame`](#fd_quic_trace_frame)
