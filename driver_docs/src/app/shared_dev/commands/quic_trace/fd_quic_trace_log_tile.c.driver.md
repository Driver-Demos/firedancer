# Purpose
This C source code file is designed to handle the tracing and logging of QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections) events, specifically focusing on connection closure events. The file includes several static functions ([`before_frag`](#before_frag), [`during_frag`](#during_frag), and [`after_frag`](#after_frag)) that are used as callbacks during the processing of fragments in a QUIC connection. These functions are responsible for logging specific events, copying data into a buffer, and printing detailed information about connection closure events, such as connection ID, source IP, encryption level, packet number, and error codes. The code leverages a logging utility (`fd_quic_log_sig_event`) to determine if a QUIC connection close event has occurred and uses formatted output to display relevant information.

The file also integrates with a larger framework by including and utilizing components from other modules, such as `fd_stem.c`, which appears to be part of a broader system for handling data streams or fragments. The [`fd_quic_trace_log_tile`](#fd_quic_trace_log_tile) function sets up the necessary environment for processing these fragments, including initializing random number generation and memory alignment for data structures. This function orchestrates the execution of the fragment processing by calling `stem_run1`, which processes input fragments and applies the defined callback functions. Overall, this file provides a specialized functionality within a larger system, focusing on the detailed logging and tracing of QUIC connection events, particularly for debugging and monitoring purposes.

# Functions

---
### before\_frag<!-- {{#callable:before_frag}} -->
The `before_frag` function checks if a given signal event is not a QUIC connection close event and returns the result as a boolean integer.
- **Inputs**:
    - `_ctx`: A context pointer, marked as unused in this function.
    - `in_idx`: An index value, marked as unused in this function.
    - `seq`: A sequence number, marked as unused in this function.
    - `sig`: A signal value used to determine the type of event.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function calls `fd_quic_log_sig_event` with the `sig` argument to determine the type of event associated with the signal.
    - It compares the result of `fd_quic_log_sig_event(sig)` with `FD_QUIC_EVENT_CONN_QUIC_CLOSE`.
    - The function returns the negation of the comparison result, effectively returning 1 (true) if the event is not a QUIC connection close event, and 0 (false) otherwise.
- **Output**: An integer value (0 or 1) indicating whether the signal event is not a QUIC connection close event.


---
### during\_frag<!-- {{#callable:during_frag}} -->
The `during_frag` function copies a specified chunk of memory into a buffer within a QUIC context.
- **Inputs**:
    - `_ctx`: A context pointer, marked as unused in this function.
    - `in_idx`: An index value, marked as unused in this function.
    - `seq`: A sequence number, marked as unused in this function.
    - `sig`: A signal value, marked as unused in this function.
    - `chunk`: The chunk identifier used to locate the memory to be copied.
    - `sz`: The size of the memory to be copied.
    - `ctl`: A control value, marked as unused in this function.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Retrieve the global QUIC context `fd_quic_trace_ctx`.
    - Use `fd_chunk_to_laddr_const` to convert the `chunk` identifier into a memory address.
    - Copy `sz` bytes from the calculated memory address into the `buffer` of the QUIC context using `fd_memcpy`.
- **Output**: This function does not return any value; it performs a memory copy operation.


---
### after\_frag<!-- {{#callable:after_frag}} -->
The `after_frag` function logs a QUIC connection close event using data from a buffer in the `fd_quic_ctx_t` context.
- **Inputs**:
    - `_ctx`: A void pointer to a context, marked as unused.
    - `in_idx`: An unsigned long representing the index, marked as unused.
    - `seq`: An unsigned long representing the sequence number, marked as unused.
    - `sig`: An unsigned long representing the signal, marked as unused.
    - `sz`: An unsigned long representing the size, marked as unused.
    - `tsorig`: An unsigned long representing the original timestamp, marked as unused.
    - `tspub`: An unsigned long representing the publication timestamp, marked as unused.
    - `stem`: A pointer to an `fd_stem_context_t` structure, marked as unused.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Retrieve the `fd_quic_ctx_t` context from a global variable `fd_quic_trace_ctx`.
    - Cast the buffer in the context to a `fd_quic_log_error_t` constant pointer using `fd_type_pun_const`.
    - Log the connection close event details using `printf`, including connection ID, source IP, encryption level, packet number, close code, source file, and line number.
- **Output**: The function does not return any value; it outputs a formatted log message to the standard output.


---
### fd\_quic\_trace\_log\_tile<!-- {{#callable:fd_quic_trace_log_tile}} -->
The `fd_quic_trace_log_tile` function processes a single fragment metadata cache using a stem run with a random number generator and scratch space.
- **Inputs**:
    - `in_mcache`: A pointer to a constant `fd_frag_meta_t` structure representing the input fragment metadata cache to be processed.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize an array `in_mcache_tbl` with the input `in_mcache`.
    - Allocate memory for `fseq_mem` and align it according to `FD_FSEQ_ALIGN`.
    - Create a new sequence using `fd_fseq_new` and join it with `fd_fseq_join`, storing the result in `fseq`.
    - Initialize an array `fseq_tbl` with the `fseq` pointer.
    - Create a random number generator `rng` and initialize it with `fd_rng_new` and `fd_rng_join`.
    - Allocate and align scratch space for `fd_stem_tile_in_t` plus additional space.
    - Call `stem_run1` with the initialized parameters to process the input fragment metadata cache.
    - Delete the sequence using `fd_fseq_delete` after leaving it with `fd_fseq_leave`.
- **Output**: This function does not return any value; it performs operations on the input fragment metadata cache and manages resources internally.
