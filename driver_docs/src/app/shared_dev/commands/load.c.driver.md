# Purpose
This C source code file is designed to facilitate the configuration and execution of a load test on an external validator, likely within a distributed system or network environment. The file defines a set of functions that handle command-line arguments, set permissions, and execute the load test. The primary components include functions for parsing command-line arguments ([`load_cmd_args`](#load_cmd_args)), setting up permissions (`load_cmd_perm`), and executing the load test ([`load_cmd_fn`](#load_cmd_fn)). These functions work together to configure network parameters such as IP addresses and ports, as well as test parameters like the number of benchmark generators and connections. The code also integrates with a topology management system, as indicated by the use of `fd_topo_run_tile_t` and `fd_topo_t`, which suggests that the load test is executed across a network topology.

The file imports several headers, indicating its reliance on external libraries and shared components, such as configuration and command utilities. It defines a public API through the `fd_action_load` structure, which encapsulates the load test action, including its name, argument parsing function, permission function, execution function, and a description. This structure is likely used by a larger framework to manage and execute different actions or commands. The code is structured to be part of a larger application, possibly a command-line tool or a service, that performs load testing on networked systems, ensuring that the system can handle specified loads and configurations.

# Global Variables

---
### load\_cmd\_perm
- **Type**: `function pointer`
- **Description**: `load_cmd_perm` is a function pointer that is part of the `fd_action_load` structure, which represents an action to load test an external validator. This function is responsible for setting up permissions or configurations necessary for the load command to execute properly.
- **Use**: It is used as a member of the `fd_action_load` structure to define the permissions or configuration setup for the load action.


---
### fd\_action\_load
- **Type**: `action_t`
- **Description**: The `fd_action_load` is a global variable of type `action_t` that represents an action to load test an external validator. It is initialized with specific function pointers for handling arguments, permissions, and execution logic related to the load testing process.
- **Use**: This variable is used to define and execute the load testing action for an external validator, encapsulating the necessary functions and description for the action.


# Functions

---
### load\_cmd\_args<!-- {{#callable:load_cmd_args}} -->
The `load_cmd_args` function parses command-line arguments to populate an `args_t` structure with configuration settings for a load test.
- **Inputs**:
    - `pargc`: A pointer to an integer representing the count of command-line arguments.
    - `pargv`: A pointer to an array of strings representing the command-line arguments.
    - `args`: A pointer to an `args_t` structure where the parsed command-line arguments will be stored.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Extracts the `--tpu-ip`, `--rpc-ip`, and `--affinity` command-line arguments as strings using `fd_env_strip_cmdline_cstr` and stores them in local variables.
    - Parses and assigns various command-line arguments to the `args->load` structure fields using `fd_env_strip_cmdline_ushort`, `fd_env_strip_cmdline_ulong`, `fd_env_strip_cmdline_int`, and `fd_env_strip_cmdline_float` for different data types.
    - Initializes and appends the `affinity` string to `args->load.affinity` using `fd_cstr_init`, `fd_cstr_append_cstr_safe`, and `fd_cstr_fini`.
    - Sets `args->load.tpu_ip` and `args->load.rpc_ip` to 0 initially, then attempts to convert the `tpu_ip` and `rpc_ip` strings to IP addresses using `fd_cstr_to_ip4_addr`, logging an error if conversion fails.
    - Checks for the presence of the `--no-quic` flag in the command-line arguments using `fd_env_strip_cmdline_contains` and sets `args->load.no_quic` accordingly.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it modifies the `args` structure in place with the parsed command-line arguments.


---
### load\_cmd\_fn<!-- {{#callable:load_cmd_fn}} -->
The `load_cmd_fn` function initializes and configures network and benchmark settings for a load test, then runs the test in a single process.
- **Inputs**:
    - `args`: A pointer to an `args_t` structure containing command-line arguments and settings for the load test.
    - `config`: A pointer to a `config_t` structure containing configuration settings and defaults for the load test.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if `args->load.tpu_ip` is set; if not, use `config->net.ip_addr` as the default.
    - Check if `args->load.rpc_ip` is set; if not, use `config->net.ip_addr` as the default.
    - Check if `args->load.tpu_port` is set; if not, determine the port based on `args->load.no_quic` and set it using `config->tiles.quic` settings.
    - Check if `args->load.rpc_port` is set; if not, use `config->rpc.port` as the default and log an error if still unset.
    - Check if `args->load.affinity` is empty; if so, append `config->development.bench.affinity` to it.
    - Set default values for `args->load.benchg`, `args->load.benchs`, `args->load.accounts`, and `args->load.connections` using `config` if they are not set.
    - Create a new topology object `topo` and configure it with maximum page size and benchmark settings.
    - Update `config->topo` with the new topology settings.
    - Initialize `configure_args` and set the first stage to 'hugetlbfs' if present in `STAGES`.
    - Call `configure_cmd_fn` with `configure_args` and `config`.
    - Initialize workspaces and stacks using `config`.
    - Log the current configuration settings for the load test.
    - Run the topology in a single process using `fd_topo_run_single_process`.
    - Enter an infinite loop to keep the parent thread running indefinitely.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it configures and runs a load test based on the provided arguments and configuration.


# Function Declarations (Public API)

---
### fdctl\_tile\_run<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fdctl_tile_run}} -->
Retrieves a tile configuration by name.
- **Description**: Use this function to obtain the configuration of a specific tile by its name. It searches through a predefined list of tiles and returns the configuration of the tile that matches the provided name. This function should be called when you need to access the configuration details of a tile for further operations. If the tile is not found, an error is logged, and a default-initialized configuration is returned.
- **Inputs**:
    - `tile`: A pointer to an `fd_topo_tile_t` structure representing the tile to be searched. The `name` field of this structure is used to match against the list of available tiles. This pointer must not be null, and the `name` field must be a valid string.
- **Output**: Returns an `fd_topo_run_tile_t` structure containing the configuration of the matched tile. If no matching tile is found, a default-initialized `fd_topo_run_tile_t` is returned.
- **See also**: [`fdctl_tile_run`](../../shared/boot/fd_boot.c.driver.md#fdctl_tile_run)  (Implementation)
