## Files
- **[bench.c](bench/bench.c.driver.md)**: The `bench.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase defines functions for configuring and executing benchmark topologies, including setting CPU affinities and initializing network namespaces.
- **[bench.h](bench/bench.h.driver.md)**: The `bench.h` file in the `firedancer` codebase declares functions and structures for configuring and executing benchmarking commands and topologies.
- **[fd_benchg.c](bench/fd_benchg.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_benchg.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase implements a benchmarking tool for transaction generation, supporting different transaction modes and handling transaction signing and blockhash management.
- **[fd_bencho.c](bench/fd_bencho.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_bencho.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase implements a benchmarking tool that interacts with an RPC server to request and process block hash and transaction count data, managing state transitions and timeouts for these operations.
- **[fd_benchs.c](bench/fd_benchs.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_benchs.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase implements a benchmarking tool for testing QUIC protocol performance, including functions for handling QUIC connections, sending and receiving data, and managing socket communication.
