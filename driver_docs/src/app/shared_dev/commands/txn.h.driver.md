# Purpose
This code is a simple C header file that serves as an interface for a transaction-related action within a larger application. It uses include guards to prevent multiple inclusions, ensuring that the file's contents are only processed once by the compiler. The file includes another header, `fd_config.h`, which likely contains configuration settings or definitions needed for the transaction action. The `extern` keyword declares `fd_action_txn` as an external variable of type `action_t`, indicating that its definition is located elsewhere, possibly in a corresponding source file. This header file is part of a modular system, facilitating the organization and reuse of code related to transaction actions.
# Imports and Dependencies

- `../../shared/fd_config.h`


# Global Variables

### fd\_action\_txn
- **Type**: `action_t`
- **Description**: The variable `fd_action_txn` is a global variable of type `action_t`, which is declared as an external variable. This means it is defined elsewhere, likely in another source file, and is used across multiple files in the program.
- **Use**: `fd_action_txn` is used to represent or store an action transaction, facilitating communication or operations that involve action processing in the application.
