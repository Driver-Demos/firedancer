# Purpose
This code is a simple C header file that serves as an interface for a specific action within a larger application. It includes a guard to prevent multiple inclusions, which is a common practice in C to avoid redefinition errors. The file includes another header, `fd_config.h`, suggesting that it relies on configuration settings defined elsewhere. The primary purpose of this header is to declare an external variable, `fd_action_dump`, of type `action_t`, which is likely defined in another part of the application. This setup indicates that `fd_action_dump` is a shared resource or command that can be used across different parts of the application, facilitating modularity and reusability.
