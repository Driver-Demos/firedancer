# Purpose
The provided C source code file is designed to configure and execute a specific component of a larger system, referred to as the "bundle-client." This file is part of a broader software architecture that involves multiple interconnected components, or "tiles," which are configured and linked together to perform specific tasks. The primary function of this code is to set up the topology for these tiles, configure their parameters, and manage their execution within a shared memory environment. The code includes functions to initialize the topology, configure command-line arguments, and execute the main functionality of the bundle-client, which involves running the "bundle" tile in isolation.

Key technical components of this file include the use of the `fd_topo` and `fd_topob` structures and functions, which are responsible for managing the topology and configuration of the tiles. The code defines several tiles, such as "bundle," "sign," and "metric," and establishes links between them to facilitate communication. It also configures various parameters for these tiles, such as URLs, buffer sizes, and network addresses. The `fd_action_bundle_client` structure defines the action for running the bundle-client, including its name, command-line argument handling, and execution function. This file is intended to be part of a larger system, likely imported and executed as part of a broader application, rather than serving as a standalone executable.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `../../shared/fd_config.h`
- `../../shared/commands/run/run.h`
- `../../../disco/tiles.h`
- `../../../disco/topo/fd_topob.h`
- `unistd.h`


# Global Variables

---
### CALLBACKS
- **Type**: `fd_topo_obj_callbacks_t *`
- **Description**: CALLBACKS is an external array of pointers to fd_topo_obj_callbacks_t structures. This array is used to store callback functions related to topology objects in the system. The specific callbacks are likely defined elsewhere and are used to handle various events or actions within the topology management.
- **Use**: CALLBACKS is used in the fd_topob_finish function to finalize the topology setup by associating the appropriate callbacks with the topology objects.


---
### fd\_action\_bundle\_client
- **Type**: `action_t`
- **Description**: The `fd_action_bundle_client` is a global variable of type `action_t` that represents an action configuration for running a 'bundle-client' command. It includes a name, argument handler, function pointer, permission settings, a description, and a diagnostic flag.
- **Use**: This variable is used to define and configure the execution of the 'bundle-client' action, allowing it to run in isolation with specific command arguments and function logic.


# Functions

---
### bundle\_client\_topo<!-- {{#callable:bundle_client_topo}} -->
The `bundle_client_topo` function initializes and configures a topology for a bundle client, setting up tiles and links based on the provided configuration.
- **Inputs**:
    - `config`: A pointer to a `config_t` structure containing configuration details for setting up the topology, including tile and link parameters.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize a topology object using `fd_topob_new` with the provided configuration name.
    - Set the maximum page size for the topology using `fd_cstr_to_shmem_page_sz`.
    - Create workspaces for 'metric_in', 'bundle', 'sign', and 'metric' using `fd_topob_wksp`.
    - Create tiles for 'bundle', 'sign', and 'metric' using `fd_topob_tile`, each associated with the 'metric_in' workspace.
    - Establish links between tiles using `fd_topob_link`, specifying buffer sizes and other parameters.
    - Configure output and input connections for the tiles using `fd_topob_tile_out` and `fd_topob_tile_in`.
    - Set various configuration parameters for the 'bundle' and 'sign' tiles, such as URLs, key paths, buffer sizes, and keepalive intervals.
    - Parse and set the Prometheus listen address and port for the 'metric' tile, logging an error if parsing fails.
    - Finalize the topology setup with `fd_topob_finish` and print the topology log using `fd_topo_print_log`.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it modifies the `config` structure's `topo` field to reflect the configured topology.


---
### bundle\_client\_cmd\_args<!-- {{#callable:bundle_client_cmd_args}} -->
The `bundle_client_cmd_args` function is a placeholder function that takes three parameters but does not perform any operations with them.
- **Inputs**:
    - `pargc`: A pointer to an integer representing the argument count.
    - `pargv`: A pointer to a pointer to a character array representing the argument vector.
    - `args`: A pointer to an `args_t` structure containing additional arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function takes three parameters: `pargc`, `pargv`, and `args`.
    - Each parameter is cast to void to explicitly indicate that they are unused within the function body.
- **Output**: The function does not return any value or produce any output.


---
### bundle\_client\_cmd\_fn<!-- {{#callable:bundle_client_cmd_fn}} -->
The `bundle_client_cmd_fn` function initializes and runs a bundle client topology in a single process, then enters an infinite pause loop.
- **Inputs**:
    - `args`: A pointer to an `args_t` structure, which is not used in this function.
    - `config`: A pointer to a `config_t` structure containing configuration data for the topology and process execution.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function begins by casting the `args` parameter to void to indicate it is unused.
    - It retrieves the topology from the `config` structure.
    - The [`bundle_client_topo`](#bundle_client_topo) function is called to set up the topology based on the configuration.
    - The `initialize_workspaces` function is called to set up necessary workspaces for the topology.
    - The `initialize_stacks` function is called to set up necessary stacks for the topology.
    - The `fd_topo_join_workspaces` function is called to join the workspaces in read-write mode.
    - The `fd_topo_run_single_process` function is called to run the topology in a single process with specified user and group IDs, using the `fdctl_tile_run` function as the process function.
    - The function enters an infinite loop where it repeatedly calls `pause()`, effectively halting further execution.
- **Output**: The function does not return any value; it enters an infinite loop after setting up and running the topology.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`bundle_client_topo`](#bundle_client_topo)


# Function Declarations (Public API)

---
### fdctl\_tile\_run<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fdctl_tile_run}} -->
Retrieves a tile configuration by name.
- **Description**: Use this function to obtain the configuration of a specific tile by its name. It searches through a predefined list of tiles and returns the configuration of the tile that matches the provided name. This function is useful when you need to access or modify the settings of a particular tile in a topology. Ensure that the tile name provided exists in the list; otherwise, an error is logged, and a default-initialized tile configuration is returned.
- **Inputs**:
    - `tile`: A pointer to an `fd_topo_tile_t` structure representing the tile to be searched for. The `name` field of this structure is used to match against the list of available tiles. This pointer must not be null, and the `name` field must be a valid string.
- **Output**: Returns an `fd_topo_run_tile_t` structure containing the configuration of the matching tile. If no match is found, a default-initialized `fd_topo_run_tile_t` is returned.
- **See also**: [`fdctl_tile_run`](../../shared/boot/fd_boot.c.driver.md#fdctl_tile_run)  (Implementation)
