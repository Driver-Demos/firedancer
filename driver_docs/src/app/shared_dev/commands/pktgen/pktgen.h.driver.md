# Purpose
This code is a C header file that serves as an interface for a packet generation module within a larger application. It uses include guards to prevent multiple inclusions, ensuring that the file's contents are only processed once by the compiler. The file includes another header, `fd_config.h`, which likely contains configuration settings or dependencies needed for the packet generation functionality. Additionally, it declares an external variable, `fd_action_pktgen`, which is presumably a function or data structure related to packet generation actions. This header file is part of a modular system, facilitating the integration and use of packet generation capabilities in the application.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `../../../shared/fd_config.h`


# Global Variables

---
### fd\_action\_pktgen
- **Type**: `action_t`
- **Description**: The variable `fd_action_pktgen` is a global variable of type `action_t`, which is declared as an external variable. This indicates that its definition is located in another source file, and it is intended to be used across multiple files within the program.
- **Use**: `fd_action_pktgen` is used to represent or perform a specific action related to packet generation in the application.
