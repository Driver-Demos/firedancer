# Purpose
This code is a simple C header file that serves as an interface for a specific action within a larger application. It uses include guards to prevent multiple inclusions, which is a common practice in C to avoid redefinition errors. The file includes another header, `fd_config.h`, suggesting that it relies on configuration settings or definitions provided there. It declares an external variable, `fd_action_load`, of type `action_t`, indicating that this header is likely part of a modular system where `fd_action_load` is defined elsewhere and used to perform a specific operation related to loading functionality. This header is part of a structured codebase, likely organized into directories for shared components and development commands.
