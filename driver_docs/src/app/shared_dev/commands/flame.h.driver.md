# Purpose
This code is a simple C header file that serves as an interface for a specific action within a larger application, likely related to device commands or operations. It uses include guards to prevent multiple inclusions, ensuring that the file's contents are only processed once by the compiler. The file includes another header, `fd_config.h`, which suggests it relies on configuration settings or definitions provided elsewhere in the project. The key component of this header is the declaration of an external variable, `fd_action_flame`, of type `action_t`, indicating that this header is used to expose the `fd_action_flame` action to other parts of the program.
# Imports and Dependencies

# Global Variables

### fd\_action\_flame
- **Type**: `action_t`
- **Description**: The variable `fd_action_flame` is a global variable of type `action_t`, which is declared as an external variable. This suggests that its definition is located in another source file, and it is intended to be used across multiple files within the program.
- **Use**: `fd_action_flame` is used to represent a specific action, likely related to a 'flame' command, within the application.
