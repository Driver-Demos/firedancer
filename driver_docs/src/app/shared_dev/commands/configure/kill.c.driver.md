# Purpose
This C source code file is designed to manage and terminate specific processes running on a Linux system. It is part of a larger software system, as indicated by its inclusion of a shared header file (`configure.h`) from a relative path. The primary functionality of this code is to identify and kill processes based on their command-line arguments or memory mappings. It specifically targets processes with command-line arguments ending in "fddev", "fdctl", "firedancer", or "firedancer-dev", as well as processes that have certain memory mappings related to huge pages. The code uses the `/proc` filesystem to inspect running processes and employs system calls like `kill` to terminate them.

The file defines a `configure_stage_t` structure named `fd_cfg_stage_kill`, which encapsulates the logic for this process management task. This structure includes function pointers for initialization ([`init`](#init)), permission checks ([`init_perm`](#init_perm)), and a check function ([`check`](#check)) that likely integrates with a larger configuration or setup process. The code is structured to handle errors robustly, logging detailed error messages if operations like file opening, reading, or process termination fail. This file is not a standalone executable but rather a component intended to be integrated into a larger system, providing a specific utility for managing process lifecycles based on predefined criteria.

# Global Variables

---
### fd\_cfg\_stage\_kill
- **Type**: `configure_stage_t`
- **Description**: The `fd_cfg_stage_kill` is a global variable of type `configure_stage_t` that represents a configuration stage for managing process termination. It is initialized with specific function pointers and parameters to handle the initialization, checking, and potential termination of processes based on certain criteria.
- **Use**: This variable is used to define and manage a configuration stage that checks for and potentially terminates processes that match specific criteria, such as having certain command line arguments or open file descriptors.


# Functions

---
### init\_perm<!-- {{#callable:init_perm}} -->
The `init_perm` function initializes permission checks for file descriptors by invoking `fd_cap_chk_root` with specific parameters.
- **Inputs**:
    - `chk`: A pointer to an `fd_cap_chk_t` structure, which is used to perform capability checks on file descriptors.
    - `config`: A constant pointer to a `config_t` structure, which is marked as unused in this function.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function calls `fd_cap_chk_root` with the `chk` pointer, a constant string `NAME`, and a description string to check all open file descriptors in `/proc/`.
- **Output**: The function does not return any value; it is a `void` function.


---
### cmdline<!-- {{#callable:cmdline}} -->
The `cmdline` function reads the command line arguments of a process specified by its PID from the `/proc` filesystem and stores them in a buffer.
- **Inputs**:
    - `buf`: A character buffer where the command line arguments of the process will be stored.
    - `len`: The size of the buffer `buf`, indicating the maximum number of characters to read.
    - `pid`: The process ID (PID) of the process whose command line arguments are to be read.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Constructs the file path to the process's `cmdline` file in the `/proc` filesystem using the given PID.
    - Attempts to open the constructed file path for reading.
    - If the file does not exist (indicated by `errno == ENOENT`), sets the first character of `buf` to the null terminator and returns.
    - If the file cannot be opened for any other reason, logs an error and terminates the program.
    - Reads up to `len - 1` bytes from the file into `buf`, ensuring not to exceed the buffer size.
    - Checks for read errors and logs an error if any occur, terminating the program.
    - Closes the file and logs an error if closing fails, terminating the program.
    - Appends a null terminator to the end of the read data in `buf` to ensure it is a valid C string.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value but modifies the `buf` to contain the command line arguments of the specified process as a null-terminated string.


---
### maybe\_kill<!-- {{#callable:maybe_kill}} -->
The `maybe_kill` function attempts to terminate a process based on its command line or memory mappings, logging the action and handling errors appropriately.
- **Inputs**:
    - `config`: A pointer to a `config_t` structure containing configuration details, specifically paths related to huge pages.
    - `pid`: An unsigned long integer representing the process ID of the process to be potentially killed.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize a variable `killed` to track if the process was terminated.
    - Retrieve the command line of the process with the given `pid` into `proc_cmdline`.
    - Check if the command line ends with specific strings ('fddev', 'fdctl', 'firedancer', 'firedancer-dev') and attempt to kill the process if a match is found, logging the action.
    - If the process was not killed by command line checks, open and read `/proc/<pid>/maps` to check for specific huge page paths from the configuration and attempt to kill the process if found.
    - If the process was not killed by maps checks, open and read `/proc/<pid>/numa_maps` to check for anonymous hugepages and attempt to kill the process if found.
    - Log errors if file operations fail and return the `killed` status.
- **Output**: Returns an integer indicating whether the process was killed (1) or not (0).
- **Functions called**:
    - [`cmdline`](#cmdline)


---
### wait\_dead<!-- {{#callable:wait_dead}} -->
The `wait_dead` function continuously checks if a process with a given PID has terminated and waits until it is confirmed dead, logging an error if it takes too long.
- **Inputs**:
    - `started`: A long integer representing the wall clock time when the waiting started, used to measure how long the function has been waiting.
    - `pid`: An unsigned long integer representing the process ID of the process to be checked for termination.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function enters an infinite loop to continuously check the status of the process with the given PID.
    - Within the loop, it calls `kill` with signal 0 to check if the process is still alive.
    - If `kill` returns -1 and `errno` is `ESRCH`, it indicates the process does not exist, and the function returns, ending the wait.
    - If `kill` returns -1 for any other reason, it logs an error and exits.
    - If the elapsed time since `started` exceeds 1 second (1e9 nanoseconds), it logs an error indicating that it waited too long for the process to exit.
- **Output**: The function does not return any value; it either exits when the process is confirmed dead or logs an error if it encounters an issue.


---
### init<!-- {{#callable:init}} -->
The `init` function scans the `/proc` directory to identify and potentially terminate specific processes based on their command line or memory mappings, and waits for their termination.
- **Inputs**:
    - `config`: A pointer to a `config_t` structure containing configuration details used to determine which processes to kill.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Open the `/proc` directory to read process entries.
    - Initialize a counter and an array to track processes that need to be waited on after being killed.
    - Iterate over each entry in the `/proc` directory.
    - Skip entries that are not process IDs or represent the current process.
    - Convert the directory entry name to a process ID and attempt to kill the process using [`maybe_kill`](#maybe_kill).
    - If a process is killed, add its PID to the `wait_killed` array.
    - Close the `/proc` directory after processing all entries.
    - Record the current time to track how long the waiting process takes.
    - Iterate over the `wait_killed` array and call [`wait_dead`](#wait_dead) for each PID to ensure the process has terminated.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it performs process termination and waits for their completion as a side effect.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`maybe_kill`](#maybe_kill)
    - [`wait_dead`](#wait_dead)


---
### check<!-- {{#callable:check}} -->
The `check` function is a placeholder that marks the configuration stage as partially configured with the message 'kill existing instances'.
- **Inputs**:
    - `config`: A pointer to a constant `config_t` structure, which is not used in this function.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function calls the macro `PARTIALLY_CONFIGURED` with the string 'kill existing instances'.
- **Output**: The function returns a `configure_result_t` type, but the specific value is determined by the `PARTIALLY_CONFIGURED` macro.
