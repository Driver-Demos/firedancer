# Purpose
This C source code file defines a command action for a software application, specifically to display the current version of the software. It includes necessary configuration and action headers and utilizes external string variables `fdctl_version_string` and `fdctl_commit_ref_string` to retrieve version information. The `version_cmd_fn` function is implemented to output the version and commit reference to the standard output, formatted as a string. The `fd_action_version` structure is initialized to represent this action, with its name set to "version" and a description indicating its purpose. This code is likely part of a larger command-line interface (CLI) tool, where actions are modularly defined and executed based on user input.

- `unistd.h`


# Global Variables

---
### fdctl\_version\_string
- **Type**: ``char const[]``
- **Description**: The `fdctl_version_string` is a constant character array that holds the version information of the software. It is declared as an external variable, indicating that its definition is located in another file.
- **Use**: This variable is used to display the current software version when the `version_cmd_fn` function is called.


---
### fdctl\_commit\_ref\_string
- **Type**: ``char const[]``
- **Description**: The `fdctl_commit_ref_string` is a global constant character array that holds a string representing the commit reference of the software. It is declared as an external variable, indicating that its definition is located in another translation unit.
- **Use**: This variable is used to display the commit reference in the version command output.


---
### version\_cmd\_fn
- **Type**: `function`
- **Description**: The `version_cmd_fn` is a function that outputs the current software version and commit reference to the standard output. It uses two external string variables, `fdctl_version_string` and `fdctl_commit_ref_string`, to retrieve and display this information.
- **Use**: This function is used as a command handler to display the software version information when invoked.


---
### fd\_action\_version
- **Type**: `action_t`
- **Description**: The `fd_action_version` is a global variable of type `action_t` that represents an action to display the current software version. It is initialized with a name, a function pointer to `version_cmd_fn`, and a description of its purpose.
- **Use**: This variable is used to define and execute the action of showing the software version when invoked.
