# Purpose
This code is a C header file that defines an interface for memory-related command functionality within an application. It includes a function prototype for [`mem_cmd_fn`](#mem_cmd_fn), which likely handles memory command operations, taking pointers to `args_t` and `config_t` structures as parameters, suggesting it processes command arguments and configuration settings. The file also declares an external variable `fd_action_mem` of type `action_t`, which is presumably used to represent or trigger a specific memory-related action within the application. The inclusion of `fd_config.h` suggests that this header relies on configuration settings defined elsewhere, ensuring modularity and reusability. The use of include guards prevents multiple inclusions of this header file, maintaining compilation efficiency and preventing redefinition errors.

### fd\_action\_mem
- **Type**: `action_t`
- **Description**: The variable `fd_action_mem` is a global variable of type `action_t`. It is declared as an external variable, indicating that its definition is located in another source file. The `action_t` type suggests that this variable is likely used to represent an action or command within the application.
- **Use**: This variable is used to store and manage a specific action or command related to memory operations in the application.
