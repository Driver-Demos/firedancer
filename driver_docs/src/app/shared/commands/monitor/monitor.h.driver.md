# Purpose
This code is a C header file that defines the interface for a set of monitoring commands within an application. It includes function prototypes for three functions: [`monitor_cmd_args`](#monitor_cmd_args), [`monitor_cmd_perm`](#monitor_cmd_perm), and [`monitor_cmd_fn`](#monitor_cmd_fn), which are likely responsible for handling command-line arguments, checking permissions, and executing a monitoring command, respectively. The file also declares an external variable `fd_action_monitor`, which suggests it is used to represent or trigger a specific action related to monitoring. The inclusion of `fd_config.h` indicates that the functions may rely on configuration settings defined elsewhere. The use of include guards ensures that the header file is only included once during compilation, preventing redefinition errors.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `../../fd_config.h`


# Global Variables

---
### fd\_action\_monitor
- **Type**: `action_t`
- **Description**: The `fd_action_monitor` is a global variable of type `action_t`, which is likely a custom data type defined elsewhere in the codebase. It is declared as an external variable, indicating that it is defined in another source file and is accessible from this header file.
- **Use**: This variable is used to represent or perform a specific action related to monitoring within the application.


# Function Declarations (Public API)

---
### monitor\_cmd\_args<!-- {{#callable_declaration:monitor_cmd_args}} -->
Parses and processes command-line arguments for monitoring configuration.
- **Description**: This function is used to parse and process command-line arguments related to monitoring configuration, updating the provided `args` structure with the parsed values. It should be called with valid pointers to the argument count and argument vector, as well as a pre-allocated `args_t` structure. The function extracts specific command-line options, such as `--dt-min`, `--dt-max`, `--duration`, and `--seed`, and updates the `args` structure accordingly. It also checks for the presence of `--bench` and `--sankey` flags. Preconditions include ensuring that the argument count and vector are correctly initialized and that the `args` structure is allocated. The function will log errors and terminate if invalid values are detected, such as negative durations or inconsistent minimum and maximum delta times.
- **Inputs**:
    - `pargc`: A pointer to the argument count, which must be non-null and correctly initialized. The function may modify this value as it processes and removes recognized arguments.
    - `pargv`: A pointer to the argument vector, which must be non-null and correctly initialized. The function may modify this array as it processes and removes recognized arguments.
    - `args`: A pointer to an `args_t` structure that will be populated with the parsed command-line arguments. This structure must be pre-allocated and non-null.
- **Output**: None
- **See also**: [`monitor_cmd_args`](monitor.c.driver.md#monitor_cmd_args)  (Implementation)


---
### monitor\_cmd\_fn<!-- {{#callable_declaration:monitor_cmd_fn}} -->
Executes the monitor command with specified arguments and configuration.
- **Description**: This function is used to execute a monitoring command based on the provided arguments and configuration. It sets up necessary signal handlers, configures file descriptors, and applies security policies before running the monitor. This function should be called when a monitoring operation is required, and it assumes that the arguments and configuration have been properly initialized. It handles signal interruptions and ensures that resources are properly managed during execution. The function will terminate the process upon completion, so it should be the final operation in a program's execution flow.
- **Inputs**:
    - `args`: A pointer to an `args_t` structure containing the command-line arguments for the monitor. The structure must be properly initialized and must not be null. Invalid values may lead to undefined behavior.
    - `config`: A pointer to a `config_t` structure containing the configuration settings for the monitor. This structure must be properly initialized and must not be null. The function relies on this configuration to set up the monitoring environment.
- **Output**: None
- **See also**: [`monitor_cmd_fn`](monitor.c.driver.md#monitor_cmd_fn)  (Implementation)
