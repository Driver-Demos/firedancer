# Purpose
This C header file, `monitor_seccomp.h`, is a generated file that defines a seccomp (secure computing mode) filter policy for a monitoring application. The primary purpose of this file is to provide a predefined set of rules that restrict the system calls a process can make, enhancing security by limiting the process's ability to perform potentially harmful operations. The file includes necessary headers for working with seccomp and BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter) and defines architecture-specific constants to ensure compatibility with different CPU architectures such as i386, x86_64, and aarch64.

The core functionality is encapsulated in the [`populate_sock_filter_policy_monitor`](#populate_sock_filter_policy_monitor) function, which initializes a BPF program consisting of 36 instructions. This program checks the architecture of the running process and allows or denies specific system calls based on predefined conditions. The filter allows certain system calls like `write`, `fsync`, `nanosleep`, `sched_yield`, `exit_group`, `read`, `ioctl`, and `pselect6` under specific conditions, while any other system calls result in the process being killed. This approach ensures that only safe and necessary operations are permitted, thereby reducing the attack surface of the application. The file is intended to be included in other C source files where this seccomp policy is required, and it does not define any public APIs or external interfaces beyond the function to populate the filter.

# Global Variables

---
### sock\_filter\_policy\_monitor\_instr\_cnt
- **Type**: `unsigned int`
- **Description**: The `sock_filter_policy_monitor_instr_cnt` is a constant unsigned integer that represents the number of instructions in a socket filter policy used for monitoring purposes. It is set to 36, indicating the total number of BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter) instructions in the filter array.
- **Use**: This variable is used to ensure that the output buffer for the socket filter policy has enough space to accommodate all 36 instructions.


# Functions

---
### populate\_sock\_filter\_policy\_monitor<!-- {{#callable:populate_sock_filter_policy_monitor}} -->
The function `populate_sock_filter_policy_monitor` initializes a seccomp BPF filter to enforce a security policy on system calls, allowing or killing processes based on specific conditions.
- **Inputs**:
    - `out_cnt`: The number of elements in the output filter array, which must be at least 36.
    - `out`: A pointer to an array of `struct sock_filter` where the filter instructions will be copied.
    - `logfile_fd`: The file descriptor for the log file, used in syscall checks to determine if certain syscalls should be allowed.
    - `drain_output_fd`: The file descriptor for draining output, used in syscall checks to determine if certain syscalls should be allowed.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if `out_cnt` is at least 36 using `FD_TEST` macro.
    - Define a static array `filter` of 36 `struct sock_filter` elements to hold the BPF instructions.
    - Load the architecture from `seccomp_data` and compare it with the expected architecture `ARCH_NR`; if they don't match, jump to `RET_KILL_PROCESS`.
    - Load the syscall number and check against allowed syscalls like `SYS_write`, `SYS_fsync`, `SYS_nanosleep`, `SYS_sched_yield`, `SYS_exit_group`, `SYS_read`, `SYS_ioctl`, and `SYS_pselect6`.
    - For each syscall, load the appropriate arguments and compare them with expected values (e.g., `logfile_fd`, `drain_output_fd`, `TCGETS`, `TCSETS`) to determine if the syscall should be allowed or if the process should be killed.
    - If none of the syscalls match, jump to `RET_KILL_PROCESS`.
    - Copy the constructed filter array into the output array `out` using `fd_memcpy`.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it populates the `out` array with the BPF filter instructions.
