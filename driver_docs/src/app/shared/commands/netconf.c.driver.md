# Purpose
This C source code file defines a function [`netconf_cmd_fn`](#netconf_cmd_fn) that is responsible for printing network configuration details, such as network interfaces, IPv4 routing tables, and neighbor tables. The function is part of a larger system that appears to manage or interact with network configurations, likely within a specific network topology or infrastructure. The code utilizes several external components and libraries, as indicated by the numerous `#include` directives, which bring in functionality related to network device tables, IPv4 forwarding information bases (FIBs), and neighbor mappings. The function accesses these components through a topology configuration structure (`fd_topo_t`), which it uses to locate and join various workspaces and tiles that represent different network elements.

The file also defines an `action_t` structure named `fd_action_netconf`, which associates the [`netconf_cmd_fn`](#netconf_cmd_fn) function with a specific action named "netconf". This structure suggests that the function is part of a broader action-based framework, where different actions can be executed based on their names and associated functions. The `fd_action_netconf` structure includes metadata such as the action's name, a description, and a pointer to the function itself, indicating that this code is designed to be integrated into a larger system that can execute various network-related actions. The primary purpose of this file is to provide a mechanism for retrieving and displaying network configuration information in a structured and organized manner.

# Global Variables

---
### fd\_action\_netconf
- **Type**: `action_t`
- **Description**: The `fd_action_netconf` is a global variable of type `action_t` that represents an action to print network configuration details. It is initialized with a name, a function pointer to `netconf_cmd_fn`, and a description of its purpose.
- **Use**: This variable is used to define and execute the action of printing network configuration when invoked.


# Functions

---
### netconf\_cmd\_fn<!-- {{#callable:netconf_cmd_fn}} -->
The `netconf_cmd_fn` function retrieves and prints network configuration details such as interfaces, IPv4 routes, and neighbor tables from a specified network topology.
- **Inputs**:
    - `args`: A pointer to an `args_t` structure, which is not used in this function.
    - `config`: A pointer to a `config_t` structure that contains the network topology information.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function begins by ignoring the `args` parameter and extracting the topology from the `config` parameter.
    - It searches for the 'netbase' workspace in the topology and logs an error if not found.
    - It searches for the 'netlnk' tile in the topology and logs an error if not found.
    - The function joins the 'netbase' workspace in read-only mode.
    - It prints the network interfaces by joining the double buffer for network devices, reading its contents, and printing them.
    - It prints the main IPv4 routes by joining the FIB4 structure and printing its contents.
    - It prints the local IPv4 routes similarly by joining another FIB4 structure and printing its contents.
    - Finally, it prints the neighbor table by joining the neighbor hash map and printing its contents.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it outputs network configuration details to the standard output.
