# Purpose
This C source code file defines a function and an action structure related to memory and topology information within a larger framework, likely for a system or application dealing with hardware or resource management. The `mem_cmd_fn` function is implemented to log memory and tile topology information using the `fd_topo_print_log` function, which is called with a log level and a topology configuration. The `fd_action_mem` structure is an instance of `action_t` that encapsulates this function, associating it with the name "mem" and providing a description of its purpose. This setup suggests that the code is part of a modular system where actions are defined and executed based on configurations, possibly for diagnostic or monitoring purposes.
# Imports and Dependencies

- `../fd_action.h`


# Global Variables

---
### mem\_cmd\_fn
- **Type**: `function pointer`
- **Description**: The `mem_cmd_fn` is a function that takes two parameters: a pointer to an `args_t` structure and a pointer to a `config_t` structure. It is used to print memory and tile topology information by calling `fd_topo_print_log` with the topology data from the `config` parameter.
- **Use**: This function is used as a callback or action function in the `fd_action_mem` structure to execute memory and topology logging.


---
### fd\_action\_mem
- **Type**: `action_t`
- **Description**: The `fd_action_mem` is a global variable of type `action_t`, which is a structure designed to represent an action or command within the system. It is initialized with specific values, including a name, a function pointer, and a description, which collectively define its behavior and purpose.
- **Use**: This variable is used to define an action that prints workspace memory and tile topology information when executed.
