# Purpose
This code is a C header file that defines the interface for a help command within an application. It includes a function prototype for [`help_cmd_fn`](#help_cmd_fn), which likely handles the execution of the help command, taking arguments and configuration data as parameters. The file also declares an external variable `fd_action_help`, which is presumably used to represent or trigger the help action within the application. The header guards prevent multiple inclusions of this file, ensuring that the declarations are only processed once during compilation. This file is part of a larger application, as indicated by the inclusion of a configuration header (`fd_config.h`) and the use of custom macros (`FD_PROTOTYPES_BEGIN` and `FD_PROTOTYPES_END`) to manage function prototypes.

### fd\_action\_help
- **Type**: `action_t`
- **Description**: The `fd_action_help` is a global variable of type `action_t`, which is likely a custom data type defined elsewhere in the codebase. It is declared as an external variable, indicating that it is defined in another source file and is accessible from this header file.
- **Use**: This variable is used to represent or trigger a help action within the application, likely associated with the `help_cmd_fn` function.
