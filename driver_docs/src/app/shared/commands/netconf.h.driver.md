# Purpose
This code is a C header file that provides declarations for network configuration commands within an application. It includes a function prototype for [`netconf_cmd_fn`](#netconf_cmd_fn), which likely handles network configuration tasks using the provided `args_t` and `config_t` structures. The file also declares an external variable `fd_action_netconf`, which suggests it is used to represent or trigger a specific network-related action within the application. The inclusion of `fd_config.h` indicates that this header relies on configuration settings defined elsewhere. The use of include guards prevents multiple inclusions of this header file, ensuring efficient compilation.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `../fd_config.h`


# Global Variables

---
### fd\_action\_netconf
- **Type**: `action_t`
- **Description**: The variable `fd_action_netconf` is a global variable of type `action_t`. It is declared as an external variable, indicating that its definition is located in another source file.
- **Use**: This variable is used to represent a specific action related to network configuration within the application.


# Function Declarations (Public API)

---
### netconf\_cmd\_fn<!-- {{#callable_declaration:netconf_cmd_fn}} -->
Displays network configuration details.
- **Description**: This function is used to display various network configuration details, including interfaces, IPv4 routes, and neighbor tables. It should be called when a detailed view of the network topology and configuration is required. The function requires a valid configuration object to access the network topology and assumes that the necessary network components are present and correctly configured. It outputs the information directly to the standard output.
- **Inputs**:
    - `args`: A pointer to an `args_t` structure. This parameter is currently unused and can be set to NULL.
    - `config`: A pointer to a `config_t` structure that contains the network topology information. Must not be NULL, and the configuration should be properly initialized and populated with the necessary network components.
- **Output**: None
- **See also**: [`netconf_cmd_fn`](netconf.c.driver.md#netconf_cmd_fn)  (Implementation)
