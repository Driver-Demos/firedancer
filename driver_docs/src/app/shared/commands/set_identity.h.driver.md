# Purpose
This code is a C header file that defines the interface for a command related to setting an identity within an application. It includes a function prototype for [`set_identity_cmd_fn`](#set_identity_cmd_fn), which takes pointers to `args_t` and `config_t` structures, suggesting it processes command-line arguments and configuration data. The file also declares an external variable `fd_action_set_identity`, likely representing an action or command that can be executed within the application. The inclusion of `fd_config.h` indicates that this header relies on configuration settings defined elsewhere. The use of include guards prevents multiple inclusions of this header file, ensuring efficient compilation.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `../fd_config.h`


# Global Variables

---
### fd\_action\_set\_identity
- **Type**: `action_t`
- **Description**: The variable `fd_action_set_identity` is a global variable of type `action_t`. It is declared as an external variable, indicating that its definition is located in another source file.
- **Use**: This variable is used to represent an action related to setting identity, likely within a larger application framework that handles various actions.


# Function Declarations (Public API)

---
### set\_identity\_cmd\_fn<!-- {{#callable_declaration:set_identity_cmd_fn}} -->
Sets the identity configuration using the provided arguments.
- **Description**: This function is used to configure the identity settings based on the provided arguments and configuration structure. It should be called when there is a need to update or set identity parameters within the application. The function requires valid pointers to both the arguments and configuration structures, and it is expected that these structures are properly initialized before calling the function. The caller must ensure that the pointers are not null to avoid undefined behavior.
- **Inputs**:
    - `args`: A pointer to an args_t structure containing the arguments for setting the identity. Must not be null and should be properly initialized before calling the function.
    - `config`: A pointer to a config_t structure that holds the configuration settings to be applied. Must not be null and should be properly initialized before calling the function.
- **Output**: None
- **See also**: [`set_identity_cmd_fn`](set_identity.c.driver.md#set_identity_cmd_fn)  (Implementation)
