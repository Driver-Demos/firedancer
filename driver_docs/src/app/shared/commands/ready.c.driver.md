# Purpose
The provided C code is a part of a larger software system, likely related to distributed computing or a networked application, as suggested by the use of terms like "tiles" and "workspaces." This file defines a function `ready_cmd_fn` that is responsible for ensuring that all computational units, referred to as "tiles," are in a ready state before proceeding with further operations. The function interacts with a topology configuration, joining a specific workspace in read-only mode and checking the status of each tile. It logs messages to indicate the readiness of tiles and handles any errors if a tile is in an unexpected state. The function is part of an action structure `fd_action_ready`, which includes metadata such as the action's name, description, and the function pointer to `ready_cmd_fn`.

This code provides a specific functionality within a broader system, focusing on the initialization and readiness check of computational units. It is not a standalone executable but rather a component intended to be integrated into a larger application, as indicated by the inclusion of headers and the use of external functions and structures. The code does not define public APIs or external interfaces directly but contributes to the internal logic of the system by ensuring that all necessary components are operational before the system proceeds with its tasks. The use of logging and error handling suggests that reliability and monitoring are important aspects of this system.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `run/run.h`
- `../../../disco/metrics/fd_metrics.h`


# Global Variables

---
### ready\_cmd\_fn
- **Type**: `function`
- **Description**: The `ready_cmd_fn` is a function that checks the readiness of tiles in a topology configuration. It identifies a workspace by name, joins it in read-only mode, and iterates over the tiles to ensure they are in a ready state, logging any issues encountered.
- **Use**: This function is used as a callback or command function to ensure that all tiles in a given configuration are ready before proceeding with further operations.


---
### fd\_action\_ready
- **Type**: `action_t`
- **Description**: The `fd_action_ready` is a global variable of type `action_t` that represents an action with the name 'ready'. It is configured to execute the function `ready_cmd_fn`, which is responsible for ensuring that all tiles are in a running state. The variable does not require any arguments or permissions and includes a description indicating its purpose.
- **Use**: This variable is used to define and execute the 'ready' action, which waits for all tiles to be operational.
