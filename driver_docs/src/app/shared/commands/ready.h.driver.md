# Purpose
This code is a C header file that defines an interface for a command function and an external action related to a "ready" command within an application. It includes a configuration header file, `fd_config.h`, suggesting that it relies on predefined configurations or settings. The file declares a function prototype, [`ready_cmd_fn`](#ready_cmd_fn), which takes pointers to `args_t` and `config_t` structures, indicating that it processes command arguments and configuration data. Additionally, it declares an external variable, `fd_action_ready`, of type `action_t`, which likely represents an action or operation associated with the "ready" command. The use of include guards ensures that the file's contents are only included once during compilation, preventing redefinition errors.

### fd\_action\_ready
- **Type**: `action_t`
- **Description**: The variable `fd_action_ready` is a global variable of type `action_t`. It is declared as an external variable, indicating that its definition is likely located in another source file. The `action_t` type suggests that this variable is used to represent an action or command within the application.
- **Use**: `fd_action_ready` is used to reference a specific action or command that is ready to be executed within the application.
