## Files
- **[main_seccomp.h](generated/main_seccomp.h.driver.md)**: The `main_seccomp.h` file in the `firedancer` codebase defines a generated seccomp filter policy for restricting system calls based on architecture and specific syscall conditions.
- **[pidns_arm64_seccomp.h](generated/pidns_arm64_seccomp.h.driver.md)**: The `pidns_arm64_seccomp.h` file is a generated header file that defines a seccomp filter policy for ARM64 architecture, specifying rules for allowing or killing processes based on system call checks.
- **[pidns_seccomp.h](generated/pidns_seccomp.h.driver.md)**: The `pidns_seccomp.h` file in the `firedancer` codebase is a generated header file that defines a seccomp filter policy for process isolation, allowing specific system calls and killing the process for others based on architecture and syscall arguments.
