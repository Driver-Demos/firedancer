# Purpose
This C header file is a generated file that defines a seccomp (secure computing mode) filter policy for a specific application. The primary purpose of this file is to provide a predefined set of rules that restrict the system calls an application can make, enhancing security by limiting the application's ability to perform potentially harmful operations. The file includes necessary headers for working with seccomp and BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter) and defines architecture-specific constants to ensure compatibility with the runtime environment. The core functionality is encapsulated in the [`populate_sock_filter_policy_main`](#populate_sock_filter_policy_main) function, which initializes a `sock_filter` array with a series of BPF instructions. These instructions are designed to allow or deny specific system calls based on their number and arguments, with a focus on allowing only a limited set of operations such as `write`, `fsync`, `wait4`, `kill`, and `exit_group`, while killing the process for any other unauthorized system calls.

The file is not intended to be edited manually, as indicated by the comment at the top, and is likely part of a larger system where it is included to enforce security policies. The seccomp filter is implemented using BPF instructions, which are loaded into the kernel to perform checks on system calls made by the application. The filter uses conditional jumps to either allow the system call or terminate the process, depending on whether the call matches the allowed criteria. This file is a critical component in a security framework, providing a narrow but essential functionality focused on process isolation and security enforcement.

# Global Variables

---
### sock\_filter\_policy\_main\_instr\_cnt
- **Type**: `unsigned int`
- **Description**: The variable `sock_filter_policy_main_instr_cnt` is a static constant of type unsigned int, initialized with the value 25. It represents the number of instructions in the main socket filter policy used in a seccomp filter setup.
- **Use**: This variable is used to ensure that the output buffer in the `populate_sock_filter_policy_main` function has enough space to hold the 25 instructions of the seccomp filter.


# Functions

---
### populate\_sock\_filter\_policy\_main<!-- {{#callable:populate_sock_filter_policy_main}} -->
The function `populate_sock_filter_policy_main` initializes a seccomp BPF filter to enforce a security policy on system calls, allowing or killing processes based on specific conditions.
- **Inputs**:
    - `out_cnt`: The number of elements in the output buffer, which must be at least 25.
    - `out`: A pointer to an array of `struct sock_filter` where the filter instructions will be copied.
    - `logfile_fd`: The file descriptor for the log file, used in syscall argument checks.
    - `pid_namespace`: The process ID namespace, used in syscall argument checks.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if `out_cnt` is at least 25 using `FD_TEST` macro.
    - Define a static array `filter` of 25 `struct sock_filter` elements to hold the BPF instructions.
    - Load the architecture from `seccomp_data` and compare it with `ARCH_NR`; jump to `RET_KILL_PROCESS` if they don't match.
    - Load the syscall number and check if it matches `SYS_write`, `SYS_fsync`, `SYS_wait4`, `SYS_kill`, or `SYS_exit_group`, jumping to specific labels or `RET_ALLOW` if matched.
    - For `SYS_write`, check if the first argument is 2 or `logfile_fd`, allowing the syscall if matched, otherwise jump to `RET_KILL_PROCESS`.
    - For `SYS_fsync`, check if the first argument is `logfile_fd`, allowing the syscall if matched, otherwise jump to `RET_KILL_PROCESS`.
    - For `SYS_wait4`, check if the first argument is `pid_namespace`, the second argument is `__WALL`, and the third argument is 0, allowing the syscall if all match, otherwise jump to `RET_KILL_PROCESS`.
    - For `SYS_kill`, check if the second argument is `SIGKILL`, allowing the syscall if matched, otherwise jump to `RET_KILL_PROCESS`.
    - If none of the syscalls match, jump to `RET_KILL_PROCESS`.
    - Copy the `filter` array to the `out` buffer using `fd_memcpy`.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it populates the `out` buffer with the BPF filter instructions.
