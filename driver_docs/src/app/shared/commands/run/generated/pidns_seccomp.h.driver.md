# Purpose
This C header file is automatically generated and is designed to define a seccomp (secure computing mode) filter policy for a process running in a PID namespace. The file includes necessary Linux headers and defines architecture-specific constants to ensure compatibility with different CPU architectures such as i386, x86_64, and aarch64. The primary function, [`populate_sock_filter_policy_pidns`](#populate_sock_filter_policy_pidns), initializes a Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF) program that enforces a security policy by allowing or denying specific system calls based on predefined rules. The filter checks the architecture of the running process and allows certain system calls like `write`, `fsync`, `poll`, `wait4`, and `exit_group` under specific conditions, while any other system calls result in the process being killed.

The file is intended to be included in other C source files where seccomp filtering is required to enhance security by restricting the system calls a process can make. This is particularly useful in containerized environments or applications that require strict isolation from the host system. The seccomp filter is implemented using BPF instructions, which are loaded into the kernel to enforce the policy at runtime. The file does not define public APIs or external interfaces but provides a specific implementation detail for processes that need to adhere to a strict security policy.

# Global Variables

---
### sock\_filter\_policy\_pidns\_instr\_cnt
- **Type**: `unsigned int`
- **Description**: The `sock_filter_policy_pidns_instr_cnt` is a constant unsigned integer that specifies the number of instructions in a socket filter policy for process ID namespaces. It is set to 25, indicating that the filter policy consists of 25 instructions.
- **Use**: This variable is used to ensure that the output buffer in the `populate_sock_filter_policy_pidns` function has enough space to hold the 25 instructions of the socket filter policy.


# Functions

---
### populate\_sock\_filter\_policy\_pidns<!-- {{#callable:populate_sock_filter_policy_pidns}} -->
The function `populate_sock_filter_policy_pidns` initializes a seccomp filter policy for a process, allowing or killing specific system calls based on predefined rules.
- **Inputs**:
    - `out_cnt`: The number of elements in the output filter array, which must be at least 25.
    - `out`: A pointer to an array of `struct sock_filter` where the filter policy will be copied.
    - `logfile_fd`: The file descriptor for the log file, used in syscall argument checks.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function begins by asserting that `out_cnt` is at least 25 using `FD_TEST`.
    - A static array `filter` of 25 `struct sock_filter` elements is defined, representing the seccomp filter policy.
    - The filter checks if the architecture of the script matches the runtime architecture, jumping to `RET_KILL_PROCESS` if not.
    - It loads the syscall number and checks if it matches specific syscalls (`write`, `fsync`, `poll`, `wait4`, `exit_group`), allowing them based on further conditions or jumping to `RET_KILL_PROCESS`.
    - For `write` and `fsync`, it checks if the first argument matches `2` or `logfile_fd`, respectively, to allow the syscall.
    - For `poll`, it checks if the third argument is `-1` to allow the syscall.
    - For `wait4`, it checks specific flags in the third argument and a zero in the fourth argument to allow the syscall.
    - If none of the conditions are met, the default action is to kill the process (`RET_KILL_PROCESS`).
    - The filter is copied to the output array `out` using `fd_memcpy`.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it populates the `out` array with the seccomp filter policy.
