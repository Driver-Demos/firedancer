# Purpose
This C header file is a generated source file that defines a seccomp (secure computing mode) filter policy specifically for the ARM64 architecture. The file is not intended to be edited manually, as indicated by the comment at the top. It includes necessary headers for seccomp and BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter) operations, which are used to create a filter that restricts the system calls a process can make. The file defines a function, [`populate_sock_filter_policy_pidns_arm64`](#populate_sock_filter_policy_pidns_arm64), which initializes a BPF filter array with specific rules to allow or deny certain system calls based on the architecture and syscall numbers. The filter is designed to allow specific syscalls like `write`, `fsync`, `ppoll`, `wait4`, and `exit_group` under certain conditions, while any other syscall results in the process being killed.

The file is part of a broader system that likely involves process isolation or sandboxing, using seccomp to enforce security policies by limiting the syscalls available to a process. The use of architecture-specific definitions ensures that the filter is only applied on compatible systems, and the inclusion of various Linux headers suggests that this code is intended for use in a Linux environment. The file does not define public APIs or external interfaces directly but provides a critical internal component for a larger application that requires syscall filtering for security purposes.

# Global Variables

---
### sock\_filter\_policy\_pidns\_arm64\_instr\_cnt
- **Type**: `unsigned int`
- **Description**: The variable `sock_filter_policy_pidns_arm64_instr_cnt` is a constant unsigned integer that holds the value 23. It represents the number of instructions in a specific socket filter policy for ARM64 architecture.
- **Use**: This variable is used to ensure that the output buffer in the `populate_sock_filter_policy_pidns_arm64` function has enough space to hold all 23 instructions of the filter policy.


# Functions

---
### populate\_sock\_filter\_policy\_pidns\_arm64<!-- {{#callable:populate_sock_filter_policy_pidns_arm64}} -->
The function `populate_sock_filter_policy_pidns_arm64` initializes a seccomp filter policy for ARM64 architecture to control system call permissions based on predefined rules.
- **Inputs**:
    - `out_cnt`: The number of elements in the output filter array, which must be at least 23.
    - `out`: A pointer to an array of `struct sock_filter` where the filter policy will be copied.
    - `logfile_fd`: The file descriptor for the log file, used in syscall argument checks.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if `out_cnt` is at least 23 using `FD_TEST` macro.
    - Define a `struct sock_filter` array `filter` with 23 elements to specify the seccomp filter rules.
    - Load the architecture from `seccomp_data` and compare it with `ARCH_NR`; if not equal, jump to `RET_KILL_PROCESS`.
    - Load the syscall number and check against allowed syscalls (`write`, `fsync`, `ppoll`, `wait4`, `exit_group`).
    - For `write` and `fsync`, check if the first argument matches `logfile_fd` or is 2, otherwise jump to `RET_KILL_PROCESS`.
    - For `wait4`, check specific conditions on arguments 2 and 3, otherwise jump to `RET_KILL_PROCESS`.
    - If none of the syscalls match, jump to `RET_KILL_PROCESS`.
    - Copy the `filter` array to the `out` array using `fd_memcpy`.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it populates the `out` array with the seccomp filter policy.
