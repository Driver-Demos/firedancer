# Purpose
The provided content outlines a configuration policy for the boot process of a software system called Firedancer, which involves managing process namespaces and logging. The primary role of this boot process is to create a child process within a PID namespace and then act as a supervisor, monitoring the child process's lifecycle. The configuration specifies logging behavior, ensuring that all log messages are written to a designated file, with warnings and higher severity messages also directed to STDERR. It also details the synchronization of log files to disk and the conditions under which the supervisor process waits for the child process to exit, as well as how it handles termination signals to cleanly shut down the child process. This setup ensures that the boot process can effectively manage and terminate the child process, maintaining system stability and logging integrity.
