# Purpose
The provided content is a configuration file that outlines a security policy for managing process behavior in a software system called Firedancer, specifically focusing on the child process that launches tiles within a PID namespace. This policy is crucial for ensuring that if the init process (PID 0) within the namespace is terminated, all associated Firedancer tiles are also terminated by the kernel, maintaining system integrity. The file specifies logging behavior, where log messages are directed to a file and/or STDERR, with critical messages ('WARNING' and above) being immediately synchronized to disk. It also details process supervision, using the `wait4` syscall to monitor and retrieve exit statuses of child processes, ensuring that the parent process exits appropriately when a child process terminates, thereby managing the lifecycle of the process group effectively.
