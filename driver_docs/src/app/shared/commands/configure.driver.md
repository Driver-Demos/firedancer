## Files
- **[configure.c](configure/configure.c.driver.md)**: The `configure.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase implements the command-line interface for configuring the local host to run Firedancer, handling commands such as initialization, checking, and finalization of configuration stages, and verifying file and directory permissions.
- **[configure.h](configure/configure.h.driver.md)**: The `configure.h` file in the `firedancer` codebase defines structures, macros, and functions for managing configuration stages and checking file and directory configurations.
- **[ethtool-channels.c](configure/ethtool-channels.c.driver.md)**: The `ethtool-channels.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase is responsible for configuring network device channels using `ethtool`, specifically setting and verifying the number of channels for network interfaces, including handling bonded devices and ensuring compatibility with the XDP network stack.
- **[ethtool-gro.c](configure/ethtool-gro.c.driver.md)**: The `ethtool-gro.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase is responsible for disabling the "Generic Receive Offload" feature on network interfaces to prevent packet corruption when using AF_XDP, particularly for QUIC short packets.
- **[ethtool-loopback.c](configure/ethtool-loopback.c.driver.md)**: The `ethtool-loopback.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase is responsible for disabling the "tx-udp-segmentation" offload on the loopback interface to ensure compatibility with AF_XDP by using ethtool commands.
- **[hugetlbfs.c](configure/hugetlbfs.c.driver.md)**: The `hugetlbfs.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase is responsible for configuring, initializing, and managing huge page filesystems (hugetlbfs) on a system, including setting permissions, mounting, and unmounting operations, as well as checking the configuration status.
- **[hyperthreads.c](configure/hyperthreads.c.driver.md)**: The `hyperthreads.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase is responsible for configuring and checking the status of hyperthread pairs in a CPU topology, issuing warnings if certain conditions that may affect performance are met.
- **[sysctl.c](configure/sysctl.c.driver.md)**: The `sysctl.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase is responsible for configuring and verifying kernel parameters in the `/proc/sys` directory, ensuring they meet specified requirements for different network providers.
