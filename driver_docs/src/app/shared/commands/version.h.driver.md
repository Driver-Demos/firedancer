# Purpose
This code is a C header file that defines the interface for a version command within an application. It includes a function prototype for [`version_cmd_fn`](#version_cmd_fn), which likely handles the execution of the version command, taking arguments and configuration data as parameters. The file also declares an external variable `fd_action_version`, which is presumably used to represent or trigger the version action within the application. The inclusion of `fd_config.h` suggests that this header relies on configuration settings defined elsewhere. The use of include guards ensures that the file's contents are only included once during compilation, preventing redefinition errors.

### fd\_action\_version
- **Type**: `action_t`
- **Description**: The `fd_action_version` is a global variable of type `action_t`, which is likely a custom data type defined elsewhere in the codebase. It is declared as an external variable, indicating that it is defined in another source file and is accessible from this header file.
- **Use**: This variable is used to represent a specific action related to versioning, potentially as part of a command or operation in the application.
