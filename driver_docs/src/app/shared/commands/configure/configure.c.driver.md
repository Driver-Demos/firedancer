# Purpose
This C source code file is designed to handle the configuration process for a software system, likely named "Firedancer." It provides a structured approach to managing different configuration stages, such as initialization, checking, and finalization, through a command-line interface. The file defines several functions that parse command-line arguments, execute configuration commands, and verify the state of the system's configuration. The primary functions include [`configure_cmd_args`](#configure_cmd_args), which processes command-line arguments to determine the configuration command and stages; [`configure_cmd_perm`](#configure_cmd_perm), which manages permissions for configuration stages; and [`configure_stage`](#configure_stage), which executes the specified configuration command for each stage. Additionally, the file includes utility functions like [`check_path`](#check_path), [`check_dir`](#check_dir), and [`check_file`](#check_file) to verify the existence and properties of files and directories, ensuring they meet expected criteria.

The code is organized around a central theme of configuring a local host to run the Firedancer software correctly. It defines a public API through the `fd_action_configure` structure, which encapsulates the configuration action's name, argument processing function, execution function, permission management function, and a description of the action. This structure suggests that the code is part of a larger system where actions are modular and can be invoked based on user input. The file emphasizes error handling and logging, ensuring that any issues during the configuration process are reported clearly. The code is intended to be executed with elevated permissions, as it performs privileged operations like mounting filesystems, and it is recommended to be run as the root user for proper execution.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `configure.h`
- `errno.h`
- `sys/stat.h`


# Global Variables

---
### fd\_action\_configure
- **Type**: `action_t`
- **Description**: The `fd_action_configure` is a global variable of type `action_t` that represents a configuration action for the Firedancer application. It is initialized with specific function pointers and descriptions that define how the configuration command should be executed, including argument parsing, execution, and permission checking. The description and permission error messages provide guidance on the purpose of the configuration and the necessary permissions required to execute it.
- **Use**: This variable is used to define and execute the configuration process for setting up the local host to run Firedancer correctly, ensuring all necessary permissions and configurations are applied.


# Functions

---
### configure\_cmd\_args<!-- {{#callable:configure_cmd_args}} -->
The `configure_cmd_args` function processes command-line arguments to set up configuration commands and stages for a software configuration process.
- **Inputs**:
    - `pargc`: A pointer to an integer representing the number of command-line arguments.
    - `pargv`: A pointer to an array of strings representing the command-line arguments.
    - `args`: A pointer to an `args_t` structure where the parsed command and stages will be stored.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if the number of arguments is less than 2, and if so, log an error with usage information.
    - Determine the command type ('init', 'check', or 'fini') from the first argument and store it in `args->configure.command`.
    - Decrement the argument count and advance the argument pointer to process the stages.
    - Iterate over the remaining arguments to check if 'all' is specified, which sets all stages in `args->configure.stages` and exits the function.
    - If 'all' is not specified, iterate over the remaining arguments to match each with known stages, storing them in `args->configure.stages`.
    - Log an error if an unknown stage is encountered.
    - Decrement the argument count and advance the argument pointer for each processed stage.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value but modifies the `args` structure to reflect the parsed command and stages.


---
### configure\_cmd\_perm<!-- {{#callable:configure_cmd_perm}} -->
The `configure_cmd_perm` function manages permission-related operations for different configuration stages based on the command type (init, check, or fini).
- **Inputs**:
    - `args`: A pointer to an `args_t` structure containing configuration command and stages.
    - `chk`: A pointer to an `fd_cap_chk_t` structure used for capability checking.
    - `config`: A constant pointer to a `config_t` structure containing configuration settings.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Iterates over each configuration stage in `args->configure.stages`.
    - Switches based on the command type specified in `args->configure.command`.
    - For `CONFIGURE_CMD_INIT`, checks if the stage is enabled and if the configuration check does not return `CONFIGURE_OK`; if so, calls `init_perm` if it exists.
    - For `CONFIGURE_CMD_CHECK`, no operations are performed.
    - For `CONFIGURE_CMD_FINI`, checks if the stage is enabled and if the configuration check does not return `CONFIGURE_NOT_CONFIGURED`; if so, calls `fini_perm` if it exists.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it performs operations based on the configuration stages and command type.


---
### configure\_stage<!-- {{#callable:configure_stage}} -->
The `configure_stage` function manages the configuration process of a given stage based on the specified command and configuration settings.
- **Inputs**:
    - `stage`: A pointer to a `configure_stage_t` structure representing the stage to be configured.
    - `command`: A `configure_cmd_t` enumeration value indicating the command to execute (e.g., INIT, CHECK, FINI).
    - `config`: A constant pointer to a `config_t` structure containing configuration settings.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if the stage is enabled and skip configuration if it is not enabled.
    - Switch on the `command` to determine the action to perform: INIT, CHECK, or FINI.
    - For INIT, check the current configuration state and attempt to initialize the stage if it is not fully configured.
    - For CHECK, verify the configuration state and log warnings if the stage is not configured or partially configured.
    - For FINI, check the configuration state and attempt to finalize the stage, logging errors if the stage cannot be undone or is invalid.
- **Output**: Returns 0 on successful configuration or 1 if the stage is not configured correctly during a CHECK command.


---
### configure\_cmd\_fn<!-- {{#callable:configure_cmd_fn}} -->
The `configure_cmd_fn` function executes configuration commands on specified stages based on the provided command type, handling errors if any stage fails to configure.
- **Inputs**:
    - `args`: A pointer to an `args_t` structure containing the configuration command and stages to be processed.
    - `config`: A pointer to a `config_t` structure that holds configuration settings to be applied to each stage.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize an error flag to 0.
    - Check if the command is not `CONFIGURE_CMD_FINI`.
    - If not `CONFIGURE_CMD_FINI`, iterate over each stage in `args->configure.stages` and call [`configure_stage`](#configure_stage) with the current stage, command, and config.
    - If [`configure_stage`](#configure_stage) returns a non-zero value, set the error flag to 1.
    - If the command is `CONFIGURE_CMD_FINI`, count the number of stages in `args->configure.stages`.
    - If there are stages, iterate over them in reverse order and call [`configure_stage`](#configure_stage) with each stage, command, and config.
    - If [`configure_stage`](#configure_stage) returns a non-zero value, set the error flag to 1.
    - If the error flag is set, log an error message indicating that some stages failed to configure.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value but logs an error if any stage fails to configure.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`configure_stage`](#configure_stage)


---
### check\_path<!-- {{#callable:check_path}} -->
The `check_path` function verifies if a given path matches expected user ID, group ID, mode, and type (file or directory), returning a configuration result.
- **Inputs**:
    - `path`: A constant character pointer representing the file or directory path to be checked.
    - `expected_uid`: An unsigned integer representing the expected user ID of the path.
    - `expected_gid`: An unsigned integer representing the expected group ID of the path.
    - `expected_mode`: An unsigned integer representing the expected mode (permissions) of the path.
    - `expected_dir`: An integer indicating whether the path is expected to be a directory (non-zero) or a file (zero).
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function begins by declaring a `struct stat` variable `st` to hold file status information.
    - It attempts to retrieve the status of the path using `stat()`. If this fails, it checks if the error is due to the path not existing (`ENOENT`) and returns a partially configured result with an appropriate message.
    - If the path exists but the type does not match the expectation (file vs. directory), it returns a partially configured result with a message indicating the mismatch.
    - It then checks if the actual user ID (`st.st_uid`) matches the expected user ID, returning a partially configured result if they differ.
    - Similarly, it checks the group ID (`st.st_gid`) and mode (`st.st_mode`) against their expected values, returning a partially configured result if there are discrepancies.
    - If all checks pass, it calls `CONFIGURE_OK()` to indicate successful configuration.
- **Output**: The function returns a `configure_result_t` indicating whether the path is correctly configured or partially configured with an error message if any checks fail.


---
### check\_dir<!-- {{#callable:check_dir}} -->
The `check_dir` function verifies that a specified path is a directory with the expected user ID, group ID, and mode.
- **Inputs**:
    - `path`: A constant character pointer representing the path to the directory to be checked.
    - `uid`: An unsigned integer representing the expected user ID of the directory.
    - `gid`: An unsigned integer representing the expected group ID of the directory.
    - `mode`: An unsigned integer representing the expected mode (permissions) of the directory.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function calls [`check_path`](#check_path) with the provided `path`, `uid`, `gid`, `mode`, and a hardcoded value of `1` for `expected_dir`, indicating that the path should be a directory.
    - The [`check_path`](#check_path) function performs a `stat` system call on the path to retrieve its status information.
    - If the path does not exist, or if it is not a directory, or if its user ID, group ID, or mode do not match the expected values, the function returns a partially configured result with an appropriate error message.
    - If all checks pass, the function returns a configured OK result.
- **Output**: The function returns a `configure_result_t` indicating whether the directory at the specified path meets the expected criteria.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`check_path`](#check_path)


---
### check\_file<!-- {{#callable:check_file}} -->
The `check_file` function verifies the existence and attributes of a file at a specified path, ensuring it matches the expected user ID, group ID, and mode.
- **Inputs**:
    - `path`: A constant character pointer representing the file path to be checked.
    - `uid`: An unsigned integer representing the expected user ID of the file.
    - `gid`: An unsigned integer representing the expected group ID of the file.
    - `mode`: An unsigned integer representing the expected mode (permissions) of the file.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function calls [`check_path`](#check_path) with the provided `path`, `uid`, `gid`, and `mode`, along with an additional argument `0` to indicate that the path should be a file, not a directory.
- **Output**: The function returns a `configure_result_t` structure indicating the result of the file check, which includes whether the file exists and matches the expected attributes.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`check_path`](#check_path)
