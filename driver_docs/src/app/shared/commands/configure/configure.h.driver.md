# Purpose
This C header file, `configure.h`, is designed to facilitate the configuration management of a software system. It provides a structured approach to defining and executing configuration stages, which are represented by the `configure_stage_t` structure. Each stage includes function pointers for initialization, finalization, and checking the configuration status, allowing for modular and flexible configuration processes. The file defines several macros for handling configuration results, such as `CHECK`, `NOT_CONFIGURED`, `PARTIALLY_CONFIGURED`, and `CONFIGURE_OK`, which streamline error handling and status reporting during configuration operations.

The file also declares several external configuration stages, such as `fd_cfg_stage_hugetlbfs` and `fd_cfg_stage_sysctl`, which are likely implemented elsewhere and can be used to manage specific aspects of the system's configuration. Additionally, it provides function prototypes for checking directory and file configurations, as well as executing configuration commands. The `configure_args_t` structure and associated functions like [`configure_cmd_args`](#configure_cmd_args) and [`configure_cmd_perm`](#configure_cmd_perm) suggest that the file supports command-line argument parsing and permission management for configuration tasks. Overall, this header file serves as a central component for managing and executing configuration tasks within a larger software system, providing both the necessary data structures and function prototypes to support these operations.

### configure\_stage<!-- {{#callable_declaration:configure_stage}} -->
Executes a configuration command on a specified stage.
- **Description**: This function is used to execute a configuration command on a given stage, which can be initialization, checking, or finalization. It should be called with a valid stage and command, and a configuration object that provides the necessary context. The function handles different stages of configuration, ensuring that the stage is enabled and properly configured according to the command. It logs relevant messages and returns an integer status indicating success or specific conditions encountered during execution.
- **Inputs**:
    - `stage`: A pointer to a configure_stage_t structure representing the stage to be configured. Must not be null and should be properly initialized with valid function pointers for the operations to be performed.

- **Description**: This function processes command-line arguments to determine the configuration command and stages to be executed. It expects at least one argument specifying the command, which must be one of 'init', 'check', or 'fini'. If the command is valid, it updates the `args` structure with the corresponding command type. The function then processes additional arguments to identify configuration stages, which can be specified individually or as 'all' to include all available stages. The function modifies the argument count and vector to reflect unprocessed arguments. It should be called with valid pointers and a non-null `args` structure.

### configure\_cmd\_perm<!-- {{#callable_declaration:configure_cmd_perm}} -->
Configures permissions for each stage based on the command type.
- **Description**: This function iterates over a list of configuration stages and applies permission-related operations depending on the specified command type within the `args` structure. It should be used when you need to initialize or finalize permissions for configuration stages, as indicated by the command. The function expects valid pointers for `args`, `chk`, and `config`, and it assumes that the stages array in `args` is null-terminated. The function does not perform any operations for the `CONFIGURE_CMD_CHECK` command.
- **Inputs**:
    - `args`: A pointer to an `args_t` structure containing the command type and a null-terminated array of configuration stages. Must not be null.

### configure\_cmd\_fn<!-- {{#callable_declaration:configure_cmd_fn}} -->
Executes configuration commands on specified stages.
- **Description**: This function is used to execute a specified configuration command on a series of configuration stages. It should be called with valid arguments that specify the command to be executed and the stages to be configured. The function processes each stage in the order provided, unless the command is `CONFIGURE_CMD_FINI`, in which case it processes the stages in reverse order. It logs an error if any stage fails to configure properly. This function is typically used in scenarios where multiple configuration stages need to be initialized, checked, or finalized in a controlled sequence.
