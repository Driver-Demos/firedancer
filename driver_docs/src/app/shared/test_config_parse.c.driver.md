# Purpose
This C source code file is an executable program designed to test the parsing and validation of configuration data using the TOML (Tom's Obvious, Minimal Language) format. The code includes functionality to parse configuration strings, validate the parsed data, and ensure that the configuration adheres to expected structures and values. The main technical components include the use of a TOML parser (`fd_toml_parse`), a configuration extraction function (`fd_config_extract_pod`), and a validation function (`fd_config_validate`). The code also demonstrates the ability to handle default configurations and selectively override specific configuration fields while maintaining the integrity of other fields.

The program is structured to perform a series of tests on configuration data, ensuring that the parsing and validation processes work correctly. It uses static configuration strings and a default configuration to verify that the TOML parser can correctly interpret and extract configuration data into a structured format. The code also checks for the rejection of unrecognized configuration keys and validates that the default configuration can be parsed without errors. Additionally, it tests the ability to override specific configuration fields while preserving others, demonstrating the flexibility and robustness of the configuration handling logic. The program concludes by logging a success message and halting execution, indicating that all tests have passed successfully.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `fd_config_private.h`
- `../../ballet/toml/fd_toml.h`


# Global Variables

---
### cfg\_str\_1
- **Type**: ``char const[]``
- **Description**: The `cfg_str_1` variable is a static constant character array that contains a TOML configuration string. This string specifies a section labeled 'gossip' with a single entry point address '208.91.106.45:8080'.
- **Use**: This variable is used to provide a basic configuration string for parsing and testing within the main function.


---
### cfg\_str\_2
- **Type**: ``char const[]``
- **Description**: The `cfg_str_2` variable is a static constant character array that contains a TOML configuration string. It defines a single key-value pair where the key is 'wumbo' and the value is the string 'mini'.
- **Use**: This variable is used to test the parsing and rejection of unrecognized configuration keys in the TOML parsing process.


---
### fdctl\_default\_config
- **Type**: `uchar const[]`
- **Description**: The `fdctl_default_config` is an external constant array of unsigned characters that represents the default configuration data for the application. It is used in conjunction with `fdctl_default_config_sz`, which holds the size of this configuration data.
- **Use**: This variable is used to provide a default configuration that can be parsed and validated within the application.


---
### fdctl\_default\_config\_sz
- **Type**: `ulong`
- **Description**: The `fdctl_default_config_sz` is a global constant variable of type `ulong` that represents the size of the default configuration data used in the application. It is declared as an external variable, indicating that its definition is provided elsewhere, likely in a separate source file.
- **Use**: This variable is used to specify the size of the `fdctl_default_config` array when parsing the default configuration using the `fd_toml_parse` function.


# Functions

---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function initializes the application, parses configuration strings, validates configurations, and tests configuration overrides.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The count of command-line arguments passed to the program.
    - `argv`: An array of strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Call `fd_boot` to initialize the application with command-line arguments.
    - Allocate memory for a configuration pod and join it using `fd_pod_join`.
    - Parse a basic configuration string `cfg_str_1` using `fd_toml_parse` and verify its success with `FD_TEST`.
    - Extract the configuration from the pod into a `config_t` structure and verify the expected values using `FD_TEST`.
    - Reset the configuration and parse an unrecognized configuration string `cfg_str_2`, ensuring it fails to extract valid configuration.
    - Reset the configuration and parse the default configuration, ensuring it parses and validates successfully.
    - Modify the configuration to test selective field overrides, parse `cfg_str_1` again, and verify that only specific fields are overridden while others remain unchanged.
    - Log a success message and call `fd_halt` to terminate the application.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it performs configuration parsing and validation, logging success or terminating the process on failure.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`fd_config_extract_pod`](fd_config_parse.c.driver.md#fd_config_extract_pod)
    - [`fd_config_validate`](fd_config.c.driver.md#fd_config_validate)
