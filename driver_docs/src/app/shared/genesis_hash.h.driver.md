# Purpose
This C header file, `genesis_hash.h`, provides a specialized function for computing a "shred version" and a genesis hash from a specified file. The primary functionality is encapsulated in the [`compute_shred_version`](#compute_shred_version) function, which reads a file located at `genesis_path`, computes its SHA-256 hash using the functions provided by the included `fd_sha256` library, and then derives a shred version from this hash. The function is designed to handle file I/O errors gracefully, logging specific error messages if the file cannot be opened, read, or closed properly. The computed hash can optionally be stored in a user-provided buffer, `opt_gen_hash`.

The file is intended to be included in other C source files, as indicated by the use of include guards. It does not define a public API or external interface beyond the inline function it provides. The function is static and inline, suggesting it is meant for use within a limited scope, likely within a specific application or module that requires the computation of a shred version from a genesis file. The code leverages the `fd_sha256` library for cryptographic operations, ensuring that the hash computation is both efficient and secure.

### compute\_shred\_version<!-- {{#callable:compute_shred_version}} -->
The `compute_shred_version` function calculates a shred version and optionally outputs a genesis hash from a file specified by a path.
- **Inputs**:
    - `genesis_path`: A constant character pointer representing the file path to the genesis file.
    - `opt_gen_hash`: An optional unsigned character pointer where the computed genesis hash will be stored if provided.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize a SHA-256 context using `fd_sha256_new`, `fd_sha256_join`, and `fd_sha256_init`.
    - Open the file specified by `genesis_path` for reading.
    - If the file cannot be opened and the error is `ENOENT`, return 0; otherwise, log an error and exit.
    - Read the file in chunks of 4096 bytes, appending each chunk to the SHA-256 context using `fd_sha256_append`.
    - If a read error occurs, log an error and exit.
    - Close the file and log an error if closing fails.
    - Finalize the SHA-256 hash computation and store the result in a union of 32 bytes and 16 unsigned shorts.
    - If `opt_gen_hash` is provided, copy the 32-byte hash into it.
    - Compute the XOR of the 16 unsigned shorts from the hash.
    - Byte-swap the XOR result using `fd_ushort_bswap`.
    - Return the XOR result incremented by 1 if it is less than `USHORT_MAX`, otherwise return `USHORT_MAX`.
- **Output**: The function returns an unsigned short representing the computed shred version, which is derived from the XOR of the hash shorts.
