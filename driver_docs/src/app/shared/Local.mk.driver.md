# Purpose
The provided content is a segment of a Makefile, which is a build automation tool used to compile and link programs. This particular Makefile snippet is conditional, executing only if the macros `FD_HAS_HOSTED`, `FD_HAS_LINUX`, and `FD_HAS_INT128` are defined, indicating that the build is intended for a hosted environment on a Linux system with 128-bit integer support. The file uses custom functions like `make-lib`, `add-objs`, `make-unit-test`, and `make-fuzz-test` to manage the compilation and linking of various components into a shared library named `fdctl_shared`. It includes object files for configuration parsing, boot processes, and a series of command modules, each likely corresponding to different functionalities of the software. Additionally, it sets up unit and fuzz tests for the configuration parsing component, ensuring the reliability and robustness of the software's configuration handling capabilities.
