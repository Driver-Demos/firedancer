# Purpose
The provided C header file, `fd_config_private.h`, is designed to handle configuration management for an application. It defines a set of functions that facilitate the extraction, transformation, loading, and validation of configuration data. The file is intended to be included in other C source files, as indicated by the use of include guards to prevent multiple inclusions. The functions declared in this header are focused on processing configuration data, which is likely stored in a structured format such as a "pod" or a buffer, and converting it into a usable configuration structure (`config_t` or `fd_config_t`).

The key functions include [`fd_config_extract_pod`](#fd_config_extract_pod), which extracts configuration data from a given pod into a typed configuration structure, and [`fd_config_load_buf`](#fd_config_load_buf), which loads configuration data from a buffer. The [`fd_config_fill`](#fd_config_fill) function is responsible for transforming raw configuration data by filling in any missing fields, ensuring that the configuration is complete and ready for use. Finally, [`fd_config_validate`](#fd_config_validate) performs comprehensive validation of the configuration object, checking for completeness and correctness, and ensuring that all required options are provided and valid. The functions are not thread-safe and rely on global buffers, and they are designed to handle errors by logging messages and terminating the process if necessary. This header file is part of a broader configuration management system, providing essential functionality for managing application settings.
# Imports and Dependencies

- `fd_config.h`


# Global Variables

### fd\_config\_extract\_pod
- **Type**: `function pointer`
- **Description**: The `fd_config_extract_pod` is a function that extracts configuration data from a given pod and populates a typed configuration structure (`config_t`). It logs any errors encountered during the extraction process to a warning log and returns the populated configuration structure on success or NULL on error. The function is not thread-safe as it uses a global buffer.
- **Use**: This function is used to convert raw configuration data from a pod into a structured format for further processing.


# Function Declarations (Public API)

---
### fd\_config\_extract\_pod<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_config_extract_pod}} -->
Extracts configuration from a pod into a config structure.
- **Description**: Use this function to populate a `config_t` structure with configuration data extracted from a given pod. It logs any errors encountered during extraction to the warning log and returns the populated config structure on success. The function is not thread-safe as it uses a global buffer, and it does not zero-initialize the fields of the config structure before populating them. This function should be called when you need to convert pod data into a structured configuration format.
- **Inputs**:
    - `pod`: A pointer to an unsigned character array representing the pod from which configuration data is to be extracted. The pod must be properly formatted and non-null.
    - `config`: A pointer to a `config_t` structure where the extracted configuration will be stored. The caller must ensure this pointer is valid and that the structure is allocated before calling the function.
- **Output**: Returns a pointer to the populated `config_t` structure on success, or NULL if an error occurs during extraction.
- **See also**: [`fd_config_extract_pod`](fd_config_parse.c.driver.md#fd_config_extract_pod)  (Implementation)


---
### fd\_config\_load\_buf<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_config_load_buf}} -->
Loads configuration data from a buffer into a config structure.
- **Description**: This function is used to parse configuration data from a given buffer and load it into a provided configuration structure. It is typically called when configuration data is available in memory, such as when read from a file or received over a network. The function requires a valid buffer containing the configuration data in a specific format and a pre-allocated configuration structure to store the parsed data. It logs errors if parsing fails due to issues like buffer overflow or invalid data. The function is not thread-safe as it uses a global buffer.
- **Inputs**:
    - `out`: A pointer to a pre-allocated fd_config_t structure where the parsed configuration will be stored. The caller retains ownership and must ensure it is valid and large enough to hold the configuration data.
    - `buf`: A pointer to a constant character buffer containing the configuration data to be parsed. The buffer must be valid and contain data in the expected format.
    - `sz`: The size of the buffer in bytes. It must accurately reflect the size of the data in the buffer.
    - `path`: A pointer to a constant character string representing the path to the configuration file. This is used for logging purposes to indicate where errors occurred during parsing.
- **Output**: None
- **See also**: [`fd_config_load_buf`](fd_config.c.driver.md#fd_config_load_buf)  (Implementation)


---
### fd\_config\_fill<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_config_fill}} -->
Fills in missing fields in a configuration structure.
- **Description**: Use this function to populate a configuration structure with default values and derived settings based on the provided parameters. It should be called after loading a raw configuration to ensure all necessary fields are filled and consistent. The function will terminate the process with an error message if the configuration is invalid or if any required fields are missing. It is not thread-safe and should be used with caution in multi-threaded environments.
- **Inputs**:
    - `config`: A pointer to an fd_config_t structure that will be filled with configuration data. The caller must ensure this pointer is valid and points to a properly allocated structure.
    - `netns`: An integer indicating whether network namespace settings should be applied. Non-zero values enable network namespace configuration.
    - `is_local_cluster`: An integer indicating whether the configuration is for a local cluster. Non-zero values apply local cluster-specific settings.
- **Output**: None
- **See also**: [`fd_config_fill`](fd_config.c.driver.md#fd_config_fill)  (Implementation)


---
### fd\_config\_validate<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_config_validate}} -->
Validate the provided configuration object.
- **Description**: Use this function to ensure that a given configuration object is valid before proceeding with operations that depend on it. The function performs a comprehensive validation, checking for the presence of required options, the validity of string enumerations, non-overlapping ports, and valid paths, among other criteria. If any validation check fails, an error message is printed, and the process exits without returning. This function should be called after the configuration object has been fully populated and before it is used in any further processing.
- **Inputs**:
    - `config`: A pointer to a constant `fd_config_t` structure representing the configuration to be validated. The structure must be fully populated before calling this function. The caller retains ownership of the configuration object, and it must not be null.
- **Output**: None
- **See also**: [`fd_config_validate`](fd_config.c.driver.md#fd_config_validate)  (Implementation)
