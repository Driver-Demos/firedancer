# Purpose
This snippet is a Makefile configuration that conditionally compiles a binary named `fddbg` using the `make-bin` function if both `FD_HAS_HOSTED` and `FD_HAS_LINUX` are defined. It ensures that the build process for `fddbg` only occurs in environments that meet these specific conditions, likely indicating a hosted Linux environment.
