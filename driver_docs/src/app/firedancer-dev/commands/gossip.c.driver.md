# Purpose
This C source code file is designed to configure and manage a network topology for a system that appears to involve distributed components, likely in a high-performance computing or data center environment. The file includes several headers that suggest it is part of a larger software system, with dependencies on shared command modules, network configuration utilities, and CPU topology management. The primary functionality revolves around setting up and managing a "gossip" protocol, which is often used in distributed systems for communication and data dissemination among nodes. The code defines a series of functions that initialize and configure various components of the network topology, including metrics, gossip, and signing tiles, and establishes communication links between them.

The file is structured to be part of a larger application, likely serving as a module that can be invoked to perform specific actions related to network topology configuration and management. It defines an action, `fd_action_gossip`, which includes argument parsing, execution, and permission configuration functions. The code is not a standalone executable but rather a component that integrates into a broader system, providing specific functionality related to network topology setup and management. The use of external interfaces and configuration stages indicates that this file is part of a modular system, where different components can be configured and executed based on the system's requirements.

# Global Variables

---
### CALLBACKS
- **Type**: `fd_topo_obj_callbacks_t *`
- **Description**: CALLBACKS is an array of pointers to fd_topo_obj_callbacks_t structures, which are likely used to manage or interact with topology objects in the system. The use of 'extern' suggests that this variable is defined elsewhere, and it is shared across multiple source files.
- **Use**: CALLBACKS is used to pass callback functions to the fd_topob_finish function, which finalizes the topology setup.


---
### gossip\_cmd\_fn
- **Type**: `function pointer`
- **Description**: `gossip_cmd_fn` is a static function that serves as a command function for the 'gossip' action. It is responsible for setting up the network topology and initializing various system configurations and workspaces for the gossip protocol.
- **Use**: This function is used as the main execution function for the 'gossip' action, orchestrating the setup and execution of the gossip network topology.


---
### gossip\_cmd\_perm
- **Type**: `function`
- **Description**: `gossip_cmd_perm` is a static function that configures permissions for various stages of the system setup process. It uses the `configure_stage_perm` function to apply permission configurations for system control, huge pages, Ethernet tool channels, and generic receive offload stages.
- **Use**: This function is used to set up permissions for different configuration stages during the initialization of the gossip command.


---
### fd\_action\_gossip
- **Type**: `action_t`
- **Description**: The `fd_action_gossip` is a global variable of type `action_t` that represents an action named 'gossip'. It is initialized with specific function pointers and arguments related to the gossip command functionality.
- **Use**: This variable is used to define and execute the 'gossip' action, including its arguments, execution function, and permission checks.


# Functions

---
### gossip\_topo<!-- {{#callable:gossip_topo}} -->
The `gossip_topo` function initializes and configures the network topology for a gossip protocol using the provided configuration.
- **Inputs**:
    - `config`: A pointer to a `config_t` structure containing configuration settings for the network topology.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize a static array `tile_to_cpu` to map tiles to CPUs, though it is currently unused.
    - Set the network tile count in the configuration to 1.
    - Initialize CPU topology using `fd_topo_cpus_init`.
    - Reset the topology by creating a new topology object with `fd_topob_new`.
    - Set the maximum page size for shared memory based on the configuration.
    - Create workspaces for 'metric' and 'metric_in' and initialize a metric tile with Prometheus listen address and port.
    - Configure network tiles using `fd_topos_net_tiles` and find the network tile ID, logging an error if not found.
    - Set the gossip listen port for the network tile.
    - Create a workspace and tile for 'gossip', setting its identity key path, listen port, IP address, expected shred version, and entrypoints.
    - Check for missing entrypoints and expected shred version, logging errors if any are missing.
    - Create a workspace and tile for 'sign', setting its identity key path.
    - Create links and configure input/output for 'gossip_sign', 'sign_gossip', and 'gossip_net'.
    - Configure network receive links and tile inputs/outputs for 'gossip'.
    - Create a topology object for 'fseq' and associate it with the gossip tile.
    - Finalize the network tile configuration and perform automatic layout of the topology.
    - Set the affinity count to zero and finish the topology setup with callbacks.
    - Print the topology log to stdout.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it modifies the `config` structure to set up the network topology for gossip communication.


---
### gossip\_cmd\_args<!-- {{#callable:gossip_cmd_args}} -->
The `gossip_cmd_args` function is a placeholder function intended to handle command-line arguments for the gossip command, but currently does nothing.
- **Inputs**:
    - `pargc`: A pointer to an integer representing the number of command-line arguments.
    - `pargv`: A pointer to an array of strings representing the command-line arguments.
    - `args`: A pointer to an `args_t` structure, which is intended to hold parsed command-line arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function is defined as static, meaning it is limited to the file scope.
    - The function takes three parameters, all marked with `FD_PARAM_UNUSED`, indicating they are not used within the function body.
    - The function body is empty, indicating no operations are performed.
- **Output**: The function does not produce any output or return any value.


---
### configure\_stage\_perm<!-- {{#callable:configure_stage_perm}} -->
The `configure_stage_perm` function checks if a configuration stage is enabled and valid, and if so, initializes permissions for that stage.
- **Inputs**:
    - `stage`: A pointer to a `configure_stage_t` structure representing the configuration stage to be checked and potentially initialized.
    - `chk`: A pointer to an `fd_cap_chk_t` structure used for permission initialization.
    - `config`: A pointer to a `config_t` structure containing the configuration settings to be used for checking and initializing the stage.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Determine if the stage is enabled by checking if `stage->enabled` is NULL or returns true when called with `config`.
    - If the stage is enabled, check if the stage's configuration is valid by calling `stage->check(config)` and comparing the result to `CONFIGURE_OK`.
    - If the stage is enabled and the configuration check fails, call `stage->init_perm(chk, config)` to initialize permissions for the stage.
- **Output**: This function does not return a value; it performs actions based on the input parameters.


# Function Declarations (Public API)

---
### fdctl\_tile\_run<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fdctl_tile_run}} -->
Finds and returns a tile configuration by name.
- **Description**: Use this function to retrieve the configuration of a specific tile by its name from a predefined list of tiles. It is essential to ensure that the tile name provided exists in the list; otherwise, the function will log an error and return a default-initialized tile configuration. This function is typically used in scenarios where tile configurations need to be accessed dynamically based on their names.
- **Inputs**:
    - `tile`: A pointer to a constant `fd_topo_tile_t` structure representing the tile to be found. The `name` field of this structure is used to search for the corresponding tile configuration. The pointer must not be null, and the `name` field must be a valid string.
- **Output**: Returns an `fd_topo_run_tile_t` structure corresponding to the tile with the matching name. If no matching tile is found, logs an error and returns a default-initialized `fd_topo_run_tile_t`.
- **See also**: [`fdctl_tile_run`](../../shared/boot/fd_boot.c.driver.md#fdctl_tile_run)  (Implementation)
