# Purpose
This C source code file defines a function and a structure related to executing a development command within a larger application, likely related to blockchain or distributed systems given the context of a "validator." The function [`firedancer_dev_dev_cmd_fn`](#firedancer_dev_dev_cmd_fn) acts as a wrapper around the `dev_cmd_fn`, passing along arguments and configuration data, which suggests it is part of a command execution framework. The `fd_action_dev` structure is an instance of `action_t` that encapsulates metadata and behavior for the "dev" command, including its name, arguments, function pointer, permissions, and a description indicating its role in starting a development validator. This file is likely part of a modular system where commands are defined and registered for execution, facilitating development and testing environments.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `../../shared_dev/commands/dev.h`


# Global Variables

---
### fd\_action\_dev
- **Type**: `action_t`
- **Description**: The `fd_action_dev` is a global variable of type `action_t` that represents an action configuration for a development environment. It is initialized with specific parameters such as a name, arguments, a function pointer, permissions, a flag indicating it is for a local cluster, and a description. This configuration is likely used to define and execute a specific command or action related to starting a development validator.
- **Use**: This variable is used to configure and execute a development-related command within the application.


# Functions

---
### firedancer\_dev\_dev\_cmd\_fn<!-- {{#callable:firedancer_dev_dev_cmd_fn}} -->
The function `firedancer_dev_dev_cmd_fn` is a wrapper that calls the `dev_cmd_fn` function with the provided arguments and a NULL value.
- **Inputs**:
    - `args`: A pointer to an `args_t` structure containing command-line arguments or other relevant data for the command.
    - `config`: A pointer to a `config_t` structure containing configuration settings for the command.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function `firedancer_dev_dev_cmd_fn` is called with two parameters: `args` and `config`.
    - It then calls the `dev_cmd_fn` function, passing `args`, `config`, and a NULL value as arguments.
- **Output**: This function does not return any value; it is a void function.
