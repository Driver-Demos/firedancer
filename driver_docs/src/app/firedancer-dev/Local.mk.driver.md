# Purpose
The provided content is a segment from a Makefile, which is used to automate the build process of a software project. This particular section is conditional, meaning it checks for the presence of certain features or libraries (such as Linux, SSE, ZSTD, and others) before proceeding with the build process. If all conditions are met, it defines a target named `firedancer-dev`, which involves compiling various components and linking them into a binary. The `add-objs` function is used to add object files from specified directories to the build, and `make-bin` is used to create the executable, linking it with necessary libraries like SECP256K1, ROCKSDB, and OpenSSL. If the required conditions are not met, a warning is issued indicating that the build for `firedancer-dev` is disabled due to the absence of the ZSTD library.
