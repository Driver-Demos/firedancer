# Purpose
The provided C header file, `fd_cap_chk.h`, defines a set of functions and data structures for checking and managing process capabilities and permissions in a Linux environment. It is designed to be included in other C source files, providing a mechanism to verify if a process has the necessary permissions or capabilities to perform certain operations. The file defines a private structure `fd_cap_chk_t` and several functions that allow a program to check if it is running with root privileges, specific Linux capabilities, or sufficient resource limits. If any of these checks fail, the system accumulates error information that can be retrieved and reported later.

The header file offers a clear API for capability checking, with functions like [`fd_cap_chk_root`](#fd_cap_chk_root), [`fd_cap_chk_cap`](#fd_cap_chk_cap), and [`fd_cap_chk_raise_rlimit`](#fd_cap_chk_raise_rlimit) to perform specific checks. These functions do not return errors directly; instead, they log errors and terminate the program if there are environmental issues preventing the checks. The file also provides utility functions to manage and query the accumulated errors, such as [`fd_cap_chk_err_cnt`](#fd_cap_chk_err_cnt) and [`fd_cap_chk_err`](#fd_cap_chk_err), which allow the caller to retrieve the number of errors and the specific error messages. This design ensures that the program can handle capability-related issues robustly and informatively, making it suitable for applications that require strict permission management.

# Data Structures

---
### fd\_cap\_chk\_t
- **Type**: `typedef struct fd_cap_chk_private fd_cap_chk_t;`
- **Members**:
    - `fd_cap_chk_private`: An opaque structure used internally to manage capability checking and error accumulation.
- **Description**: The `fd_cap_chk_t` is a typedef for an opaque structure `fd_cap_chk_private` that provides mechanisms to check the capabilities or permissions available to the caller. It accumulates error information if required capabilities are missing, which can be reported later. The structure is designed to ensure that functions do not return errors or fail silently; instead, they log errors and terminate if there are issues retrieving correct information. This data structure is used in conjunction with various functions to check for root user status, specific Linux capabilities, and resource limits, accumulating errors when necessary.

# Function Declarations (Public API)

---
### fd\_cap\_chk\_new<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_cap_chk_new}} -->
Initialize a capability checker in shared memory.
- **Description**: This function initializes a capability checker object in the provided shared memory region. It is used to set up the capability checker before performing any capability checks. The function must be called with a valid shared memory pointer that is properly aligned and has sufficient space to accommodate the capability checker structure. This function does not perform any error checking on the input and assumes the caller has ensured the preconditions are met.
- **Inputs**:
    - `shmem`: A pointer to a shared memory region where the capability checker will be initialized. The memory must be aligned to FD_CAP_CHK_ALIGN and have at least FD_CAP_CHK_FOOTPRINT bytes available. The caller retains ownership of the memory and must ensure it is valid and properly aligned.
- **Output**: Returns a pointer to the initialized capability checker object within the shared memory.
- **See also**: [`fd_cap_chk_new`](fd_cap_chk.c.driver.md#fd_cap_chk_new)  (Implementation)


---
### fd\_cap\_chk\_join<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_cap_chk_join}} -->
Converts a shared memory pointer to a capability checker handle.
- **Description**: Use this function to obtain a handle to a capability checker from a shared memory pointer. This is typically done after allocating or initializing the capability checker in shared memory. The function does not perform any validation on the input pointer, so it is the caller's responsibility to ensure that the pointer is valid and correctly aligned. This function is intended to be used in environments where the capability checker is shared across different parts of a program or between different programs.
- **Inputs**:
    - `shchk`: A pointer to shared memory that is expected to contain a capability checker. The pointer must be valid and correctly aligned according to the requirements of the capability checker. The caller retains ownership of the memory, and the function does not check for null or invalid pointers.
- **Output**: Returns a pointer to an fd_cap_chk_t structure, which serves as a handle to the capability checker.
- **See also**: [`fd_cap_chk_join`](fd_cap_chk.c.driver.md#fd_cap_chk_join)  (Implementation)


---
### fd\_cap\_chk\_root<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_cap_chk_root}} -->
Checks if the current process is running as the root user.
- **Description**: Use this function to verify if the current process has root user privileges. It is typically called when a process requires elevated permissions to perform certain operations. If the process is not running as root, an error entry is added to the capability checker with a formatted message using the provided name and reason. This function does not return errors or fail silently; it logs an error and terminates if it encounters an environment issue.
- **Inputs**:
    - `chk`: A pointer to an fd_cap_chk_t structure used to accumulate error information. Must not be null.
    - `name`: A constant string used to identify the operation or context in the error message. Must not be null.
    - `reason`: A constant string providing the reason for requiring root privileges, used in the error message. Must not be null.
- **Output**: None
- **See also**: [`fd_cap_chk_root`](fd_cap_chk.c.driver.md#fd_cap_chk_root)  (Implementation)


---
### fd\_cap\_chk\_cap<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_cap_chk_cap}} -->
Checks if the current process has a specified Linux capability and logs an error if it does not.
- **Description**: Use this function to verify that the current process possesses a specific Linux capability required for its operation. If the capability is missing, the function logs an error message with a specified name and reason into the provided capability checker object. This function is typically called multiple times to check for various required capabilities before proceeding with operations that depend on them. It does not return errors or fail silently; instead, it accumulates error information for later reporting.
- **Inputs**:
    - `chk`: A pointer to an fd_cap_chk_t object where error information will be accumulated. Must not be null.
    - `name`: A string used to identify the capability check in error messages. Must not be null.
    - `capability`: An unsigned integer representing the Linux capability to check. Valid capabilities are those recognized by the system.
    - `reason`: A string describing the reason for requiring the capability, used in error messages. Must not be null.

---
### fd\_cap\_chk\_raise\_rlimit<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_cap_chk_raise_rlimit}} -->
Checks and potentially raises a resource limit for the current process.
- **Description**: This function checks if the current process has a specified resource limit, identified by a RLIMIT_* constant, at or above a desired threshold. If the limit is below the threshold, the function attempts to raise it, provided the process has the necessary capabilities, such as CAP_SYS_RESOURCE. If the resource is RLIMIT_NICE, the function also considers CAP_SYS_NICE as sufficient. If the limit cannot be raised due to insufficient capabilities, an error entry is recorded in the provided capability checker. This function should be used when a process requires certain resource limits to be met and should be called after initializing the capability checker.
- **Inputs**:
    - `chk`: A pointer to an fd_cap_chk_t structure used to accumulate error information. Must not be null.
    - `name`: A string used to identify the resource in error messages. Must not be null.
    - `resource`: An integer representing a RLIMIT_* constant that specifies the resource limit to check.
    - `limit`: An unsigned long specifying the desired limit for the resource.
    - `reason`: A string providing the reason for the check, used in error messages. Must not be null.
- **Output**: None
- **See also**: [`fd_cap_chk_raise_rlimit`](fd_cap_chk.c.driver.md#fd_cap_chk_raise_rlimit)  (Implementation)


---
### fd\_cap\_chk\_err\_cnt<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_cap_chk_err_cnt}} -->
Return the number of error entries accumulated in the capability checker.
- **Description**: Use this function to retrieve the count of errors that have been accumulated by the capability checker. This is typically called after performing a series of capability checks to determine if any errors were recorded. It is important to ensure that the `chk` parameter is a valid pointer to an `fd_cap_chk_t` structure before calling this function.
- **Inputs**:
    - `chk`: A pointer to a constant `fd_cap_chk_t` structure. This must not be null and should point to a valid capability checker instance. If the pointer is invalid, the behavior is undefined.
- **Output**: Returns the number of error entries as an unsigned long integer.
- **See also**: [`fd_cap_chk_err_cnt`](fd_cap_chk.c.driver.md#fd_cap_chk_err_cnt)  (Implementation)


---
### fd\_cap\_chk\_err<!-- {{#callable_declaration:fd_cap_chk_err}} -->
Returns the error message at the specified index.
- **Description**: Use this function to retrieve a specific error message that has been accumulated in the capability checker. It is typically called after performing capability checks to understand what errors, if any, have occurred. The index provided must be less than the total number of errors, which can be obtained using `fd_cap_chk_err_cnt()`. This function does not perform bounds checking on the index, so it is the caller's responsibility to ensure the index is valid.
- **Inputs**:
    - `chk`: A pointer to a `fd_cap_chk_t` structure that contains accumulated error information. Must not be null.
    - `idx`: An unsigned long integer representing the index of the error message to retrieve. Must be less than the number of errors accumulated, as returned by `fd_cap_chk_err_cnt()`.
