# Purpose
This C source code file defines a set of macros designed to facilitate the extraction and management of configuration values from a data structure referred to as a "pod." The macros, such as `CFG_POP`, `CFG_POP1`, `CFG_POP_ARRAY`, and `CFG_POP1_ARRAY`, provide a streamlined way to query, validate, and remove configuration data from the pod, which is likely a structured data container. These macros are intended to be used in conjunction with a configuration object, `config`, and they rely on functions like `fd_pod_query`, `fdctl_cfg_get_##type`, and `fd_pod_remove` to perform their operations. The macros handle both single configuration values and arrays of values, ensuring that the extracted data is correctly typed and sized according to the configuration structure.

The code is not a standalone executable but rather a utility intended to be included in other C source files. It provides a narrow but essential functionality focused on configuration management, specifically for applications that utilize a pod-based configuration system. The macros abstract away the repetitive tasks of querying and validating configuration data, thus promoting code reuse and reducing potential errors in configuration handling. The use of macros allows for flexible type handling, as indicated by the `type` parameter, which is resolved at compile time. This file does not define public APIs or external interfaces directly but provides internal mechanisms that can be leveraged by other components of a larger software system.
