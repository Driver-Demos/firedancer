# Purpose
This C source code file provides functionality for checking and managing process capabilities and resource limits in a Linux environment. It is designed to be part of a larger system, likely a library, that deals with system-level permissions and constraints. The file defines a set of functions that allow for the creation and management of a capability check structure (`fd_cap_chk_t`), which tracks errors related to insufficient capabilities or resource limits. The primary operations include checking if a process has root privileges, verifying specific capabilities, and attempting to raise resource limits if necessary. The code also includes mechanisms for logging errors when capability checks fail or when resource limits cannot be adjusted.

The file includes several key components: a private structure to store error messages, functions to initialize and manage this structure, and utility functions to check capabilities and resource limits. It uses Linux-specific system calls and structures, such as `syscall` for `capget` and `getrlimit`/`setrlimit` for resource limits, indicating its reliance on Linux kernel features. The code also provides string representations for various capabilities and resource limits, enhancing the readability of error messages. This file does not define a public API but rather serves as an internal component of a larger system, focusing on ensuring that processes have the necessary permissions to perform certain operations.

# Data Structures

---
### fd\_cap\_chk\_private
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `err_cnt`: A counter that tracks the number of errors recorded.
    - `err`: An array of strings storing error messages, with each message having a maximum length defined by MAX_ERROR_MSG_LEN.
- **Description**: The `fd_cap_chk_private` structure is used to manage and store error information related to capability checks in a system. It maintains a count of errors encountered (`err_cnt`) and an array of error messages (`err`) that can store up to `MAX_ERROR_ENTRIES` messages, each with a length of `MAX_ERROR_MSG_LEN`. This structure is integral to the error handling mechanism of the capability checking process, allowing for the accumulation and retrieval of error messages.


# Functions

---
### fd\_cap\_chk\_add\_error<!-- {{#callable:fd_cap_chk_add_error}} -->
The `fd_cap_chk_add_error` function logs formatted error messages into a capability check structure, ensuring the error count does not exceed a predefined limit.
- **Inputs**:
    - `chk`: A pointer to an `fd_cap_chk_t` structure where the error message will be stored.
    - `fmt`: A format string similar to `printf` that specifies how the error message should be formatted.
    - `...`: A variable number of arguments that are used in conjunction with the format string to create the error message.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if the current error count in `chk` has reached the maximum allowed (`MAX_ERROR_ENTRIES`); if so, log an error and terminate the program.
    - Initialize a `va_list` to handle the variable arguments passed to the function.
    - Use `vsnprintf` to format the error message and store it in the next available slot in the `chk->err` array, incrementing the error count afterwards.
    - Check if `vsnprintf` returned a negative value, indicating an error, and log an error if so.
    - Check if the formatted message was truncated by comparing the result of `vsnprintf` to `MAX_ERROR_MSG_LEN`; log an error if truncation occurred.
    - End the use of the `va_list` with `va_end`.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it logs errors directly to the `chk` structure or terminates the program if critical errors occur.


---
### fd\_cap\_chk\_new<!-- {{#callable:fd_cap_chk_new}} -->
The `fd_cap_chk_new` function initializes a capability check structure by setting its error count to zero and returns a pointer to the initialized structure.
- **Inputs**:
    - `shmem`: A pointer to a shared memory region where the capability check structure (`fd_cap_chk_t`) is located.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Cast the input `shmem` pointer to a `fd_cap_chk_t` pointer named `chk`.
    - Set the `err_cnt` field of the `chk` structure to zero, initializing the error count.
    - Return the `chk` pointer, which now points to the initialized capability check structure.
- **Output**: A pointer to the initialized `fd_cap_chk_t` structure.


---
### fd\_cap\_chk\_join<!-- {{#callable:fd_cap_chk_join}} -->
The `fd_cap_chk_join` function casts a given pointer to a `fd_cap_chk_t` type and returns it.
- **Inputs**:
    - `shchk`: A pointer to a memory location that is expected to be of type `fd_cap_chk_t`.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function takes a single argument, `shchk`, which is a void pointer.
    - It casts the `shchk` pointer to a `fd_cap_chk_t` pointer type.
    - The function returns the casted pointer.
- **Output**: A pointer of type `fd_cap_chk_t` that points to the same memory location as the input `shchk`.


---
### fd\_cap\_chk\_root<!-- {{#callable:fd_cap_chk_root}} -->

    - `chk`: A pointer to an `fd_cap_chk_t` structure where errors are logged.
    - `name`: A string representing the name of the process or operation requiring root access.

- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if the current user ID is zero (indicating root user) using `getuid()`.
    - If the user ID is zero, return immediately as no error needs to be logged.
    - If the user ID is not zero, call [`fd_cap_chk_add_error`](#fd_cap_chk_add_error) to log an error message indicating that root access is required.
- **Output**: The function does not return any value; it logs an error message to the `fd_cap_chk_t` structure if the process is not running as root.

- **Inputs**:
    - `capability`: An unsigned integer representing the capability to check for.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize a `__user_cap_data_struct` array `capdata` to store capability data.

    - `reason`: A constant character string providing the reason for raising the resource limit, used in error messages.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Convert the `_resource` integer to `fd_rlimit_res_t` type and store it in `resource`.
    - Retrieve the current resource limits using `getrlimit` and store them in `rlim`; log an error if this fails.
    - If the current limit (`rlim.rlim_cur`) is already greater than or equal to the desired `limit`, return immediately.
