# Purpose
The provided content is from a Makefile, which is used to automate the build process of a software project. This Makefile snippet defines the compilation and linking instructions for various components of a project, specifically focusing on a protocol-agnostic component named `fdctl_platform`. It utilizes macros such as `make-lib`, `add-hdrs`, and `add-objs` to manage the inclusion of header files and object files, ensuring that dependencies like `fd_config_extract`, `fd_cap_chk`, `fd_sys_util`, `fd_net_util`, and `fd_file_util` are correctly compiled and linked with the `fdctl_platform` library. This setup facilitates modular development by organizing system utilities and configuration parsing utilities, which are essential for the functionality of the `fdctl_platform`.
