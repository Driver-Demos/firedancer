# Purpose
This file is a Makefile snippet that defines and exports versioning information for the "Firedancer" software, including major, minor, and patch version numbers. It also captures the current Git commit hash using a shell command, which is stored in the `FIREDANCER_CI_COMMIT` variable. These variables are exported for use in other parts of the build process or scripts.
