# Purpose
This code is a C header file that defines the interface for initializing a topology in the context of the FireDancer application. It includes a shared configuration header file, `fd_config.h`, suggesting that it relies on some shared configuration settings or structures. The file declares a single function, [`fd_topo_initialize`](#fd_topo_initialize), which takes a pointer to a `config_t` structure as its parameter, indicating that it initializes the topology based on the provided configuration. The use of include guards (`#ifndef`, `#define`, `#endif`) ensures that the header is only included once during compilation, preventing potential redefinition errors. The `FD_PROTOTYPES_BEGIN` and `FD_PROTOTYPES_END` macros likely manage the scope or linkage of the function prototypes, possibly for compatibility or namespace management.
