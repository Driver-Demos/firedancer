# Purpose
This code is a C source file that includes a utility header and imports a binary configuration file. It utilizes a macro `FD_IMPORT_BINARY` from the included `fd_util.h` header to embed the contents of a TOML configuration file, `default.toml`, into the program as a binary resource. The purpose of this file is to make the default configuration for the "firedancer" application available at compile time, allowing the application to access its configuration settings directly from the binary without needing to read from an external file at runtime. This approach can enhance performance and simplify deployment by reducing external dependencies.
