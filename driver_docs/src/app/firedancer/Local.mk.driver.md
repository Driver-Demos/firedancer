# Purpose
The provided content is a Makefile script used in the build process of a software project named "firedancer." This script primarily manages the generation and updating of version information for the project. It includes commands to create a header file, `version2.h`, which defines macros for the major, minor, and patch version numbers, as well as the commit reference of the current build. The script ensures that the `version.h` file is updated only if there are changes in the version information, thereby optimizing the build process. Additionally, the script includes conditional compilation directives to check for the presence of certain features or libraries, such as threading and specific hardware instructions, which are necessary for building the "firedancer" application. If these conditions are not met, the build process is disabled, and a warning is issued. The script also defines targets for compiling and linking various components of the "firedancer" application, ensuring that all necessary dependencies are included.
