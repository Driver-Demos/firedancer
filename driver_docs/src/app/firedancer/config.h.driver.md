# Purpose
This code is a simple C header file that provides declarations for external variables related to the Firedancer application configuration. It includes a utility header file, `fd_util.h`, which likely contains common definitions or functions used across the application. The file declares two external variables: `firedancer_default_config`, a constant unsigned character array, and `firedancer_default_config_sz`, a constant unsigned long, which presumably represent the default configuration data and its size, respectively. The use of include guards ensures that the header's contents are only included once in a compilation unit, preventing redefinition errors.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `../../util/fd_util.h`


# Global Variables

---
### firedancer\_default\_config
- **Type**: `uchar const[]`
- **Description**: The `firedancer_default_config` is an external constant array of unsigned characters, representing the default configuration for the Firedancer application. This array is likely used to store configuration data in a binary or encoded format.
- **Use**: This variable is used to provide a default configuration setup for the Firedancer application, which can be accessed globally throughout the program.


---
### firedancer\_default\_config\_sz
- **Type**: `ulong`
- **Description**: The variable `firedancer_default_config_sz` is a global constant of type `ulong` that represents the size of the default configuration for the Firedancer application. It is declared as an external variable, indicating that its definition is located in another source file.
- **Use**: This variable is used to determine the size of the `firedancer_default_config` array, which holds the default configuration data for the application.
