## Folders
- **[epoch](choreo/epoch.driver.md)**: The `epoch` folder in the `firedancer` codebase contains source and header files for managing epoch structures and their associated operations, along with a makefile for conditional compilation settings.
- **[eqvoc](choreo/eqvoc.driver.md)**: The `eqvoc` folder in the `firedancer` codebase contains source code and build instructions for managing and verifying Forward Error Correction (FEC) and equivocation proofs, including implementation files (`fd_eqvoc.c` and `fd_eqvoc.h`), a build configuration file (`Local.mk`), and a test suite (`test_eqvoc.c`) for ensuring data integrity and authenticity in distributed systems.
- **[forks](choreo/forks.driver.md)**: The `forks` folder in the `firedancer` codebase contains source code and build instructions for managing fork structures and operations within a blockchain context, including files for defining and implementing fork management functions, as well as a test program for the `fd_forks` system.
- **[ghost](choreo/ghost.driver.md)**: The `ghost` folder in the `firedancer` codebase contains source code and build instructions for implementing and testing the LMD-GHOST fork choice rule and related data structures, including files for managing, manipulating, and validating a tree of nodes representing blockchain slots.
- **[tower](choreo/tower.driver.md)**: The `tower` folder in the `firedancer` codebase contains source code and build configurations for implementing and testing Solana's TowerBFT algorithm, which manages voting operations and consensus mechanisms.
- **[voter](choreo/voter.driver.md)**: The `voter` folder in the `firedancer` codebase contains source files and build instructions for managing and testing voter states, including functions for state retrieval, serialization, and validation, as well as a control file for encoding vote account addresses.

## Files
- **[fd_choreo.h](choreo/fd_choreo.h.driver.md)**: The `fd_choreo.h` file serves as a header file in the `firedancer` codebase, including various module headers such as `fd_choreo_base.h`, `fd_epoch.h`, `fd_eqvoc.h`, `fd_forks.h`, `fd_ghost.h`, `fd_tower.h`, and `fd_voter.h`.
- **[fd_choreo_base.h](choreo/fd_choreo_base.h.driver.md)**: The `fd_choreo_base.h` file in the `firedancer` codebase defines constants and macros for the Choreo consensus library, including block and vote equivocation, fork choice rules, and the TowerBFT algorithm.
- **[Local.mk](choreo/Local.mk.driver.md)**: The `Local.mk` file in the `firedancer` codebase is a makefile that conditionally builds the `fd_choreo` library and its associated headers and unit tests if `FD_HAS_INT128` is defined.
- **[test_choreo_base.c](choreo/test_choreo_base.c.driver.md)**: The `test_choreo_base.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase contains a simple test program that initializes and halts the `fd_choreo` system.
