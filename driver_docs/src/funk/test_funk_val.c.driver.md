# Purpose
This C source code file is designed to perform unit testing on a transactional data management system, specifically focusing on the functionality provided by the "fd_funk" library. The code is structured to execute a series of operations that simulate transaction management, including preparing, inserting, removing, publishing, and canceling transactions. It utilizes a workspace for memory management, which can be either attached to an existing workspace or created as an anonymous local workspace. The code is highly parameterized, allowing various aspects of the test environment to be configured via command-line arguments, such as workspace name, page size, transaction limits, and verbosity.

The main technical components of this file include the initialization and management of a random number generator, the setup and teardown of a workspace, and the creation and manipulation of transactions and records within the "fd_funk" framework. The code is structured to handle both hosted and non-hosted environments, with the main functionality only executing if hosted capabilities are available. The file is intended to be compiled and executed as a standalone program, as indicated by the presence of a [`main`](#main) function, and it does not define public APIs or external interfaces. The primary purpose of this code is to validate the correctness and robustness of the "fd_funk" library's transaction handling capabilities through rigorous testing.
# Imports and Dependencies

- `fd_funk.h`
- `test_funk_common.h`


# Functions

---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function initializes the environment and logs a warning if the FD_HAS_HOSTED capabilities are not available, then halts the program.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: An integer representing the number of command-line arguments.
    - `argv`: An array of strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Call `fd_boot` to initialize the environment with command-line arguments.
    - Log a warning message indicating that the unit test requires FD_HAS_HOSTED capabilities.
    - Call `fd_halt` to terminate the program.
    - Return 0 to indicate successful execution.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer value of 0, indicating successful execution.
