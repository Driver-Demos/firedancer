# Purpose
The provided content is from a Makefile, which is a build automation tool used to manage the build process of software projects. This specific section of the Makefile is responsible for defining and executing unit tests for various components of a software module named "fd_funk." The `ifdef FD_HAS_ATOMIC` and `ifdef FD_HAS_HOSTED` directives are conditional statements that ensure certain tests and build steps are only executed if specific conditions or features are available. The `$(call add-hdrs,...)` and `$(call add-objs,...)` functions are used to include necessary header files and object files for the build process. The `$(call make-unit-test,...)` and `$(call run-unit-test,...)` functions are used to create and execute unit tests for different parts of the "fd_funk" module, ensuring that each component functions correctly and meets the required specifications.
