# Purpose
This C++ source code file is a test program designed to validate the functionality and concurrency handling of a transactional record management system, likely part of a larger database or data management library. The code utilizes multiple threads to perform operations on records within transactions, ensuring that the system can handle concurrent modifications safely and correctly. The main components of the code include the setup of a shared workspace, initialization of records with default values, and the creation of multiple threads that perform operations such as cloning, querying, and modifying records within transactions. The use of atomic operations and checks ensures that the operations are performed safely in a concurrent environment.

The code is structured around a main function that initializes the environment and a worker thread function that performs the core operations on the records. The main function sets up the necessary data structures and spawns multiple threads to execute the [`work_thread`](#work_thread) function, which performs a series of operations on records, including cloning, querying, and modifying them. The code uses a combination of custom data structures and functions, such as `fd_funk_t`, `fd_funk_txn_t`, and various `fd_funk_rec_*` functions, to manage transactions and records. The test concludes by verifying that the expected values match the actual values in the records, ensuring that the transactional operations were executed correctly without race conditions. This file is primarily intended for testing and validation purposes rather than providing a public API or external interface.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `fd_funk_rec.h`
- `fd_funk_txn.h`
- `test_funk_common.hpp`
- `cstdio`
- `pthread.h`


# Global Variables

---
### exp\_val
- **Type**: `uint`
- **Description**: The `exp_val` variable is a static volatile array of unsigned integers with a size defined by the constant `NUM_KEYS`. It is initialized with zeros and is used to keep track of expected values for each key in a concurrent transaction processing system.
- **Use**: This variable is used to store and update the expected values for each key during the execution of multiple threads, ensuring that the values are incremented atomically.


# Data Structures

---
### test\_funk\_txn\_pair<!-- {{#data_structure:test_funk_txn_pair}} -->
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `funk`: A pointer to an fd_funk_t structure, representing a funk instance.
    - `txn`: A pointer to an fd_funk_txn_t structure, representing a transaction instance.
- **Description**: The `test_funk_txn_pair` structure is a simple data structure that holds a pair of pointers, one to an `fd_funk_t` instance and another to an `fd_funk_txn_t` instance. This structure is used to pass both a funk instance and its associated transaction together, facilitating operations that require both components, such as in multi-threaded transaction processing scenarios.


---
### test\_funk\_txn\_pair\_t<!-- {{#data_structure:test_funk_txn_pair_t}} -->
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `funk`: A pointer to an fd_funk_t structure, representing the main data structure for managing records and transactions.
    - `txn`: A pointer to an fd_funk_txn_t structure, representing a specific transaction within the funk system.
- **Description**: The `test_funk_txn_pair_t` structure is a simple compound data type that encapsulates a pair of pointers: one to an `fd_funk_t` structure and another to an `fd_funk_txn_t` structure. This pairing is used to associate a transaction (`txn`) with its corresponding funk system (`funk`), facilitating operations that require both the context of the funk and the specific transaction being processed. This structure is particularly useful in multithreaded environments where multiple transactions are processed concurrently, as seen in the provided code where it is used to pass data to worker threads.


# Functions

---
### work\_thread<!-- {{#callable:work_thread}} -->
The `work_thread` function performs transactional operations on records, modifying their values in a concurrent environment.
- **Inputs**:
    - `arg`: A pointer to a `test_funk_txn_pair_t` structure containing a `fd_funk_t` pointer and a `fd_funk_txn_t` pointer.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Cast the input argument to a `test_funk_txn_pair_t` pointer to access the `funk` and `txn` objects.
    - Iterate 1024 times, each time selecting a random key index within the range of `NUM_KEYS`.
    - Initialize a `fd_funk_rec_key_t` structure with the selected key index.
    - Attempt to clone the record associated with the key from the ancestor transaction using [`fd_funk_rec_try_clone_safe`](fd_funk_rec.c.driver.md#fd_funk_rec_try_clone_safe).
    - Query the record to ensure it exists for the current transaction using [`fd_funk_rec_query_try`](fd_funk_rec.c.driver.md#fd_funk_rec_query_try) and verify its existence with `FD_TEST`.
    - Modify the record by querying it with [`fd_funk_rec_modify`](fd_funk_rec.c.driver.md#fd_funk_rec_modify), verify the modification with `FD_TEST`, and increment its value by 1.
    - Publish the modified record using [`fd_funk_rec_modify_publish`](fd_funk_rec.c.driver.md#fd_funk_rec_modify_publish).
    - Atomically increment the expected value for the key index in the `exp_val` array.
- **Output**: Returns `NULL` after completing the operations.

### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function initializes a shared memory workspace, sets up records with initial values, performs multiple transactions with concurrent threads modifying records, and verifies the correctness of the operations.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The number of command-line arguments.
    - `argv`: An array of command-line arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize random number generator with a fixed seed for reproducibility.
    - Call `fd_boot` to initialize the environment with command-line arguments.
    - Set up shared memory workspace using `fd_wksp_new_anonymous` and allocate memory for `fd_funk` operations.
    - Initialize `fd_funk` structure with allocated memory and prepare records with initial values set to 0.
    - Iterate over a maximum transaction count (`MAX_TXN_CNT`) to perform transactions.
    - For each transaction, prepare a new transaction and occasionally skip adding records to test global querying logic.
    - Create multiple threads (`NUM_THREADS`) to perform concurrent operations on records within each transaction.
    - Each thread modifies records by incrementing their values and updates the expected values array (`exp_val`).
    - After threads complete, query and verify that the record values match the expected values to ensure atomicity and correctness.
    - Log a success message if all tests pass.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value but logs a success message if all operations are verified to be correct.
