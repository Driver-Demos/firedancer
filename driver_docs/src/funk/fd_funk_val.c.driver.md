# Purpose
The provided C code is part of a library or module that manages records and their associated values within a workspace, likely for a database or data storage system. The file includes two primary functions: [`fd_funk_val_truncate`](#fd_funk_val_truncate) and [`fd_funk_val_verify`](#fd_funk_val_verify). The [`fd_funk_val_truncate`](#fd_funk_val_truncate) function is responsible for adjusting the size of a value associated with a record, either by truncating it to a smaller size or expanding it to a larger size, while ensuring memory allocation and alignment constraints are met. It handles edge cases such as zero-size truncation and allocation failures, updating the record's metadata accordingly. The function also provides error handling through an optional error parameter.

The [`fd_funk_val_verify`](#fd_funk_val_verify) function is designed to validate the integrity of all records within a given workspace. It iterates over each record, checking that the value sizes and addresses are consistent and adhere to expected constraints, such as ensuring that erased records do not have associated values. This function is crucial for maintaining data integrity and ensuring that the system's state is valid. The code is structured to be part of a larger system, as indicated by the use of specific data types and functions prefixed with `fd_funk_`, suggesting a modular design where this file provides specific functionality related to record value management and verification.

# Functions

### fd\_funk\_val\_truncate<!-- {{#callable:fd_funk_val_truncate}} -->
The `fd_funk_val_truncate` function adjusts the size of a value associated with a record, either truncating it to zero, increasing its size, or setting it to a specified size, while handling memory allocation and alignment.
- **Inputs**:
    - `rec`: A pointer to an `fd_funk_rec_t` structure representing the record whose value is to be truncated or resized.
    - `alloc`: A pointer to an `fd_alloc_t` structure used for memory allocation.
    - `wksp`: A pointer to an `fd_wksp_t` structure representing the workspace where the value is stored.
    - `align`: An unsigned long specifying the alignment requirement for the new value size.
    - `sz`: An unsigned long indicating the new size to which the value should be truncated or resized.
    - `opt_err`: An optional pointer to an integer where error codes can be stored, if provided.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check input arguments for validity, including null pointers, size limits, and alignment constraints.
    - If the requested size `sz` is zero, flush the existing value and return NULL.
    - If the requested size `sz` is greater than the current maximum size `val_max`, allocate new memory for the value, copy existing data, and update the record's value size and address.
    - If the requested size `sz` is less than or equal to the current maximum size `val_max`, simply update the record's value size.
    - Return the new value pointer or NULL if the size was zero.
- **Output**: Returns a pointer to the new value if successful, or NULL if the size is zero or an error occurs.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`fd_funk_val_flush`](fd_funk_val.h.driver.md#fd_funk_val_flush)

### fd\_funk\_val\_verify<!-- {{#callable:fd_funk_val_verify}} -->
The `fd_funk_val_verify` function verifies the integrity and validity of all records in a given `fd_funk_t` structure.
- **Inputs**:
    - `funk`: A pointer to an `fd_funk_t` structure whose records are to be verified.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Retrieve the workspace associated with the `funk` structure and its tag.
    - Iterate over all records in the `funk` structure using an iterator.
    - For each record, retrieve its size, maximum size, and global address.
    - Check that the record's size does not exceed its maximum size.
    - If the record is marked for erasure, ensure its maximum size and global address are zero.
    - If the record is not marked for erasure, verify that its maximum size does not exceed `FD_FUNK_REC_VAL_MAX`.
    - If the global address is zero, ensure the maximum size is also zero.
    - If the global address is non-zero, ensure the maximum size is within valid limits and the workspace tag matches the expected tag.
    - Log a warning and return an error code if any validation check fails.
- **Output**: Returns `FD_FUNK_SUCCESS` if all records are valid, otherwise returns `FD_FUNK_ERR_INVAL` if any validation check fails.
- **Functions called**:
