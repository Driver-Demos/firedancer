# Purpose
This C++ source code file is an executable program designed to perform a series of tests on a class or object named `fake_funk`, which is presumably defined in the included header file "test_funk_common.hpp". The program's primary purpose is to validate the functionality of `fake_funk` through a sequence of operations that simulate various transactions and modifications. The main function initializes a pseudo-random number generator with a fixed seed for reproducibility and then creates an instance of `fake_funk`, passing command-line arguments to its constructor. The program executes a loop 2000 times, within which it performs a series of operations such as `random_insert`, `random_new_txn`, `random_remove`, `random_publish`, and `random_publish_into_parent`, interspersed with calls to `verify` to check the integrity or correctness of the operations performed.

The code is structured to rigorously test the `fake_funk` object by simulating a variety of scenarios and ensuring that each operation maintains the expected state. The use of `verify` after each set of operations suggests that the program is designed to catch any inconsistencies or errors that may arise during the execution of these operations. The inclusion of logging every 100 iterations provides a mechanism for tracking progress and potentially diagnosing issues during the test run. The commented-out lines for `random_merge` and its subsequent `verify` call indicate that this functionality is either under development or not currently part of the test suite. Overall, this file serves as a comprehensive test harness for the `fake_funk` class, ensuring its robustness and reliability under a variety of conditions.

# Functions

---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function initializes a `fake_funk` object and performs a series of randomized operations and verifications in a loop to test its functionality.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: An integer representing the number of command-line arguments.
    - `argv`: An array of C-style strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize the random number generator with a seed value of 1234.
    - Create a `fake_funk` object `ff` using the command-line arguments.
    - Call `ff.verify()` to perform an initial verification of the `fake_funk` object.
    - Enter a loop that iterates 2000 times, performing a series of operations on the `fake_funk` object in each iteration.
    - Within each loop iteration, perform the following sequence of operations:
    - - Insert random elements 10 times and verify.
    - - Start new random transactions 10 times and verify.
    - - Insert random elements 50 times and verify.
    - - Remove random elements 20 times and verify.
    - - Publish random changes and verify.
    - - Start new random transactions 10 times and verify.
    - - Insert random elements 50 times and verify.
    - - Remove random elements 10 times and verify.
    - - Publish changes into parent and verify.
    - - Start new random transactions 10 times and verify.
    - - Insert random elements 50 times and verify.
    - - Remove random elements 10 times and verify.
    - - Cancel random changes and verify.
    - - Start new random transactions 10 times and verify.
    - - Insert random elements 50 times and verify.
    - - Remove random elements 10 times and verify.
    - - Publish changes into parent and verify.
    - Log a notice every 100 iterations with the current loop index.
    - Print 'test passed!' to the console after the loop completes.
- **Output**: Returns 0 to indicate successful execution.
