# Purpose
This C source code file is a unit test for a transactional data structure, likely part of a larger software library. The code is designed to test the functionality of a system that manages transactions and records, using a structure referred to as "funk." The test is executed only if the `FD_HAS_HOSTED` macro is defined, indicating that the environment supports the necessary hosted capabilities. The main components of the code include setting up a workspace, initializing random number generation, and creating a transactional data structure. The test iterates over a series of operations, including inserting, removing, preparing, canceling, and publishing transactions, while verifying the integrity and correctness of the operations against a reference implementation.

The code is structured to handle command-line arguments for configuration, such as workspace name, page size, and transaction limits, which are used to initialize the test environment. It uses assertions to ensure that certain conditions are met, such as alignment and flag values. The test involves creating and manipulating transactions and records, checking for consistency between the test implementation and a reference model. The code also includes error handling and logging to provide feedback on the test's progress and results. The file is intended to be compiled and executed as a standalone program to validate the transactional system's behavior under various conditions.
# Imports and Dependencies

- `fd_funk.h`
- `test_funk_common.h`


# Functions

---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function initializes the environment and logs a warning if the FD_HAS_HOSTED capabilities are not available, then halts the program.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The count of command-line arguments passed to the program.
    - `argv`: An array of strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function begins by calling `fd_boot` to initialize the environment with the command-line arguments.
    - It checks if the `FD_HAS_HOSTED` macro is defined; if not, it logs a warning message indicating that the unit test requires hosted capabilities.
    - The function then calls `fd_halt` to stop further execution.
    - Finally, it returns 0, indicating successful termination.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer value of 0, indicating successful execution.
