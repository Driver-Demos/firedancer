# Purpose
This C source code file is a unit test for the `fd_funk` module, which appears to be a component of a larger system that deals with memory management and transaction handling. The code is structured to run tests only if the `FD_HAS_HOSTED` macro is defined, indicating that it requires a hosted environment to execute. The main functionality of this file is to validate the behavior of the `fd_funk` module by testing various scenarios of memory allocation, initialization, joining, and deletion of `fd_funk` objects within a workspace. It uses a series of assertions and logging to ensure that the `fd_funk` module behaves as expected under different configurations and inputs.

The code begins by setting up the environment and parsing command-line arguments to configure the test parameters, such as workspace name, page size, and transaction limits. It then attempts to attach to or create a workspace, allocate shared memory, and perform a series of tests on the `fd_funk` functions. These tests include checking alignment, footprint calculations, and the creation and joining of `fd_funk` instances. The code also tests edge cases, such as zero transaction or record limits, and ensures that resources are properly cleaned up after the tests. The file serves as a comprehensive test suite for the `fd_funk` module, ensuring its reliability and correctness in managing transactions and memory within a specified workspace.
# Imports and Dependencies

- `fd_funk.h`


# Functions

---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function initializes the environment and logs a warning if the `FD_HAS_HOSTED` capability is not available, then halts execution.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The count of command-line arguments passed to the program.
    - `argv`: An array of strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Call `fd_boot` to initialize the environment with command-line arguments.
    - Log a warning message indicating that the unit test requires `FD_HAS_HOSTED` capabilities.
    - Call `fd_halt` to stop further execution of the program.
    - Return 0 to indicate successful execution.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer value of 0, indicating successful execution.
