# Purpose
This snippet is from a Makefile, a build automation tool used to compile and link programs. It conditionally adds object files `fd_resolv_tile` and `fd_discoh` to the build process if the macro `FD_HAS_SSE` is defined, indicating that the build should include these files when SSE (Streaming SIMD Extensions) support is available.
