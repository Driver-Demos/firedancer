- **[fd_resolv_tile.c](resolv/fd_resolv_tile.c.driver.md)**: The `fd_resolv_tile.c` file in the `firedancer` codebase implements a system for managing and resolving blockhashes and transactions, including handling transaction stashing, publishing, and metrics tracking, within a distributed computing environment.
- **[Local.mk](resolv/Local.mk.driver.md)**: The `Local.mk` file in the `firedancer` codebase conditionally adds the `fd_resolv_tile` object to the `fd_discoh` target if `FD_HAS_SSE` is defined.
