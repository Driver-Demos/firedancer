# Purpose
The file contains a Makefile snippet that uses a macro or function call `make-lib` to build or manage a library named `fd_discoh`. This is part of a build automation process, where `make-lib` is likely a predefined macro or function that encapsulates the necessary steps to compile or link the `fd_discoh` library within the software project.
