# Purpose
This Bash script is designed to perform a specific set of operations related to a configuration file, indicating narrow functionality. It checks for the existence of a configuration file named `tmp/test_ipc.conf` and exits with a message if the file is not found, suggesting that the script is part of a larger system where this configuration file is crucial. Upon finding the file, it sources the configuration, sets and exports an environment variable `FD_LOG_PATH` to an empty string, and then executes a command to delete a workspace using a tool or script located at `$BIN/fd_wksp_ctl`, passing `$WKSP` as an argument. Finally, it removes the configuration file and outputs "pass" to indicate successful completion. This script is likely a utility or maintenance script used in a development or testing environment to manage temporary configurations and resources.
