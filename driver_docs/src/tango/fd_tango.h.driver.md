# Purpose
This code is a C header file that serves as an inclusion guard and organizes the inclusion of several other header files related to a project or module named "tango." The file uses preprocessor directives to prevent multiple inclusions, ensuring that the contents are only included once during compilation. It includes a series of headers from different submodules such as "tempo," "cnc," "fseq," "fctl," "mcache," "dcache," and "tcache," each of which indirectly includes a common base header file, "fd_tango_base.h." This structure suggests that the file is part of a larger system where these components are interdependent, and it helps manage dependencies and modularize the codebase.
