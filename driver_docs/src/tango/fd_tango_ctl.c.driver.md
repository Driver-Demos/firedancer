# Purpose
The provided C source code file is an executable program designed to manage and manipulate various shared memory constructs, such as caches, sequences, and control nodes, within a hosted environment. The program is structured to handle command-line arguments, allowing users to perform operations like creating, deleting, querying, and updating these constructs. The main technical components include functions for managing memory caches (`mcache` and `dcache`), sequence numbers (`fseq`), control nodes (`cnc`), and transaction caches (`tcache`). Each command corresponds to a specific operation on these constructs, and the program provides detailed logging and error handling to guide users through successful execution or to report issues.

The code is organized around a command-line interface, where each command is parsed and executed in sequence. It includes commands such as `new-mcache`, `delete-mcache`, `query-mcache`, `new-dcache`, `delete-dcache`, `query-dcache`, and similar operations for `fseq`, `cnc`, and `tcache`. The program uses a workspace abstraction (`fd_wksp`) to manage shared memory allocations and mappings, ensuring that resources are properly allocated and freed. The code also includes a help command to assist users in understanding the available operations. This file is intended to be compiled into an executable that provides a broad range of functionalities for managing shared memory constructs in a system that supports hosted execution.

# Functions

---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function initializes the program, checks the number of command-line arguments, logs an error if the number of arguments is incorrect, and then halts the program.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: The count of command-line arguments passed to the program.
    - `argv`: An array of strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Call `fd_boot` to initialize the program with the given arguments.
    - Check if `argc` is less than 1, and log an error if true.
    - Check if `argc` is greater than 1, and log an error if true.
    - Log a notice indicating that 0 commands were processed.
    - Call `fd_halt` to halt the program.
    - Return 0 to indicate successful execution.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer value of 0, indicating successful execution.
