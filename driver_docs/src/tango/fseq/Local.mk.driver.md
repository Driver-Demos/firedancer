# Purpose
The file is a Makefile snippet used for building and testing components in a software project. It defines build rules by adding headers and object files for `fd_fseq` and `fd_tango`, sets up a unit test named `test_fseq` with dependencies on `fd_tango` and `fd_util`, and specifies the execution of this unit test.
