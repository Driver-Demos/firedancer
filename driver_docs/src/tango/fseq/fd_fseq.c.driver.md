# Purpose
This C source code file defines and manages a shared memory structure for a sequence number, specifically designed for use in a system called "firedancer." The primary component is the `fd_fseq_shmem_t` structure, which includes fields for a magic number (`FD_FSEQ_MAGIC`), an initial sequence number (`seq0`), and a current sequence number (`seq`). The magic number is used to verify the integrity and validity of the shared memory region. The file provides several functions to interact with this shared memory structure: [`fd_fseq_new`](#fd_fseq_new) initializes a new sequence in shared memory, [`fd_fseq_join`](#fd_fseq_join) allows access to the current sequence number, [`fd_fseq_leave`](#fd_fseq_leave) is used to leave the shared memory region, and [`fd_fseq_delete`](#fd_fseq_delete) cleans up the shared memory by resetting the magic number.

The code is designed to ensure proper alignment and integrity of the shared memory region, with checks for null pointers and alignment using `fd_ulong_is_aligned`. It uses memory fences (`FD_COMPILER_MFENCE`) to ensure memory operations are completed in the correct order, which is crucial in concurrent environments. The functions provided are intended to be used as part of a larger system, likely involving multiple processes or threads that need to coordinate using shared sequence numbers. This file does not define a public API but rather provides internal functionality for managing sequence numbers in shared memory, which can be integrated into larger applications requiring such synchronization mechanisms.

# Functions

### fd\_fseq\_align<!-- {{#callable:fd_fseq_align}} -->
The `fd_fseq_align` function returns the alignment requirement for the `fd_fseq_shmem` structure.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function is defined to return an unsigned long integer (`ulong`).
    - It directly returns the value of the macro `FD_FSEQ_ALIGN`.
- **Output**: The function outputs the alignment requirement as an unsigned long integer, which is defined by the macro `FD_FSEQ_ALIGN`.


---
### fd\_fseq\_footprint<!-- {{#callable:fd_fseq_footprint}} -->
The `fd_fseq_footprint` function returns the size of the memory footprint required for an fseq shared memory region.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function is defined to return an unsigned long integer.
    - It directly returns the value of the macro `FD_FSEQ_FOOTPRINT`.
- **Output**: The function outputs an unsigned long integer representing the memory footprint size for an fseq shared memory region.


---
### fd\_fseq\_new<!-- {{#callable:fd_fseq_new}} -->
The `fd_fseq_new` function initializes a shared memory region for a sequence number structure, setting its initial and current sequence numbers and marking it with a magic number for validation.
- **Inputs**:
    - `shmem`: A pointer to the shared memory region to be initialized.
    - `seq0`: The initial sequence number to set in the shared memory structure.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if the `shmem` pointer is NULL and log a warning if it is, returning NULL.
    - Check if the `shmem` pointer is properly aligned using `fd_fseq_align()` and log a warning if it is not, returning NULL.
    - Cast the `shmem` pointer to a `fd_fseq_shmem_t` pointer.
    - Clear the memory region using `memset` to zero out the structure up to `FD_FSEQ_FOOTPRINT`.
    - Set the `seq0` and `seq` fields of the structure to the provided `seq0` value.
    - Use memory fences (`FD_COMPILER_MFENCE`) to ensure memory operations are completed before and after setting the `magic` field.
    - Set the `magic` field of the structure to `FD_FSEQ_MAGIC` to mark it as initialized.
    - Return the original `shmem` pointer.
- **Output**: Returns the original `shmem` pointer if successful, or NULL if there is an error with the input pointer or alignment.

### fd\_fseq\_leave<!-- {{#callable:fd_fseq_leave}} -->
The `fd_fseq_leave` function returns a pointer to the start of the shared memory region containing the sequence number by offsetting the input pointer by two ulong positions backwards.
- **Inputs**:
    - `fseq`: A pointer to a ulong representing the current sequence number in a shared memory region.

    - If the input is valid, return a pointer to the memory location two ulong positions before the input pointer.

### fd\_fseq\_delete<!-- {{#callable:fd_fseq_delete}} -->
The `fd_fseq_delete` function invalidates a shared memory region by resetting its magic number to zero, ensuring it is no longer recognized as a valid sequence object.
