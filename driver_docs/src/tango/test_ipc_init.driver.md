# Purpose
This Bash script is designed to set up and configure a shared memory workspace for interprocess communication (IPC) in a specific environment, likely related to a project named "firedancer." It provides narrow functionality, focusing on initializing and configuring shared memory resources, such as creating and managing workspaces and caches, and setting up transmission (TX) and reception (RX) channels. The script checks for the presence of a build directory as an argument and uses various commands to manage shared memory configurations, including creating new control and cache structures. It also generates a configuration file (`test_ipc.conf`) that stores the details of the setup, which can be used for unit testing purposes. The script is intended to be executed from the base directory of the project and assumes certain permissions and system configurations are in place.
# Global Variables

---
### NUMA\_IDX
- **Type**: `integer`
- **Description**: `NUMA_IDX` is a global variable that is initialized to 0. It represents the index of the NUMA (Non-Uniform Memory Access) node that the script will use for allocating resources. This variable is crucial for ensuring that the script interacts with the correct NUMA node, which can affect performance and resource allocation.
- **Use**: `NUMA_IDX` is used to specify the NUMA node index when creating a new workspace with the `fd_wksp_ctl` command, ensuring that resources are allocated on the specified NUMA node.


---
### WKSP
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: The `WKSP` variable is a string that holds the name of the workspace used for interprocess communication in the script. It is set to the value 'test_ipc', which is likely a placeholder or default name for the workspace.
- **Use**: This variable is used to specify the name of the workspace when creating, deleting, or configuring shared memory objects for interprocess communication.


---
### WKSP\_CNT
- **Type**: `integer`
- **Description**: `WKSP_CNT` is a global variable that specifies the number of pages to be used for a workspace in a shared memory setup. It is set to 1, indicating that a single page of the specified type (`WKSP_PAGE`) will be used.
- **Use**: This variable is used to configure the number of pages allocated for the workspace when creating a new shared memory workspace with `fd_wksp_ctl`.


---
### WKSP\_PAGE
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: The `WKSP_PAGE` variable is a global string variable set to the value 'gigantic'. It is used to specify the size of the memory pages that will be allocated for the workspace in a shared memory environment.
- **Use**: This variable is used to define the size of the pages when creating a new workspace with the `fd_wksp_ctl` command.


---
### TX\_MAX
- **Type**: `integer`
- **Description**: `TX_MAX` is a global variable that defines the maximum number of transmission (TX) channels or instances that can be set up in the script. It is initialized with a value of 1, indicating that only one transmission channel is configured by default.
- **Use**: `TX_MAX` is used in a loop to set up the specified number of transmission channels, where each channel is initialized with control, memory cache, and data cache configurations.


---
### RX\_MAX
- **Type**: `integer`
- **Description**: `RX_MAX` is a global variable that specifies the maximum number of receive (RX) operations or channels that can be set up in the script. It is set to 16, indicating that up to 16 RX channels can be configured.
- **Use**: This variable is used in a loop to initialize and configure RX channels, specifically creating control and sequence objects for each channel.


---
### TX\_DEPTH
- **Type**: `integer`
- **Description**: The `TX_DEPTH` variable is a global integer variable set to 32768. It represents the depth or capacity of the transmission (TX) queue or buffer used in the script.
- **Use**: `TX_DEPTH` is used to configure the size of the transmission cache (`TX_MCACHE`) and data cache (`TX_DCACHE`) for each transmission index in the setup process.


---
### TX\_MTU
- **Type**: `integer`
- **Description**: The `TX_MTU` variable is an integer that represents the maximum transmission unit size for the transmission data cache. It is set to 1542, which is a typical size for Ethernet frames including some overhead.
- **Use**: This variable is used to configure the maximum size of data packets that can be handled by the transmission data cache (`TX_DCACHE`) in the script.


---
### APP\_SZ
- **Type**: `integer`
- **Description**: `APP_SZ` is a global variable defined in the script with a value of 4032. It represents the application size parameter used in various function calls related to shared memory and interprocess communication setup.
- **Use**: `APP_SZ` is used as a parameter in function calls to configure new CNC, MCACHE, and DCACHE instances, indicating the size of the application data structures.


---
### CONF
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: The `CONF` variable is a string that specifies the file path to a configuration file, `tmp/test_ipc.conf`. This file is used to store details about shared memory objects used for interprocess communications.
- **Use**: `CONF` is used to define the location where the script writes the configuration details of the shared memory setup.
