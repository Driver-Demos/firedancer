# Purpose
The file is a Makefile script used for building and testing components in a software project. It adds the header file `fd_tcache.h` and object files `fd_tcache` and `fd_tango` to the build process. Additionally, it defines and executes a unit test named `test_tcache`, which depends on `fd_tango` and `fd_util`.
