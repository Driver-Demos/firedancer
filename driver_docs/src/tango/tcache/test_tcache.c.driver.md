# Purpose
This C source code file is a unit test for a caching mechanism, specifically a tag cache (tcache) system. The code is designed to test various functionalities of the tcache, such as alignment, footprint calculation, map count defaults, and operations like query, insert, remove, and reset. The file includes a main function that initializes the environment, sets up a random number generator, and performs a series of tests to ensure the tcache behaves as expected under different conditions. The tests cover edge cases and typical usage scenarios, including the handling of duplicate tags and the performance of the cache under a simulated workload.

The code is structured to be executed in a hosted environment, as indicated by the `FD_HAS_HOSTED` preprocessor directive. It uses a series of assertions and logging statements to verify the correctness of the tcache operations and to provide feedback on the test results. The file is not intended to be a standalone application but rather a test suite that validates the functionality of the tcache implementation. It includes detailed logging for each step of the testing process, making it easier to identify any issues or failures. The code also includes a benchmarking section to measure the performance of the tcache under a high volume of operations, providing insights into its efficiency and scalability.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `../fd_tango.h`


# Functions

---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function initializes the environment and logs a warning if the `FD_HAS_HOSTED` capability is not available, then halts the program.
- **Inputs**:
    - `argc`: An integer representing the number of command-line arguments.
    - `argv`: An array of strings representing the command-line arguments.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Call `fd_boot` to initialize the environment with command-line arguments.
    - Log a warning message indicating that the unit test requires `FD_HAS_HOSTED` capabilities.
    - Call `fd_halt` to terminate the program.
    - Return 0 to indicate successful execution.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer value of 0, indicating successful execution.
