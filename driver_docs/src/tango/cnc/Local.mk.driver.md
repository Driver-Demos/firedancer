# Purpose
The file is a Makefile snippet used in a build system to manage dependencies and automate the compilation process. It defines rules to add header files (`fd_cnc.h`) and object files (`fd_cnc`, `fd_tango`) to the build, and specifies a unit test target (`test_cnc`) that depends on the `fd_tango` and `fd_util` components.
