# Purpose
The file is a Makefile snippet used for building and testing components in a software project. It specifies the inclusion of a header file `fd_dcache.h`, adds object files `fd_dcache` and `fd_tango` to the build, defines a unit test named `test_dcache` that depends on `fd_tango` and `fd_util`, and executes the `test_dcache` unit test.
