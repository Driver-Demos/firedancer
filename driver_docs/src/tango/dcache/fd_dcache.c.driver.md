# Purpose
This C source code file provides a set of functions for managing a data cache (dcache) in shared memory. The primary functionality includes calculating the required data size for the cache, aligning and computing the footprint of the cache, and creating, joining, leaving, and deleting a cache in shared memory. The code is designed to handle memory alignment and overflow issues robustly, ensuring that operations on the cache are safe and efficient. The functions also include mechanisms for logging warnings when invalid parameters or states are detected, which aids in debugging and maintaining the integrity of the cache operations.

The file defines several functions that operate on a data cache, such as [`fd_dcache_new`](#fd_dcache_new), which initializes a new cache in a given shared memory region, and [`fd_dcache_join`](#fd_dcache_join), which allows a process to access an existing cache. It also includes utility functions like [`fd_dcache_req_data_sz`](#fd_dcache_req_data_sz) to calculate the required data size based on parameters like MTU, depth, and burst, and [`fd_dcache_compact_is_safe`](#fd_dcache_compact_is_safe) to check if compacting the cache is safe given certain constraints. The code relies on a private header (`fd_dcache_private.h`) for internal structures and constants, indicating that it is part of a larger library or system where the cache is a critical component. The functions are designed to be used as part of a broader application, providing a public API for cache management while abstracting the underlying details.

# Functions

---
### fd\_dcache\_req\_data\_sz<!-- {{#callable:fd_dcache_req_data_sz}} -->
The `fd_dcache_req_data_sz` function calculates the required data size for a dcache based on the given MTU, depth, burst, and compactness parameters, ensuring no overflow occurs.
- **Inputs**:
    - `mtu`: The maximum transmission unit size, which determines the slot footprint.
    - `depth`: The depth of the dcache, representing the number of slots.
    - `burst`: The burst size, which is added to the depth to determine the total number of slots.
    - `compact`: A flag indicating whether the dcache should be compacted, affecting the total slot count.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if `mtu`, `depth`, or `burst` is zero and return 0 if any are, as these are invalid inputs.
    - Calculate the slot footprint using `FD_DCACHE_SLOT_FOOTPRINT(mtu)` and return 0 if it results in zero, indicating an overflow.
    - Calculate the total slot count as `depth + burst` and check for overflow by ensuring it is not less than `depth`.
    - If `compact` is true, increment the slot count by 1.
    - Check if the slot count is zero or if multiplying it by the slot footprint would overflow `ULONG_MAX`, returning 0 in either case.
    - Return the product of `slot_footprint` and `slot_cnt` as the required data size.
- **Output**: The function returns an unsigned long integer representing the required data size for the dcache, or 0 if any input validation fails or an overflow is detected.

    - Align the application size `app_sz` to the nearest multiple of `FD_DCACHE_ALIGN` and store it in `app_footprint`.
    - Check if `app_footprint` is less than `app_sz`, indicating an overflow, and return 0 if true.
    - Calculate the total footprint by adding `data_footprint` and `app_footprint`.
    - Check if the total footprint is less than `data_footprint`, indicating an overflow, and return 0 if true.
    - Add the size of `fd_dcache_private_hdr_t` to the total footprint to account for the header and guard.
    - Check if the total footprint is less than the size of `fd_dcache_private_hdr_t`, indicating an overflow, and return 0 if true.
