# Purpose
This C header file, `fd_dcache_private.h`, is designed to define the internal structure and operations related to a shared memory region used for a data cache, referred to as "dcache." The file provides a detailed layout of the shared memory region through the `fd_dcache_private_hdr` structure, which includes metadata such as the magic number (`FD_DCACHE_MAGIC`), data size, application size, and application offset. These fields are crucial for managing and accessing the shared memory efficiently, ensuring that the memory layout is consistent and aligned according to `FD_DCACHE_ALIGN`. The magic number serves as a unique identifier to verify the integrity and version of the memory layout.

Additionally, the file includes several inline functions that facilitate access to different parts of the dcache. These functions provide constant and mutable pointers to the cache and header, allowing for efficient manipulation and retrieval of data within the shared memory. The use of `FD_FN_CONST` suggests that these functions are intended to be optimized by the compiler for repeated calls with the same arguments. This header file is intended for internal use within a larger system, as indicated by its focus on private data structures and functions, and it does not define public APIs or external interfaces.

# Data Structures

---
### fd\_dcache\_private\_hdr
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `magic`: A magic number used to signal the layout of the shared memory region, expected to be FD_DCACHE_MAGIC.
    - `data_sz`: The size of the data region in bytes.
    - `app_sz`: The size of the application region in bytes.
    - `app_off`: The offset location of the application region relative to the first byte of the header.
    - `guard`: An aligned array used as a guard with a footprint defined by FD_DCACHE_GUARD_FOOTPRINT.
- **Description**: The `fd_dcache_private_hdr` structure defines the layout of a shared memory region used in a dcache system. It includes fields for a magic number to identify the layout, sizes for data and application regions, and an offset for the application region. The structure is aligned to `FD_DCACHE_ALIGN` and includes a guard array for additional memory protection. This layout ensures that the memory regions are properly aligned and reserved for specific purposes, facilitating efficient and safe access to shared memory.

### fd\_dcache\_private\_hdr\_t
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `magic`: A unique identifier for the dcache layout, expected to be FD_DCACHE_MAGIC.
    - `data_sz`: Specifies the size of the data region in bytes.
    - `app_sz`: Specifies the size of the application region in bytes.
    - `app_off`: Indicates the offset of the application region from the start of the header.
    - `guard`: An aligned padding array used for memory alignment and protection.
- **Description**: The `fd_dcache_private_hdr_t` structure defines the layout of a shared memory region used in a dcache system. It includes fields for a magic number to identify the layout, sizes for data and application regions, and an offset for the application region. The structure is aligned to `FD_DCACHE_ALIGN` and includes a guard array for alignment and protection purposes. This layout ensures that the memory regions are correctly aligned and accessible for both data and application-specific operations.


# Functions

---
### fd\_dcache\_private\_cache\_const<!-- {{#callable:fd_dcache_private_cache_const}} -->
The function `fd_dcache_private_cache_const` returns a pointer to the data region immediately following the header in a dcache structure.
- **Inputs**:
    - `dcache`: A constant pointer to an `fd_dcache_private_hdr_t` structure, representing the header of a dcache.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function takes a pointer to a dcache header structure as input.
    - It calculates the address immediately following the header by incrementing the pointer by one unit of the header's size.
    - The function returns this calculated address as a constant pointer to an unsigned character type.
- **Output**: A constant pointer to an unsigned character (`uchar const *`), pointing to the start of the data region following the dcache header.


---
### fd\_dcache\_private\_dcache<!-- {{#callable:fd_dcache_private_dcache}} -->
The function `fd_dcache_private_dcache` returns a pointer to the data region immediately following the header in a shared memory dcache structure.
- **Inputs**:
    - `dcache`: A pointer to a `fd_dcache_private_hdr_t` structure, representing the header of a shared memory dcache.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function takes a pointer to a `fd_dcache_private_hdr_t` structure as input.
    - It calculates the address immediately following the header by incrementing the pointer by one unit of `fd_dcache_private_hdr_t`.
    - The function returns this calculated address cast to a `uchar *`.
- **Output**: A pointer to the data region immediately following the `fd_dcache_private_hdr_t` header, cast to a `uchar *`.


---
### fd\_dcache\_private\_hdr\_const<!-- {{#callable:fd_dcache_private_hdr_const}} -->
The function `fd_dcache_private_hdr_const` calculates the address of the private header structure from a given pointer to a dcache memory region.
- **Inputs**:
    - `dcache`: A constant pointer to an unsigned character array representing the start of a dcache memory region.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function takes a pointer `dcache` and casts it to an unsigned long integer to perform pointer arithmetic.
    - It subtracts the size of the `fd_dcache_private_hdr_t` structure from the `dcache` pointer to calculate the address of the header.
    - The result is cast back to a constant pointer of type `fd_dcache_private_hdr_t` and returned.
- **Output**: A constant pointer to `fd_dcache_private_hdr_t`, representing the address of the private header structure associated with the given dcache memory region.
