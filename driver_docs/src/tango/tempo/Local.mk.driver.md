# Purpose
The file is a Makefile script used for building and testing components in a software project. It defines build rules by adding header files (`fd_tempo.h`) and object files (`fd_tempo`, `fd_tango`) to the build process. Additionally, it specifies the creation and execution of a unit test named `test_tempo`, which depends on the `fd_tango` and `fd_util` components.
