# Purpose
The file is a Makefile snippet used for building and testing components in a software project. It defines build rules by adding headers (`fd_mcache.h`) and object files (`fd_mcache`, `fd_tango`) to the build process. Additionally, it specifies the creation and execution of a unit test named `test_mcache`, which depends on `fd_tango` and `fd_util` components.
