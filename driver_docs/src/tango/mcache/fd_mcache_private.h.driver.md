# Purpose
This C header file defines the structure and functions related to the management of a shared memory cache, specifically for a system referred to as "mcache." It includes a unique magic number (`FD_MCACHE_MAGIC`) to identify the layout of the shared memory region, ensuring that the memory structure is correctly recognized and used. The `fd_mcache_private_hdr` structure outlines the layout of the shared memory, including fields for magic number verification, cache depth, application-specific size, initial sequence number, and application offset. The file also provides inline functions to access and manipulate the cache and its metadata, ensuring that the memory alignment and structure are maintained. This header is crucial for managing the memory layout and access patterns of the mcache system, facilitating efficient and safe shared memory operations.

# Data Structures

---
### fd\_mcache\_private\_hdr
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `magic`: A magic number used to signal the layout of the shared memory region.
    - `depth`: Represents the depth of the cache, defined as a power of two.
    - `app_sz`: Specifies the size of the application region in bytes.
    - `seq0`: The initial sequence number used during creation.
    - `app_off`: Indicates the offset of the application region relative to the header's first byte.
    - `seq`: An array aligned to FD_MCACHE_ALIGN, used for sequence numbers.
- **Description**: The `fd_mcache_private_hdr` structure defines the layout of a shared memory region used in a memory cache system. It includes fields for a magic number to identify the memory layout, the depth of the cache, the size and offset of an application-specific region, and an initial sequence number. The structure is aligned to `FD_MCACHE_ALIGN` and includes padding to ensure proper alignment, allowing for additional static data if needed. The `seq` array is used to store sequence numbers, and the structure is designed to facilitate efficient memory access and management in a concurrent environment.

### fd\_mcache\_private\_hdr\_t
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `magic`: A unique identifier for the memory layout, expected to be FD_MCACHE_MAGIC.
    - `depth`: Represents the depth of the cache, calculated as 2^lg_depth.
    - `app_sz`: Specifies the size of the application region in bytes.
    - `seq0`: The initial sequence number used during creation.
    - `app_off`: The offset of the application region from the start of the header.
    - `seq`: An array aligned to FD_MCACHE_ALIGN, used for sequence tracking.
- **Description**: The `fd_mcache_private_hdr_t` structure defines the layout of a shared memory region used in a memory cache system. It includes fields for a magic number to identify the memory layout, depth of the cache, size and offset of an application-specific region, and an initial sequence number. The structure is aligned to `FD_MCACHE_ALIGN` and includes padding for alignment purposes, allowing for additional static data and ensuring proper memory alignment for the sequence array and other components.


# Functions

---
### fd\_mcache\_private\_cache\_const<!-- {{#callable:fd_mcache_private_cache_const}} -->
The function `fd_mcache_private_cache_const` returns a constant pointer to the fragment metadata array located immediately after the private header in memory.
- **Inputs**:
    - `mcache`: A constant pointer to an `fd_mcache_private_hdr_t` structure, representing the private header of a memory cache.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function takes a pointer to an `fd_mcache_private_hdr_t` structure as input.
    - It calculates the address immediately following the `fd_mcache_private_hdr_t` structure in memory.
    - It casts this address to a constant pointer of type `fd_frag_meta_t` and returns it.
- **Output**: A constant pointer to `fd_frag_meta_t`, which is the fragment metadata array located immediately after the `fd_mcache_private_hdr_t` structure in memory.


---
### fd\_mcache\_private\_hdr\_const<!-- {{#callable:fd_mcache_private_hdr_const}} -->
The function `fd_mcache_private_hdr_const` returns a constant pointer to the private header of a memory cache given a pointer to a fragment metadata structure.
- **Inputs**:
    - `mcache`: A constant pointer to a `fd_frag_meta_t` structure, representing the fragment metadata of the memory cache.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function takes a pointer to a `fd_frag_meta_t` structure as input.
    - It calculates the address of the `fd_mcache_private_hdr_t` structure by subtracting the size of `fd_mcache_private_hdr_t` from the input pointer, effectively moving the pointer backwards in memory to the start of the private header.
    - The function returns the calculated address cast as a constant pointer to `fd_mcache_private_hdr_t`.
- **Output**: A constant pointer to a `fd_mcache_private_hdr_t` structure, representing the private header of the memory cache.
