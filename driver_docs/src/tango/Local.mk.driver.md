# Purpose
The provided content is from a Makefile, which is a build automation tool used to manage the build process of a software project. This Makefile uses custom functions, such as `make-lib`, `add-hdrs`, `make-bin`, and `make-unit-test`, to streamline the compilation and linking of various components within the project. The `make-lib` function is used to create a library named `fd_tango`, while `add-hdrs` adds header files `fd_tango_base.h` and `fd_tango.h` to the build process. The `make-bin` function compiles and links the binary `fd_tango_ctl` with dependencies on `fd_tango` and `fd_util`. Several unit tests, such as `test_tango_base`, `test_meta_tx`, and others, are defined using `make-unit-test`, each with specific dependencies. Finally, `add-test-scripts` lists test scripts that are likely used to validate the functionality of the software components.
