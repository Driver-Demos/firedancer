# Purpose
The provided Makefile is used to automate the simulation of a hardware design, specifically for testing the `ed25519_point_add` module using the Questa simulator. It sets up various environment variables and paths, such as `SIM` for the simulator, `MODULE` for the test module, and `RTL_DIR` for the directory containing the RTL (Register Transfer Level) source files. The file lists several Verilog source files, including those from the Xilinx Vivado library and custom RTL files, which are necessary for the simulation. Additionally, it includes a makefile from the cocotb framework, which is a coroutine-based co-simulation library for testing VHDL and Verilog, to facilitate the simulation process.
