# Purpose
This Makefile is used to automate the simulation process for a hardware design verification project, specifically targeting the verification of the `ed25519_sigverify_1` module. It sets up various environment variables and paths necessary for the simulation, such as the simulator to be used (`questa` by default), the module name (`test`), and the directory containing the RTL (Register Transfer Level) source files. The file lists several Verilog and SystemVerilog source files, including those from the Xilinx Vivado library and custom RTL files, which are required for the simulation. Additionally, it includes a makefile from the cocotb framework, which is a coroutine-based co-simulation library for verifying VHDL and Verilog designs, indicating that cocotb is used to facilitate the testbench and simulation environment.
