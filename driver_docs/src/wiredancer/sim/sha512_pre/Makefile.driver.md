# Purpose
The provided Makefile is used to automate the simulation process of a hardware design, specifically for a module named "test" using the Questa simulator. It sets up various environment variables and paths necessary for the simulation, such as the directory for RTL (Register Transfer Level) files and the top-level module, which is "sha512_pre". The file specifies the language for the top-level module as Verilog and lists several Verilog source files required for the simulation, including files from the Xilinx Vivado library and custom RTL files. Additionally, it includes a Makefile from the cocotb framework, which is a coroutine-based co-simulation library for writing testbenches in Python, to facilitate the simulation process.
