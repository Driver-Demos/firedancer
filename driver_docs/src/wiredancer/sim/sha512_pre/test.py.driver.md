# Purpose
This Python file is a test script designed to be executed within the Cocotb framework, which is a coroutine-based co-simulation library for verifying digital designs. The script is specifically tailored to test a digital design unit, referred to as `dut` (Device Under Test), by simulating clock signals and reset conditions, and by generating and applying a series of randomized input transactions to the DUT. The script utilizes several components from the `wd_cocotil` module, such as `toggle_reset` and `mon_sha_pre`, to manage reset toggling and to monitor the state of the DUT during the test. The test function, decorated with `@cocotb.test()`, orchestrates the simulation by initializing input signals, starting clock and reset processes, and then iteratively generating and applying input data to the DUT while monitoring its output.

The core functionality of this script revolves around generating random transactions with varying message lengths and attributes, which are then encoded into a binary format suitable for the DUT's input interface. The script uses the `BinaryValue` class to construct these input messages, ensuring they conform to the expected bit-width and format. The test also includes mechanisms to handle backpressure and random gaps in the input stream, simulating real-world conditions where data may not be continuously available. This script is a focused test case, not a general-purpose library, and is intended to be run as part of a larger suite of tests to validate the behavior and robustness of the digital design under test.

# Functions

### test<!-- {{#callable:firedancer/src/wiredancer/sim/sha512_pre/test.test}} -->
The `test` function is a cocotb test that simulates a digital circuit by generating random transactions, applying them to the device under test (DUT), and monitoring the output.
- **Decorators**: `@cocotb.test`
- **Inputs**:
    - `dut`: The device under test (DUT) which is a simulation object representing the digital circuit to be tested.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize the DUT's input signals `i_w` and `i_v` to 0.
    - Start the clock and reset processes using cocotb's `start` function and custom utility functions from `wd_cocotil`.
    - Wait for 1024 clock cycles to allow the DUT to stabilize post-reset.
    - Calculate the width `W` and total bit length `M` from the DUT's parameters and metadata.
    - Iterate over a loop to generate random message lengths and transactions, ensuring each length is used once before repeating.
    - For each transaction, extract the message and initialize control signals like `sop` (start of packet) and `size`.
    - While there are message bits remaining, handle backpressure by waiting for the DUT to be ready to accept new data.
    - Introduce random gaps by occasionally setting `i_v` to 0 and waiting for a clock edge.
    - Determine the end of packet (`eop`) and calculate the number of padding bytes needed (`e`).
    - Construct a binary message `b_m` with metadata and message content, adjusting for padding and packet boundaries.
    - Set the DUT's input signals `i_v`, `i_e`, and `i_m` to apply the transaction to the DUT.
    - Reset `sop` to 0 after the first packet segment and wait for a clock edge.
    - After all transactions are applied, set `i_v` to 0 and wait for the output queue `q_o_sha_pre` to empty.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it performs a simulation and applies transactions to the DUT, monitoring the output through side effects.
