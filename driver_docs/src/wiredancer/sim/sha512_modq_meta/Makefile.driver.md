# Purpose
The provided Makefile is used to automate the simulation process of a hardware design, specifically for a module named "test" using the Questa simulation tool. It sets up various environment variables and paths, such as `RTL_DIR` for the directory containing RTL (Register Transfer Level) source files and `TOPLEVEL` for the top-level module, which is `sha512_modq_meta`. The file lists multiple Verilog source files, including those from the Xilinx Vivado library and custom RTL files, which are necessary for the simulation. The `TOPLEVEL_LANG` is set to Verilog, indicating the language used for the top-level module. Additionally, the Makefile includes another Makefile from the cocotb configuration, which likely provides further simulation-related rules and settings.
