# Purpose
This Python file is a test script designed to verify the functionality of a digital design using the Cocotb framework, which is a coroutine-based co-simulation library for testing VHDL and Verilog designs. The script is structured to perform a series of operations on a device under test (DUT), which is likely a hardware module with specific input and output signals. The test is defined as an asynchronous function, `test(dut)`, which is decorated with `@cocotb.test()`, indicating that it is a test case to be executed by the Cocotb framework.

The script initializes several signals and parameters of the DUT, such as `i_v`, `o_r`, and `max_pending`, and sets up a clock signal using the `Clock` class from Cocotb. It utilizes utility functions from an imported module `wd_cocotil` to perform tasks like toggling reset signals, generating random toggles, and monitoring metadata. The test involves generating random transactions with varying metadata lengths and sending them to the DUT while handling backpressure conditions. The transactions are constructed using helper functions from `wd_cocotil`, and the script ensures that the DUT processes these transactions correctly by checking the output metadata against expected values. This test script is a crucial component in a verification environment, ensuring that the DUT behaves as expected under various conditions.

# Functions

---
### test<!-- {{#callable:firedancer/src/wiredancer/sim/sha512_modq_meta/test.test}} -->
The `test` function is a cocotb test that simulates a hardware design by generating and processing random transactions with backpressure handling.
- **Decorators**: `@cocotb.test`
- **Inputs**:
    - `dut`: The device under test (DUT) which is a hardware module being simulated.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize DUT signals `i_v`, `o_r`, and `max_pending`.
    - Create empty lists and dictionaries for input and output SHA modq metadata.
    - Start the clock and various asynchronous processes for reset toggling, random toggling, and monitoring using cocotb and wd_cocotil utilities.
    - Convert `META_W` from the DUT to an integer `M`.
    - Wait for 2048 clock cycles to allow for post-reset and key-store initialization.
    - Initialize transaction ID `tid` with a random 64-bit integer.
    - Loop for `max_l * 2` iterations to generate and process transactions.
    - Handle backpressure by waiting for `i_r` to be '1' when `i_v` is '1'.
    - Introduce random gaps by setting `i_v` to 0 based on a random condition.
    - Select a random message length `mlen` from a range and remove it from the list.
    - Generate a random transaction `tr` and append it to input and output metadata queues.
    - Build blocks from the transaction and iterate over them to set DUT inputs and wait for a clock edge.
    - Continue looping until the output metadata queue is empty, waiting for a clock edge each time.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it performs a simulation of the DUT by processing transactions and handling backpressure.
