# Purpose
This Makefile is designed for setting up and managing the simulation environment for a hardware design project, specifically using the Questa simulation tool. It defines various variables and paths necessary for the simulation, such as the simulation tool (`SIM`), the module name (`MODULE`), and directories for RTL (Register Transfer Level) and simulation files. The file lists a comprehensive set of Verilog source files (`VERILOG_SOURCES`) that are required for the simulation, including both standard library files from Xilinx Vivado and custom RTL files located in specified directories. The `TOPLEVEL` variable specifies the top-level module for the simulation, and additional simulation arguments (`SIM_ARGS`) and compile arguments (`COMPILE_ARGS`) are provided to configure the simulation environment further. The Makefile concludes by including another Makefile from the cocotb configuration, which likely provides additional rules and settings for running the simulation.
