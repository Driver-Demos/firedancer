# Purpose
This Verilog module, named `shcl_cpu`, is designed to handle hash data processing within a digital system, likely for cryptographic or data integrity purposes. The module is parameterized with several constants, such as `MUL_T`, `MUL_D`, `W_HASH`, `W_IN_MEM`, `W_T`, and `MAX_INFLIGHT`, which define the operational characteristics and constraints of the module, including hash width and memory addressing. It interfaces with external components through input and output ports, receiving hash data and a reference signal, and providing processed hash data, a reference, a memory address, and a validity signal. The module is structured to operate synchronously with a clock (`clk`) and can be reset (`rst`), indicating its integration into a larger synchronous digital system. The use of `default_nettype none` and `default_nettype wire` ensures strict type checking and clarity in signal declarations, promoting robust and error-free design practices.
# Modules

### shcl\_cpu
The `shcl_cpu` module is a hardware description of a CPU component that processes hash data. It includes parameters for configuration and ports for input and output of hash data and control signals.
- **Constants**:
    - `MUL_T`: A constant parameter set to 32'h007F_CCC2, likely used for multiplication or timing purposes.
    - `MUL_D`: A constant parameter set to 15, possibly used to define a delay or depth.
    - `W_HASH`: A constant parameter set to 256, defining the width of the hash data.
    - `W_IN_MEM`: A constant parameter set to 6, defining the width of the input memory address.
    - `W_T`: A constant parameter set to 16, defining the width of the hash reference.
    - `MAX_INFLIGHT`: A constant parameter calculated as (MUL_D+1)+6, likely defining the maximum number of inflight operations.
- **Ports**:
    - `clk`: Input clock signal for synchronization.
    - `rst`: Input reset signal to initialize the module.
    - `in_hash_data`: Input port for hash data with a width of W_HASH.
    - `in_hash_valid`: Input signal indicating the validity of the incoming hash data.
    - `in_hash_ref`: Input port for hash reference with a width of W_T.
    - `in_hash_ready`: Output signal indicating readiness to receive new hash data.
    - `out_hash_data`: Output port for processed hash data with a width of W_HASH.
    - `out_ref`: Output port for reference data with a width of W_T.
    - `out_d_addr`: Output port for data address with a width of W_IN_MEM.
    - `out_hash_valid`: Output signal indicating the validity of the outgoing hash data.
- **Logic And Control Flow**:
    - The module does not contain any logic or control flow as it is currently defined as an empty module.
