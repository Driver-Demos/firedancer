# Purpose
The provided Makefile is used to automate the simulation of a hardware design, specifically for a module named "test" using the Questa simulator. It sets up various environment variables and paths necessary for the simulation, such as the directory containing the RTL (Register Transfer Level) source files and the top-level module to be simulated, which is "ed25519_point_dbl". The file lists several Verilog source files, including those from the Xilinx Vivado library and custom RTL files, which are required for the simulation. Additionally, it includes a Makefile from the cocotb framework, which is a coroutine-based co-simulation library for verifying VHDL and Verilog designs, to facilitate the simulation process. This setup allows for efficient and repeatable simulation runs, ensuring that all necessary components are correctly configured and included.
