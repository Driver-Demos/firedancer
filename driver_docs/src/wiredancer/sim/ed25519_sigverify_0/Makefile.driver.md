# Purpose
The provided Makefile is used to automate the build and simulation process for a hardware design project, specifically focusing on the verification of the Ed25519 signature verification module. It sets up various environment variables and paths, such as the simulation tool (`SIM`), the module name (`MODULE`), and the directory containing the RTL (Register Transfer Level) source files (`RTL_DIR`). The file lists multiple Verilog and SystemVerilog source files under `VERILOG_SOURCES`, which are necessary for the simulation, including both standard library files from Xilinx Vivado and custom RTL files related to the Ed25519 signature verification. Additionally, it specifies compilation arguments, such as the path to an instruction ROM memory initialization file. The Makefile concludes by including another Makefile from the cocotb framework, which is a coroutine-based co-simulation library for verifying VHDL and Verilog designs.
