- **[ed25519_sigverify_dsdp_mul.sv](top_f1_models/ed25519_sigverify_dsdp_mul.sv.driver.md)**: The `ed25519_sigverify_dsdp_mul.sv` file defines a SystemVerilog module for performing multiplication and addition operations as part of the Ed25519 signature verification process in the Firedancer project.
- **[Makefile](top_f1_models/Makefile.driver.md)**: The `Makefile` in the `firedancer/src/wiredancer/sim/top_f1_models` directory is used to configure and build a simulation environment for Verilog modules using the Questa simulator, with various source files and compilation arguments specified.
- **[schl_cpu.sv](top_f1_models/schl_cpu.sv.driver.md)**: The `schl_cpu.sv` file defines a SystemVerilog module `shcl_cpu` for handling hash data input and output with specific parameters and signal interfaces.
- **[test.py](top_f1_models/test.py.driver.md)**: The `test.py` file in the `firedancer` codebase is a cocotb-based test script for simulating and verifying the behavior of a hardware design, including components like PCIe transactions, SHA processing, and ED25519 signature verification.
