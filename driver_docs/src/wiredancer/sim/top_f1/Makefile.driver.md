# Purpose
The provided Makefile is a build configuration file used to automate the compilation and simulation of a hardware design project, specifically using the Questa simulation tool. It defines various variables and paths, such as `SIM` for the simulator, `MODULE` for the test module, and `RTL_DIR` for the directory containing the RTL (Register Transfer Level) source files. The `VERILOG_SOURCES` variable lists all the Verilog and SystemVerilog source files required for the simulation, including both standard library files from Xilinx Vivado and custom RTL files located in the specified directory. The `COMPILE_ARGS` variable includes additional compilation arguments, such as defining the path to an instruction ROM memory initialization file. Finally, the Makefile includes another Makefile from the cocotb framework, which is a coroutine-based co-simulation library for writing testbenches in Python, to facilitate the simulation process.
