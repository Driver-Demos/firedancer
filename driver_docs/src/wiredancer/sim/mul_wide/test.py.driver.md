# Purpose
This Python code is a test script designed to be used with the Cocotb framework, which is a coroutine-based co-simulation library for verifying digital designs. The script is structured as a test function, [`test`](#test), which is decorated with `@cocotb.test()`, indicating that it is a test case to be executed by the Cocotb test runner. The primary purpose of this script is to verify the functionality of a digital design under test (DUT) by simulating clock cycles and checking the correctness of the DUT's output against expected results. The script sets up a clock signal for the DUT, initializes various parameters, and performs a series of operations over 1024 clock cycles to generate random input values, apply them to the DUT, and compare the DUT's output with expected values.

The script imports several components from the Cocotb library, such as `Clock`, `Timer`, `RisingEdge`, and `ReadOnly`, which are used to control the simulation timing and synchronization. It also imports a custom module, `wd_cocotil`, which appears to provide utility functions like `toggle_reset` and `random_int` for generating random integers and managing reset signals. The test function initializes the clock and reset signals, reads configuration parameters from the DUT, and iteratively applies random inputs to the DUT's input ports. It then checks the DUT's output against expected results, logging the results and asserting correctness. This script is a focused test case, providing narrow functionality aimed at verifying specific aspects of the DUT's behavior in a simulated environment.

# Functions

---
### test<!-- {{#callable:firedancer/src/wiredancer/sim/mul_wide/test.test}} -->
The `test` function is a cocotb-based asynchronous test that initializes a clock, performs a series of operations on a DUT (Device Under Test), and verifies the correctness of its output over multiple clock cycles.
- **Decorators**: `@cocotb.test`
- **Inputs**:
    - `dut`: The Device Under Test (DUT) which is an object representing the hardware module being tested.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize a clock with a 1 ns period and start it.
    - Start a reset toggle on the DUT's reset line with a 32-cycle duration, active high.
    - Determine the bit widths W, W0, and W1 from the DUT's attributes, defaulting to W if W0 or W1 are not present.
    - Extract the lower 8 bits of the DUT's T attribute.
    - Wait for 1024 clock cycles to pass.
    - For the next 1024 cycles, generate random integers for inputs i0 and i1, and a random integer m_i for a mask.
    - Set the DUT's input values in0, in1, and m_i based on the generated random values.
    - Wait for a rising edge of the clock.
    - Check if the first bit of the DUT's output m_o is '1'; if not, increment a counter D and continue if D is less than 100.
    - Pop the first tuple from the list of expected results and compare the expected and actual outputs, logging the results and asserting equality.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value but logs information and asserts the correctness of the DUT's output, raising an assertion error if the output does not match the expected results.
