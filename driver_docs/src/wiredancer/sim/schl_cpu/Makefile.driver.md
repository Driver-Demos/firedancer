# Purpose
The provided Makefile is used to automate the process of compiling and simulating a hardware design using a simulator, likely Questa, with the Cocotb framework. It specifies various configuration variables such as the simulator to use (`SIM`), the module name (`MODULE`), and the top-level module (`TOPLEVEL`). The file lists the source files required for the simulation, which include Verilog and SystemVerilog files located in both the Xilinx Vivado library and a specified RTL directory. Additionally, it sets compilation arguments, such as the path to a memory initialization file (`COMPILE_ARGS`). The Makefile concludes by including another Makefile from the Cocotb configuration, which likely contains additional rules and settings necessary for the simulation process.
