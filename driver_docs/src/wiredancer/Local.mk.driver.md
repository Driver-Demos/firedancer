# Purpose
This file is a Makefile snippet used for conditional compilation. It checks if the `FD_HAS_WIREDANCER` flag is defined, and if so, it triggers the creation of a library named `fd_wiredancer`, adds the header file `c/wd_f1.h`, and includes the object files from `c/wd_f1` for the `fd_wiredancer` library.
