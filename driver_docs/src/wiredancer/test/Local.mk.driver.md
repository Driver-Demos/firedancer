# Purpose
This Makefile snippet is used to conditionally compile and link components related to the "wiredancer" feature in a software project. It defines a library target `fd_wiredancer_test`, adds specific header files and object files, and sets up a unit test named `test_wiredancer_demo` with its dependencies, all of which are executed only if the `FD_HAS_WIREDANCER` flag is defined.
