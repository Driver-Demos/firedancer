# Purpose
This C header file, `wd_f1_mon.h`, is part of a larger software system, likely related to performance monitoring or diagnostics within a specific application context. The file defines a data structure, `wd_mon_state_t`, which is used to track various counters and states, such as received and sent message counts, replay and parser rates, and signal pass/fail counts. These metrics suggest that the file is used for monitoring the performance or health of a system, possibly in a networked or distributed environment. The inclusion of headers like `<pthread.h>`, `<sys/mman.h>`, and `<signal.h>` indicates that the system may involve multithreading, memory management, and signal handling, which are common in high-performance or real-time applications.

Additionally, the file provides a function, [`get_tsc_ticks_ns`](#get_tsc_ticks_ns), which is a simple calibration method for measuring time-stamp counter (TSC) ticks per nanosecond. This function uses the `clock_gettime` function to measure elapsed time and the `fd_tickcount` function to read the TSC, which is a CPU-specific feature used for high-resolution timing. The presence of this function suggests that precise timing measurements are critical for the application's performance analysis. The file also declares a function, [`mon_thread`](#mon_thread), which likely represents a monitoring thread, further supporting the idea that this file is part of a monitoring or diagnostic subsystem. Overall, this header file provides specialized functionality for performance monitoring within a larger software system.

# Global Variables

---
### mon\_thread
- **Type**: `function pointer`
- **Description**: `mon_thread` is a function pointer that takes a single argument of type `void*` and returns a `void*`. It is likely intended to be used as a thread function, which is a common pattern in C for multithreading using the POSIX threads library.
- **Use**: This variable is used as the entry point for a new thread, allowing the execution of code in parallel with other threads.


# Data Structures

### wd\_mon\_state\_t
- **Type**: `struct`
- **Members**:
    - `recv_cnt`: An array of two 64-bit unsigned integers representing the receive count.
    - `send_cnt`: A 64-bit unsigned integer representing the send count.
    - `cnt_replay`: A 64-bit unsigned integer representing the replay count.
    - `cnt_parser`: A 64-bit unsigned integer representing the parser count.
    - `cnt_x86`: A 64-bit unsigned integer representing the x86 count.
    - `cnt__wd`: A 64-bit unsigned integer representing the wd count.
    - `rate_replay`: A 64-bit unsigned integer representing the replay rate.
    - `rate_parser`: A 64-bit unsigned integer representing the parser rate.
    - `rate_x86`: A 64-bit unsigned integer representing the x86 rate.
    - `rate__wd`: A 64-bit unsigned integer representing the wd rate.
    - `sig_pass`: A 64-bit unsigned integer representing the signal pass count.
    - `sig_fail`: A 64-bit unsigned integer representing the signal fail count.
    - `cnt_checked`: A 64-bit unsigned integer representing the checked count.
    - `running`: A 32-bit unsigned integer indicating if the system is running.
    - `running_recv`: A 32-bit unsigned integer indicating if the receive process is running.
    - `slot`: A 32-bit unsigned integer representing the slot number.
    - `wd`: A wd_wksp_t type representing the workspace.
- **Description**: The `wd_mon_state_t` structure is used to monitor various counts and rates related to the operation of a system, likely in a network or processing context. It includes fields for tracking the number of received and sent packets, replay and parser operations, and specific counts and rates for x86 and wd operations. Additionally, it tracks signal pass and fail counts, the number of checked items, and running states, along with a workspace reference. This structure is essential for performance monitoring and diagnostics.


# Functions

---
### get\_tsc\_ticks\_ns<!-- {{#callable:get_tsc_ticks_ns}} -->
The function `get_tsc_ticks_ns` measures the number of CPU time-stamp counter (TSC) ticks per nanosecond by timing a busy-wait loop and calculating the difference in TSC values and elapsed time.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize `ts_start`, `ts_end`, `rdtsc_start`, `rdtsc_end`, and `i` variables.
    - Record the current time in `ts_start` using `clock_gettime` with `CLOCK_MONOTONIC`.
    - Capture the starting TSC value using `fd_tickcount` and store it in `rdtsc_start`.
    - Execute a busy-wait loop that iterates 100,000,000 times to simulate a compute-intensive task.
    - Capture the ending TSC value using `fd_tickcount` and store it in `rdtsc_end`.
    - Record the current time in `ts_end` using `clock_gettime` with `CLOCK_MONOTONIC`.
    - Calculate the time difference between `ts_end` and `ts_start` in seconds and nanoseconds, adjusting for negative nanoseconds by borrowing from seconds.
    - Convert the total time difference to nanoseconds and store it in `ns`.
    - Return the ratio of the difference in TSC values to the elapsed time in nanoseconds as a double.
- **Output**: The function returns a `double` representing the number of TSC ticks per nanosecond.


# Function Declarations (Public API)

---
### mon\_thread<!-- {{#callable_declaration:mon_thread}} -->
Executes a monitoring thread for hardware counters.
- **Description**: This function is designed to be run as a separate thread to monitor and display hardware counters periodically. It should be called with a pointer to a `wd_mon_state_t` structure, which contains the state and configuration for the monitoring process. The function will continue to execute as long as the `running` field in the provided state is true and will terminate if `running` becomes false. It periodically updates and displays counter values, making it suitable for real-time monitoring applications. Ensure that the `wd_mon_state_t` structure is properly initialized before calling this function.
- **Inputs**:
    - `arg`: A pointer to a `wd_mon_state_t` structure. This structure must be properly initialized and must not be null. The function uses this structure to access and update monitoring state and configuration. Invalid or null pointers will lead to undefined behavior.
- **Output**: Returns a null pointer upon completion, indicating the thread has terminated.
- **See also**: [`mon_thread`](wd_f1_mon.c.driver.md#mon_thread)  (Implementation)
