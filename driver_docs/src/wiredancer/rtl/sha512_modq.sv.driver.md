# Purpose
The provided Verilog code defines a module named `sha512_modq`, which is designed to perform cryptographic operations involving the SHA-512 hashing algorithm and modular arithmetic. This module is part of a larger cryptographic system, likely used for digital signatures or secure hashing, as indicated by the use of constants related to the Ed25519 elliptic curve, such as `ED25519_Q` and `ED25519_L0`. The module processes input data blocks, applies the SHA-512 hashing algorithm, and performs modular reduction operations to produce a final output. The code includes several submodules, such as `sha512_sch` and `sha512_block`, which handle the scheduling and block processing of the SHA-512 algorithm, respectively. Additionally, the module uses wide multiplication operations (`mul_wide` instances) to perform arithmetic operations on large bit-width data, which are essential for cryptographic computations.

The module's primary functionality is to take input data, hash it using SHA-512, and then perform modular arithmetic to ensure the result fits within a specified range, as dictated by the Ed25519 curve parameters. The code is structured to handle multiple data blocks, manage transaction IDs, and apply backpressure when necessary. The use of local parameters and logic variables indicates a focus on precise bit-width management, which is crucial in cryptographic applications to maintain data integrity and security. Overall, this module provides a specialized function within a cryptographic system, focusing on secure data processing and transformation using SHA-512 and modular arithmetic.
# Modules

### sha512\_modq
The `sha512_modq` module is designed to process SHA-512 hash computations and perform modular arithmetic operations with the Ed25519 curve's order. It integrates SHA-512 scheduling and block processing, along with wide multiplication and modular reduction to produce a final output.
- **Constants**:
    - `META_W`: A parameter defining the width of the transaction ID, set to 64 bits.
    - `ED25519_Q`: A local parameter representing the Ed25519 curve's order, used for modular arithmetic.
    - `ED25519_L0`: A local parameter representing a portion of the Ed25519 curve's order, used in calculations.
- **Ports**:
    - `i_v`: Input signal indicating the validity of the data.
    - `i_f`: Input signal indicating the first block of data.
    - `i_c`: Input signal representing the number of blocks.
    - `i_d`: Input data signal with a width of 1024 bits.
    - `i_t`: Input transaction ID signal with a width defined by META_W.
    - `i_p`: Output signal for backpressure, applied only for the first block.
    - `o_v`: Output signal indicating the validity of the output data.
    - `o_t`: Output transaction ID signal with a width defined by META_W.
    - `o_d`: Output data signal with a width of 256 bits.
    - `clk`: Clock input signal for synchronization.
    - `rst`: Reset input signal for initializing the module.
- **Logic And Control Flow**:
    - The module uses two local parameters, ED25519_Q and ED25519_L0, for modular arithmetic operations related to the Ed25519 curve.
    - The module instantiates a `sha512_sch` submodule for SHA-512 scheduling and a `sha512_block` submodule for block processing.
    - Three `mul_wide` instances perform wide multiplications, each configured with specific bit widths and control parameters.
    - An `always_ff` block updates several intermediate signals based on the results of modular arithmetic operations, using the Ed25519 curve's order for reductions.
    - An `always_comb` block reverses the order of the SHA-512 output data and prepares it for further processing.
    - Another `always_comb` block extracts and assigns portions of intermediate results to output signals, completing the modular reduction process.
