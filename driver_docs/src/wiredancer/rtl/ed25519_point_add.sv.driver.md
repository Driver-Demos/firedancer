# Purpose
The provided Verilog code defines a module named `ed25519_point_add`, which is designed to perform point addition on elliptic curves using the Ed25519 algorithm. This module is a specialized component that implements arithmetic operations over a finite field, specifically tailored for the Ed25519 curve, which is widely used in cryptographic applications for its high security and performance. The module takes in two points on the curve, represented by their coordinates (x, y, z, t), and outputs the result of their addition. The operations are performed using modular arithmetic, with the help of parameterized submodules for addition, subtraction, and multiplication, as well as pipelining for efficient data processing.

The code utilizes macros to define and instantiate these arithmetic operations, ensuring that the operations are modular and reusable. The use of parameters such as `T`, `D_M`, `D_A`, and `D_S` allows for flexibility in configuring the module's behavior, particularly in terms of timing and resource usage. The module is structured to maintain a clear hierarchy, as indicated by the `keep_hierarchy` attribute, which aids in synthesis and optimization processes. Overall, this code provides a focused implementation of a cryptographic primitive, serving as a building block for higher-level cryptographic protocols and systems that require secure and efficient elliptic curve operations.
