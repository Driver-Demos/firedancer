# Purpose
The provided Verilog code defines a module named `ed25519_sub_modp`, which is designed to perform modular subtraction operations specifically tailored for the Ed25519 elliptic curve cryptography. This module takes two wide input operands (`in0` and `in1`) and computes their difference modulo a prime number associated with the Ed25519 curve, denoted as `ED25519_P`. The module is parameterized to handle input widths of 255 bits and a modulus width of 128 bits, making it suitable for cryptographic operations that require high precision and large number arithmetic.

The core functionality of the module is implemented using a `shift_adder_3` instance, which is a specialized component for performing arithmetic operations with configurable parameters. The module also includes logic to determine if the result of the subtraction should be adjusted by adding the modulus, ensuring the result remains non-negative. This is achieved by comparing the inputs and conditionally adding the modulus if the first input is less than the second. The module is designed to be used in synchronous digital systems, as indicated by the clock (`clk`) and reset (`rst`) inputs, and it outputs the result of the subtraction (`out0`) along with a modified version of the modulus (`m_o`). This module is likely a part of a larger cryptographic library or system, providing a specific arithmetic operation needed for implementing Ed25519-based cryptographic protocols.
# Modules

### ed25519\_sub\_modp
The `ed25519_sub_modp` module performs modular subtraction of two inputs, `in0` and `in1`, under the modulus defined by `ED25519_P`. It utilizes a `shift_adder_3` instance to compute the result and outputs the subtraction result and a modified input.
- **Constants**:
    - `W`: Defines the bit-width of the main input and output data, set to 255.
    - `M`: Defines the bit-width of the auxiliary input and output data, set to 128.
- **Ports**:
    - `clk`: Clock signal input for synchronization.
    - `rst`: Reset signal input to initialize the module.
    - `in0`: First input operand for the subtraction operation.
    - `in1`: Second input operand for the subtraction operation.
    - `m_i`: Auxiliary input data of width M.
    - `m_o`: Auxiliary output data of width M.
    - `out0`: Output of the subtraction operation, representing the result of in0 - in1 mod ED25519_P.
- **Logic And Control Flow**:
    - The module defines internal logic signals `m_o_p`, `c_2_AB`, and `c_2_AB_ge_p` for intermediate calculations.
    - The `c_2_AB_ge_p` signal is assigned the result of comparing `c_2_AB` with `ED25519_P`.
    - The `c_0_a_lt_b` signal is assigned the result of comparing `in0` with `in1`.
    - A `shift_adder_3` instance is used to perform the subtraction operation, taking into account the comparison result `c_0_a_lt_b` to conditionally add `ED25519_P` to the result.
