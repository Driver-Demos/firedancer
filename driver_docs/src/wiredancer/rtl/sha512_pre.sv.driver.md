# Purpose
The provided Verilog code defines a module named `sha512_pre`, which is part of a broader system likely related to cryptographic operations, specifically the SHA-512 hashing algorithm. This module appears to be a preparatory stage for processing data blocks before they are fed into the SHA-512 hashing function. It handles the input and output of data blocks, manages the state transitions necessary for processing these blocks, and prepares the data by padding it according to the SHA-512 specification. The module uses parameters to define the block size (`W_BLK`), data width (`W_D`), and buffer size (`BUFF_SZ`), which are critical for ensuring the correct handling of data sizes in cryptographic operations.

The module is structured around a state machine that transitions through various states to manage the data flow and processing. It includes functions like `n_blks` to calculate the number of blocks needed for a given size and `l_to_b` to convert data from one format to another. The state machine handles different stages of data preparation, including setting flags, managing data readiness, and performing necessary padding operations. The use of packed structures and logic assignments ensures efficient data handling and state management. This module is a specialized component within a larger cryptographic system, focusing on preparing data for SHA-512 hashing by managing input/output signals, state transitions, and data formatting.
# Modules

### sha512\_pre
The `sha512_pre` module is designed to prepare data for SHA-512 hashing by managing input and output signals and processing data blocks. It uses state machines and functions to handle data transformation and control flow for the SHA-512 pre-processing stage.
- **Constants**:
    - `W_BLK`: Defines the block width for the SHA-512 process, set to 1024 bits.
    - `W_D`: Defines the data width, set to 512 bits.
    - `BUFF_SZ`: Defines the buffer size, set to 512 bits.
- **Ports**:
    - `i_r`: Output logic signal indicating readiness.
    - `i_w`: Input wire signal for write enable.
    - `i_v`: Input wire signal for valid data.
    - `i_e`: Input wire signal for end of data.
    - `i_m`: Input wire for metadata, sized according to `sv_meta2_t`.
    - `o_v`: Output logic signal indicating valid output.
    - `o_e`: Output logic signal indicating end of output.
    - `o_m`: Output logic for metadata, sized according to `sv_meta3_t`.
    - `clk`: Input wire for clock signal.
    - `rst`: Input wire for reset signal.
- **Logic And Control Flow**:
    - The module uses a state machine with states 0 to 5 to manage data processing and transitions based on input signals.
    - In state 0, the module initializes output signals and calculates the number of blocks needed using the `n_blks` function.
    - State 1 handles data writing and transitions based on the input valid and end signals.
    - State 2 processes additional data and manages transitions based on the extra data flag and input signals.
    - State 3 and 4 handle padding and finalization of the data block, setting specific bytes to 0x80 or 0x00 as needed.
    - State 5 finalizes the data block by setting the size and transitioning back to state 0.
    - The `always_ff` block updates the `self` state on the rising edge of the clock and resets it when the reset signal is active.


# Functions and Tasks

---
### l\_to\_b
The function `l_to_b` converts a 1024-bit logic vector into a byte-reversed 2D array of 8-bit logic vectors.
- **Inputs**:
    - `l`: A 1024-bit logic vector that represents the input data to be converted.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Declare an integer `i` for loop iteration and a 2D logic array `b` to store the byte-reversed output.
    - Iterate over each 8-bit segment of the input logic vector `l`, from the least significant byte to the most significant byte.
    - Assign each 8-bit segment of `l` to the corresponding position in the 2D array `b`, reversing the order of bytes.
    - Return the byte-reversed 2D array `b` as the function's output.
- **Output**: The function returns a 2D array of 8-bit logic vectors, representing the byte-reversed version of the input logic vector.

### n\_blks
The `n_blks` function calculates the number of 128-bit blocks required to store a given size in bits, including padding.
- **Inputs**:
    - `sz`: A 11-bit logic vector representing the size in bits that needs to be processed into 128-bit blocks.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function first calculates `sz2` by adding 1 and 16 (which is 128/8) to the input size `sz`.
    - It then extracts the 4 most significant bits from the 8th bit of `sz2` and adds it to the logical OR of the least significant 7 bits of `sz2`.
    - The result is returned as the number of 128-bit blocks required.
- **Output**: The function returns a 4-bit logic vector representing the number of 128-bit blocks needed to store the input size, including padding.
