# Purpose
The provided Verilog code defines a module named `simple_dual_port_ram`, which implements a simple dual-port RAM using Xilinx's Parameterized Macros (XPM). This module is designed to facilitate memory operations with two ports: one for reading and another for writing, allowing simultaneous read and write operations. The module is parameterized to allow customization of address width, data width, clocking mode, memory primitive type, and write mode, among other features. The key technical component of this module is the instantiation of the `xpm_memory_sdpram`, which is a pre-defined Xilinx macro for creating dual-port RAMs. This macro provides a flexible and efficient way to implement memory structures in FPGA designs, supporting various configurations and optimizations.

The module is primarily intended for use in FPGA designs where a dual-port RAM is required, offering a broad functionality that can be tailored to specific needs through its parameters. It includes detailed parameter and port usage tables, which guide the user in configuring the memory according to their requirements. The module supports independent or common clocking for the read and write ports, and it can be configured to use different types of memory primitives, such as block or distributed memory. This makes it a versatile component that can be integrated into larger systems, providing essential memory functionality with the ability to handle different data widths and address spaces.
# Modules

### simple\_dual\_port\_ram
The `simple_dual_port_ram` module is a parameterized Verilog module that implements a simple dual-port RAM using Xilinx's XPM_MEMORY library. It supports independent clocking for read and write operations and allows for configurable data and address widths.
- **Constants**:
    - `ADDRESS_WIDTH`: Defines the width of the address bus for both read and write operations, defaulting to 10 bits.
    - `DATA_WIDTH`: Specifies the width of the data bus for both read and write operations, defaulting to 32 bits.
    - `REGISTER_OUTPUT`: Determines if the output is registered, with a default value of 0 indicating no registration.
    - `CLOCKING_MODE`: Sets the clocking mode to either 'common_clock' or 'independent_clock', defaulting to 'independent_clock'.
    - `MEMORY_PRIMITIVE`: Specifies the type of memory primitive to use, defaulting to 'block'.
    - `WRITE_MODE`: Defines the write mode behavior, defaulting to 'read_first'.
- **Ports**:
    - `rd_clock`: Input clock signal for read operations.
    - `rd_address`: Input address for read operations, width defined by ADDRESS_WIDTH.
    - `q`: Output data from read operations, width defined by DATA_WIDTH.
    - `rd_en`: Input enable signal for read operations.
    - `wr_clock`: Input clock signal for write operations.
    - `wr_address`: Input address for write operations, width defined by ADDRESS_WIDTH.
    - `wr_byteenable`: Input byte enable signal for write operations, width is DATA_WIDTH/8.
    - `data`: Input data for write operations, width defined by DATA_WIDTH.
    - `wr_en`: Input enable signal for write operations.
- **Logic And Control Flow**:
    - The module instantiates an XPM_MEMORY simple dual-port RAM with parameters set for address width, data width, and other configurations.
    - The read and write operations are controlled by independent clock signals, allowing for asynchronous operation between the two ports.
    - The module uses a parameterized approach to configure the memory size, clocking mode, and other features, providing flexibility in its application.
