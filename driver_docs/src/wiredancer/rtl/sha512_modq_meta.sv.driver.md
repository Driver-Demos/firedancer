# Purpose
The provided Verilog code defines a module named `sha512_modq_meta`, which serves as an interface for processing data using a SHA-512 hashing algorithm with additional metadata handling. This module is designed to integrate with a broader system that requires cryptographic hashing, specifically using SHA-512, while managing metadata through a structured approach. The module is parameterized to allow flexibility in the key size (`KEY_D`) and its logarithmic representation (`KEY_D_L`), which are crucial for handling variable-length keys and metadata efficiently.

The module consists of several key components, including input and output ports for data, control signals, and metadata, as well as internal logic for managing the flow of data and control signals. It instantiates two submodules: `key_store` and `sha512_modq`. The `key_store` submodule is responsible for managing key-related operations, while the `sha512_modq` submodule performs the actual SHA-512 hashing. The module uses logic to coordinate the interaction between these submodules, ensuring that data is processed correctly and efficiently. The use of parameters and structured metadata types (`sv_meta3_t` and `sv_meta4_t`) indicates a design focused on modularity and reusability, making it suitable for integration into larger cryptographic systems.
# Modules

---
### sha512\_modq\_meta
The `sha512_modq_meta` module is designed to handle metadata processing for SHA-512 operations, integrating key storage and SHA-512 modular operations. It manages input and output signals, including backpressure and valid signals, and coordinates with submodules for key storage and SHA-512 processing.
- **Constants**:
    - `KEY_D`: Defines the key size, set to 512 bits.
    - `KEY_D_L`: Represents the logarithm base 2 of the key size, calculated using $clog2(KEY_D).
- **Ports**:
    - `i_r`: Output logic signal indicating backpressure, applied only for the first block.
    - `i_w`: Input wire signal indicating a wait condition.
    - `i_v`: Input wire signal indicating the validity of the input data.
    - `i_e`: Input wire signal indicating the last block.
    - `i_m`: Input wire carrying metadata of type sv_meta3_t.
    - `o_v`: Output logic signal indicating the validity of the output data.
    - `o_e`: Output logic signal, always set to 1, indicating the end of processing.
    - `o_m`: Output logic carrying metadata of type sv_meta4_t.
    - `clk`: Input wire for the clock signal.
    - `rst`: Input wire for the reset signal.
- **Logic And Control Flow**:
    - The module assigns the input backpressure signal `i_r` based on a combination of internal signals and the wait condition `i_w`.
    - The `i_mm` signal is assigned directly from the input metadata `i_m`.
    - The `key_i_v` and `sha_i_v` signals are derived from the input metadata and other control signals to manage the flow of data through the module.
    - The `o_e` signal is constantly assigned the value 1, indicating the end of processing.
    - The `o_m` signal is assigned the value of `o_mm`, which is updated in the always block.
    - An always_ff block is triggered on the positive edge of the clock, updating the `o_v` signal and part of the `o_mm` metadata, and resetting `o_v` if the reset signal is active.
    - The module instantiates a `key_store` submodule to handle key storage operations, passing relevant signals and parameters.
    - The module instantiates a `sha512_modq` submodule to perform SHA-512 modular operations, passing relevant signals and parameters.
