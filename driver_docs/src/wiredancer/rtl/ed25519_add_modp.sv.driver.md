# Purpose
The provided Verilog code defines a module named `ed25519_add_modp`, which is designed to perform modular addition operations specifically tailored for the Ed25519 elliptic curve cryptography. This module takes two wide input operands (`in0` and `in1`) and a modulus input (`m_i`), and it outputs the result of the modular addition (`out0`) along with an updated modulus output (`m_o`). The module is parameterized by the width of the operands (`W`) and the modulus (`M`), allowing for flexibility in the bit-width of the operations. The core functionality is implemented using two instances of a `piped_adder` module, which handles the addition and conditional subtraction based on the Ed25519 prime (`ED25519_P`), ensuring the result stays within the desired modular range.

This code provides a specific functionality focused on cryptographic operations, particularly for the Ed25519 curve, which is widely used in secure communications. The use of `piped_adder` instances suggests a pipelined approach to handle the arithmetic operations efficiently, which is crucial for high-performance cryptographic computations. The module is not a collection of disparate components but rather a cohesive implementation aimed at a specific cryptographic task, making it a specialized component likely used within a larger cryptographic library or system.
# Modules

---
### ed25519\_add\_modp
The `ed25519_add_modp` module performs modular addition of two inputs, `in0` and `in1`, with respect to a modulus `ED25519_P`. It uses two instances of a `piped_adder` to compute the sum and conditionally subtract the modulus if necessary.
- **Constants**:
    - `W`: Defines the bit-width of the primary input operands, set to 255.
    - `M`: Defines the bit-width of the modulus input and output, set to 128.
- **Ports**:
    - `clk`: Clock signal input for synchronization.
    - `rst`: Reset signal input to initialize the module.
    - `in0`: First input operand for the addition, with a width of W bits.
    - `in1`: Second input operand for the addition, with a width of W bits.
    - `m_i`: Input modulus value with a width of M bits.
    - `m_o`: Output modulus value after processing, with a width of M bits.
    - `out0`: Output result of the modular addition, with a width of W bits.
- **Logic And Control Flow**:
    - The module uses two `piped_adder` instances to perform the addition and conditional subtraction.
    - The first `piped_adder` instance, `c0_addmodp_inst`, adds the inputs `in0` and `in1` and outputs the result to `c_2_AB`.
    - The second `piped_adder` instance, `c2_addmodp_inst`, conditionally subtracts the modulus `ED25519_P` if the result `c_2_AB` is greater than or equal to `ED25519_P`.
    - The `assign` statement computes `c_2_AB_ge_p` to determine if the subtraction is necessary.
