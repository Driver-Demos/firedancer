# Purpose
The provided Verilog code defines a module named `schl_cpu_instr_rom`, which serves as an instruction read-only memory (ROM) for a CPU. This module is designed to store and provide access to a set of instructions, which are loaded from an external memory initialization file (MIF) specified by the macro `PATH_TO_INSTR_ROM_MIF`. The ROM is parameterized by its width (`ROM_WIDTH`) and depth (`ROM_DEPTH`), allowing for flexibility in the size of the instruction set it can handle. The module supports dual-port access, enabling two separate addresses (`a_addr` and `b_addr`) to be read simultaneously, each controlled by an enable signal (`a_en` and `b_en`). The outputs `a_data` and `b_data` provide the instruction data corresponding to the addresses when the respective enable signals are active.

This module is a specialized component within a larger CPU design, focusing on the storage and retrieval of instructions. It is not a broad functionality module but rather a specific implementation of an instruction memory, crucial for the operation of a CPU. The use of dual-port access allows for efficient instruction fetching, which can be beneficial in pipelined CPU architectures where multiple instructions may need to be accessed concurrently. The module's design emphasizes the importance of parameterization and initial memory loading, which are key technical components for adapting the instruction ROM to different CPU designs and instruction sets.

### schl\_cpu\_instr\_rom
The `schl_cpu_instr_rom` module is a dual-port instruction ROM designed to store and provide instruction data for a CPU. It supports simultaneous read operations from two different addresses, controlled by enable signals.
- **Constants**:
    - `ROM_WIDTH`: Defines the bit-width of each instruction stored in the ROM.
    - `ROM_DEPTH`: Specifies the total number of instructions that can be stored in the ROM, defaulting to 4096.
    - `W_ROM_DEPTH`: Calculates the bit-width required to address the ROM, using the logarithm base 2 of ROM_DEPTH.
- **Ports**:
    - `clk`: Clock signal for synchronizing read operations.
    - `rst`: Reset signal, though not used in the current implementation.
    - `a_addr`: Address input for the first read port.
    - `a_en`: Enable signal for the first read port.
    - `a_data`: Output data from the first read port.
    - `b_addr`: Address input for the second read port.
    - `b_en`: Enable signal for the second read port.
    - `b_data`: Output data from the second read port.
- **Logic And Control Flow**:
    - The ROM is initialized using the `$readmemb` function to load data from a memory initialization file specified by `PATH_TO_INSTR_ROM_MIF`.
    - An `always_ff` block is used to handle read operations on the positive edge of the clock signal.
    - If `a_en` is high, the data at address `a_addr` is assigned to `a_data`.
    - If `b_en` is high, the data at address `b_addr` is assigned to `b_data`.
