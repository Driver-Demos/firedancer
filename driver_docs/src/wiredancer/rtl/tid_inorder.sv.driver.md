# Purpose
The provided Verilog code defines a module named `tid_inorder`, which is designed to manage and ensure the in-order processing of transactions based on their timestamps. This module is particularly focused on maintaining the order of transactions as they are received and processed, ensuring that they are published in the same sequence as they were invoked. The module uses a 64-bit timestamp to track the order of transactions, which is incremented with each clock cycle. This timestamp is crucial for determining the sequence of transactions and ensuring that they are processed in the correct order. The module employs dual-port RAMs to store transaction data and their associated timestamps, allowing for efficient read and write operations.

The `tid_inorder` module is a specialized component that handles transaction ordering, making it a narrow-functionality module within a larger system. It uses two instances of a `simple_dual_port_ram` to store transaction data and the last-seen timestamps, respectively. The module's logic ensures that transactions are only output if their timestamp is newer than the last-seen timestamp, thus maintaining the correct order. The module also includes logic to handle input and output flow control, using signals such as `i_v`, `o_v`, and `o_r` to manage the readiness and validity of data. This module is likely a part of a larger system where transaction order is critical, such as in communication protocols or data processing pipelines.
# Modules

### tid\_inorder
The `tid_inorder` module ensures that transactions are processed in the order they were received, using a timestamp mechanism to track and manage transaction order. It utilizes dual-port RAMs to store transaction data and timestamps, allowing for efficient reordering and retrieval of transactions.
- **Constants**:
    - `W`: Defines the width of the data input and output ports, set to 32 bits.
    - `D`: Specifies the depth of the RAM, set to 16, which determines the number of transactions that can be stored.
    - `D_L`: Calculated as the logarithm base 2 of D, representing the address width for the RAM.
    - `W_L`: Calculated as the logarithm base 2 of W, representing the width of the data.
- **Ports**:
    - `i_v`: Input valid signal indicating if the input data is valid.
    - `i_a`: Input address for writing data into the RAM.
    - `i_d`: Input data to be written into the RAM.
    - `i_f`: Output flag indicating if the input count has reached its maximum.
    - `i_c`: Output count of valid inputs processed.
    - `o_r`: Output ready signal indicating if the output data can be read.
    - `o_v`: Output valid signal indicating if the output data is valid.
    - `o_d`: Output data read from the RAM.
    - `clk`: Clock input signal for synchronizing operations.
    - `rst`: Reset input signal to initialize or reset the module state.
- **Logic And Control Flow**:
    - The module uses a 64-bit timestamp to track the order of transactions, incrementing it on each clock cycle.
    - Two dual-port RAM instances are used: one for storing transaction data and timestamps, and another for storing the last-seen timestamps for each transaction ID.
    - The `oo_r` signal is assigned based on the output ready signal `o_r` and the negation of the output valid signal `o_v`.
    - The `oo_a_n` signal determines the next address for reading from the RAM, incrementing if both `oo_v` and `oo_r` are true.
    - The `i_f` flag is set when the input count `i_c` reaches its maximum value, indicating the RAM is full.
    - The `oo_v` signal is set when the current timestamp `oo_t` is greater than the last-seen timestamp `last_ts`, indicating a new transaction.
    - An `always_ff` block updates the timestamp, address, and output signals on each positive clock edge, and handles reset conditions.
    - A case statement within the `always_ff` block adjusts the input count `i_c` based on the input and output valid signals.
    - A display statement logs transaction details whenever input or output valid signals are active.
