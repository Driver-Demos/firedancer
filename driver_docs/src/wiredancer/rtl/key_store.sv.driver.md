# Purpose
The provided Verilog code defines a module named `key_store`, which implements a storage mechanism with a key-based access system. This module is designed to handle data storage and retrieval operations using a FIFO (First-In-First-Out) approach, where data is stored and accessed using keys. The module is parameterized by the data width (`D`), the width of the data to be stored (`W`), and the calculated log base 2 of the data width (`D_L`). The key components of this module include a state machine for managing the FIFO index, a `showahead_fifo` for handling the key management, and a `simple_dual_port_ram` for storing the actual data. The module provides interfaces for pushing data into the storage (`i_v`, `i_d`) and popping data out (`o_r`, `o_k`), with the ability to check for available space (`i_r`) and retrieve stored data (`o_d`).

The `key_store` module is a specialized component that provides a narrow functionality focused on key-based data storage and retrieval. It integrates a FIFO mechanism to manage the keys and a dual-port RAM to store the data, ensuring efficient access and storage operations. The state machine within the module initializes and manages the FIFO index, transitioning through states to fill the FIFO and handle reset conditions. This module is likely intended for use in larger systems where key-based data management is required, serving as a building block for more complex data handling architectures.
# Modules

### key\_store
The `key_store` module is designed to manage a key-value storage system using a FIFO and dual-port RAM. It handles data storage and retrieval operations based on input control signals and provides a mechanism to track available storage space.
- **Constants**:
    - `D`: Defines the depth of the storage, set to 512 by default.
    - `D_L`: Represents the bit-width required to address the storage depth, calculated as the logarithm base 2 of D.
    - `W`: Specifies the width of the data to be stored, defaulting to 1 bit.
- **Ports**:
    - `i_r`: Output signal indicating if there is empty space available for new data.
    - `i_v`: Input signal to push new data into the storage.
    - `i_k`: Output key provided to the pusher for storing data.
    - `i_d`: Input data to be stored in the storage system.
    - `o_r`: Input signal to pop data from the storage.
    - `o_k`: Input key to specify which data to pop from the storage.
    - `o_d`: Output data that has been popped from the storage, available in the next cycle.
    - `clk`: Clock signal for synchronizing operations.
    - `rst`: Reset signal to initialize or reset the module state.
- **Logic And Control Flow**:
    - The module uses a state machine controlled by `idx_st` to manage the initialization and operation of the FIFO.
    - In state 0, the module waits for the FIFO reset, incrementing `idx_wd[0]` until it reaches 1024, then transitions to state 1.
    - In state 1, the module fills the FIFO by incrementing `idx_wd[0]` until it reaches D-1, then transitions to state 2.
    - State 2 is a placeholder for additional operations or idle state.
    - The `always_ff` block is sensitive to the positive edge of the clock and handles state transitions and reset conditions.
    - The `showahead_fifo` instance manages the FIFO operations, using `idx_we` and `idx_wd` for write operations and `idx_rr` for read operations.
    - The `simple_dual_port_ram` instance manages data storage, using `idx_rd` for write addresses and `o_k` for read addresses.
