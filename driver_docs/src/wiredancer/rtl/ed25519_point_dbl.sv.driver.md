# Purpose
The provided Verilog code defines a module named `ed25519_point_dbl`, which is designed to perform point doubling operations on elliptic curve points using the Ed25519 curve. This module is a specialized component that implements arithmetic operations in a finite field, specifically tailored for cryptographic applications involving the Ed25519 elliptic curve. The module takes in four 255-bit inputs representing the coordinates of a point on the curve (`in0_x`, `in0_y`, `in0_z`, `in0_t`) and produces four 255-bit outputs (`out0_x`, `out0_y`, `out0_z`, `out0_t`) that represent the doubled point. The operations are performed using modular addition, subtraction, and multiplication, which are defined through macros (`ADD`, `SUB`, `MUL`) and are parameterized to handle 255-bit wide data.

The code also includes pipelining through the `PIP` macro, which helps manage data flow and timing by introducing pipeline stages. This is crucial for maintaining high throughput and efficient resource utilization in hardware implementations. The module is part of a broader cryptographic library, as indicated by the import statement `import wd_sigverify::*;`, suggesting that it is a component within a larger system for signature verification. The use of parameters and macros allows for flexibility and reusability, making this module a key building block in cryptographic hardware designs that require efficient and secure elliptic curve operations.

### ed25519\_point\_dbl
The `ed25519_point_dbl` module performs point doubling on elliptic curve points in the Ed25519 curve. It takes in coordinates of a point and outputs the doubled point coordinates using modular arithmetic operations.
- **Constants**:
    - `T`: A 32-bit constant used in the module, set to 32'h007F_CCC2.
    - `D_M`: A constant parameter with a value of 15, used in pipelining and arithmetic operations.
    - `D_A`: A constant parameter with a value of 4, used in pipelining and arithmetic operations.
    - `D_S`: A constant parameter with a value of 2, used in pipelining and arithmetic operations.
    - `CT`: A 4-bit constant derived from the lower 4 bits of T.
    - `ST`: A constant derived by right-shifting T by 4 bits.
    - `R_I`: A constant parameter set to 0, possibly used for initialization.
    - `M`: A constant parameter set to 128, used for defining the width of certain inputs and outputs.
- **Ports**:
    - `clk`: Clock input for synchronizing operations.
    - `rst`: Reset input to initialize or reset the module.
    - `in0_x`: 255-bit input representing the x-coordinate of the point.
    - `in0_y`: 255-bit input representing the y-coordinate of the point.
    - `in0_z`: 255-bit input representing the z-coordinate of the point.
    - `in0_t`: 255-bit input representing the t-coordinate of the point.
    - `out0_x`: 255-bit output representing the x-coordinate of the doubled point.
    - `out0_y`: 255-bit output representing the y-coordinate of the doubled point.
    - `out0_z`: 255-bit output representing the z-coordinate of the doubled point.
    - `out0_t`: 255-bit output representing the t-coordinate of the doubled point.
    - `m_i`: 128-bit input for additional modular arithmetic operations.
    - `m_o`: 128-bit output for additional modular arithmetic operations.
- **Logic And Control Flow**:
    - The module uses several logic variables to store intermediate results of arithmetic operations, such as R1_s, R3_a, R5_sm, etc.
    - Arithmetic operations are performed using macros `ADD`, `SUB`, `MUL`, and `PIP`, which are defined to perform modular addition, subtraction, multiplication, and pipelining respectively.
    - The module calculates intermediate values using the input coordinates and constants, and then computes the output coordinates by performing a series of modular arithmetic operations.
    - The `PIP` macro is used to introduce pipelining in the computation, which helps in managing the timing and synchronization of operations.
    - The final outputs are computed by multiplying the intermediate results, which represent the coordinates of the doubled point on the elliptic curve.
