# Purpose
The provided Verilog code defines a module named `dma_result`, which is designed to handle Direct Memory Access (DMA) operations in a system with multiple PCIe interfaces. The module is parameterized by `N_PCIE`, which specifies the number of PCIe interfaces it supports, allowing for scalable integration into systems with varying numbers of PCIe connections. The primary functionality of this module is to manage the flow of data between external PCIe interfaces and internal system components, ensuring data integrity and synchronization through various control signals and data paths.

Key components of the `dma_result` module include the use of pipelined wires and FIFOs to manage data flow and buffering, as well as a round-robin merge mechanism (`rrb_merge`) to consolidate data from multiple PCIe interfaces into a single output stream. The module also incorporates address manipulation and control signal generation to facilitate DMA operations, with specific attention to address masking and base address adjustments for privacy and security. The use of `always_ff` blocks ensures that operations are synchronized with the system clock, maintaining data consistency across clock cycles. Overall, this module provides a focused and efficient solution for managing DMA transactions in a multi-PCIe environment, making it a critical component in systems requiring high-speed data transfer and processing.

    - `rst`: Input wire for reset signal.
- **Logic And Control Flow**:
    - The module uses a `generate` block to create instances of logic for each PCIe interface, iterating over `N_PCIE`.
    - Within the `generate` block, it assigns control and data signals for each PCIe interface, using logic to determine valid and ready states.
    - The `piped_wire` instance is used to pipeline external signals, ensuring synchronization with the clock and reset signals.
    - A `showahead_fifo` is instantiated to buffer and manage data flow, with a depth of 512 entries.
    - The `tid_inorder` instance manages transaction IDs in order, ensuring data integrity and order across PCIe interfaces.
    - The `rrb_merge` instance merges read and valid signals from multiple PCIe interfaces, outputting combined results.
    - An `always_ff` block is used to update result parity signals based on the clock, ensuring data consistency.
    - A `$display` statement is used for debugging, printing the state of DMA signals when any valid signal is active.
