# Purpose
The provided Verilog code defines a module named `dual_clock_showahead_fifo`, which implements a dual-clock, show-ahead FIFO (First-In-First-Out) buffer. This module is designed to handle asynchronous data transfer between two clock domains, making it suitable for applications where data needs to be passed between components operating at different clock frequencies. The module is parameterized to allow customization of data width, FIFO depth, and other operational characteristics, providing flexibility for various use cases. The code supports two library implementations: "xpm" (Xilinx Parameterized Macros) and "exablaze", each offering different features and configurations for the FIFO.

The core functionality of the module is to manage data flow between write and read operations, ensuring data integrity and synchronization across clock domains. It includes signals for write and read requests, data input and output, and status indicators such as full, empty, and data count. The "xpm" implementation leverages Xilinx's asynchronous FIFO macros, providing advanced features like error correction and programmable thresholds, while the "exablaze" implementation offers a simpler FIFO structure. The module's design is highly configurable, allowing users to tailor it to specific requirements by adjusting parameters like data width and FIFO depth, making it a versatile component in digital design projects.
# Modules

---
### dual\_clock\_showahead\_fifo
The `dual_clock_showahead_fifo` module is a dual-clock FIFO (First-In-First-Out) buffer that supports asynchronous read and write operations with separate clocks for each. It is designed to handle data transfer between two clock domains, providing features like full and empty flags, and is configurable to use either Xilinx's XPM or Exablaze's FIFO implementations.
- **Constants**:
    - `LIB`: Specifies the library to use for FIFO implementation, defaulting to 'xpm'.
    - `WIDTH`: Defines the width of the data bus, defaulting to 32 bits.
    - `DEPTH`: Specifies the depth of the FIFO, defaulting to 32.
    - `D_L`: Calculated as the logarithm base 2 of DEPTH, used for sizing count signals.
- **Ports**:
    - `wr_clk`: Input clock signal for write operations.
    - `wr_req`: Input signal to request a write operation.
    - `wr_data`: Input data bus for writing data into the FIFO.
    - `wr_full`: Output signal indicating the FIFO is full.
    - `wr_full_b`: Output signal indicating the FIFO is not full (complement of wr_full).
    - `wr_count`: Output bus indicating the number of words written into the FIFO.
    - `rd_clk`: Input clock signal for read operations.
    - `rd_req`: Input signal to request a read operation.
    - `rd_data`: Output data bus for reading data from the FIFO.
    - `rd_empty`: Output signal indicating the FIFO is empty.
    - `rd_not_empty`: Output signal indicating the FIFO is not empty (complement of rd_empty).
    - `rd_count`: Output bus indicating the number of words read from the FIFO.
    - `aclr`: Input signal for asynchronous clear/reset.
- **Logic And Control Flow**:
    - The module uses a `generate` block to select between different FIFO implementations based on the `LIB` parameter.
    - If `LIB` is set to 'xpm', the module instantiates an `xpm_fifo_async` with various parameters for configuration, such as `FIFO_WRITE_DEPTH`, `READ_MODE`, and `USE_ADV_FEATURES`.
    - The `xpm_fifo_async` instance handles the FIFO operations, including managing full and empty flags, data counts, and error detection.
    - If `LIB` is set to 'exablaze', the module instantiates an `async_fifo` with a simpler interface, focusing on basic FIFO operations without advanced features.
    - The module includes logic to complement the full and empty signals to provide both positive and negative logic outputs.
