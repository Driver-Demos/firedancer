- **[design](f1/design.driver.md)**: The `design` folder in the `firedancer` codebase contains a SystemVerilog module file, `cl_dram_dma.sv`, which is responsible for managing Direct Memory Access (DMA) operations with DRAM.
- **[scripts](f1/scripts.driver.md)**: The `scripts` folder in the `firedancer` codebase contains a script for synthesizing a custom logic design for an AWS FPGA, specifically the `synth_cl_dram_dma.tcl` file.
