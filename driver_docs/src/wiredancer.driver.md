## Folders
- **[c](wiredancer/c.driver.md)**: The `c` folder in the `firedancer` codebase contains source and header files for managing PCIe interactions and performing ED25519 signature verification in the AWS F1 FPGA environment.
- **[platform](wiredancer/platform.driver.md)**: The `platform` folder in the `firedancer` codebase contains the `f1` folder, which includes resources for FPGA development such as constraints, design, and scripts.
- **[py](wiredancer/py.driver.md)**: The `py` folder in the `firedancer` codebase contains Python files focused on implementing and testing cryptographic operations, particularly using the Ed25519 curve, including signature verification, point decomposition, and multiplication, as well as providing a reference implementation and simulation tools.
- **[rtl](wiredancer/rtl.driver.md)**: The `rtl` folder in the `firedancer` codebase contains a collection of SystemVerilog files implementing various hardware modules for asynchronous reset synchronization, DMA handling, dual-clock FIFOs, Ed25519 cryptographic operations, PCIe transaction management, SHA-512 hashing, and a simplified RISC CPU architecture, all designed to support the Firedancer consensus node by Jump Crypto.
- **[sim](wiredancer/sim.driver.md)**: The `sim` folder in the `firedancer` codebase contains various subfolders and a README file dedicated to simulating and verifying hardware designs using Verilog, Questa, and cocotb, focusing on operations like ED25519 point addition and doubling, signature verification, wide multiplication, CPU simulation, and SHA-512 processing.
- **[test](wiredancer/test.driver.md)**: The `test` folder in the `firedancer` codebase contains source files and headers for implementing and testing packet replay, monitoring, and diagnostics functionalities, specifically for AWS-F1 FPGA systems, along with build configurations for the `fd_wiredancer_test` library.

## Files
- **[Local.mk](wiredancer/Local.mk.driver.md)**: The `Local.mk` file in the `firedancer` codebase is a makefile that conditionally builds the `fd_wiredancer` library and adds headers and objects if `FD_HAS_WIREDANCER` is defined.
- **[README.md](wiredancer/README.md.driver.md)**: The `README.md` file in the `firedancer/src/wiredancer` directory provides detailed instructions and information on building, using, and understanding the WireDancer functionalities, including its asynchronous API, SigVerify process, and pipeline design for AWS-F1 series platforms.
