# Purpose
The provided code is a Bash script named `deps-bundle.sh`, which is designed to create a redistributable bundle of build dependencies. This script offers a narrow functionality focused on packaging static libraries and include files into a compressed archive using Zstandard compression and GNU tar. It is not an executable or a library file but rather a utility script intended to be run in a specific build environment. The script assumes that a dependency prefix has already been created using another script (`deps.sh`) and packages the contents into a file named `deps-bundle.tar.zst`. This file can then be stored in blob storage solutions like Git LFS, facilitating easier distribution and deployment of the necessary build dependencies without requiring additional tools like Perl or Bison.
