# Purpose
This Bash script is designed for internal use, likely within a development environment, and provides narrow functionality focused on managing software modules. It checks if the script is executed with the "install" argument, and if so, it installs a specific package (`jump_module_gcc-12.2.0`) using the `yum` package manager, which suggests it is intended for systems using Red Hat-based distributions. After handling the installation, the script purges any currently loaded modules and then loads the `gcc-12.2.0` module, ensuring that the specified version of GCC is active. Finally, it lists all currently loaded modules, which helps verify the environment setup. This script is likely used to prepare development hosts with the necessary compiler version and manage module environments efficiently.
