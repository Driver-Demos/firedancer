# Purpose
This shell script is a utility tool designed to search through a Git repository for specific patterns in the code, specifically looking for occurrences of 'for (' and 'if (' statements. It provides narrow functionality, focusing solely on identifying these patterns, which might be used for code style enforcement or refactoring purposes. The script is not an executable in the traditional sense but rather a utility script that can be run in a Unix-like environment to assist developers in maintaining code consistency. By exiting with a status of 1 if any matches are found, it can be integrated into automated workflows to flag code that does not meet certain criteria.
