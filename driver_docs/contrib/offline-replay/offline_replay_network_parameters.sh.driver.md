# Purpose
This Bash script, `set_network_env.sh`, is a configuration file designed to set environment variables based on the specified network parameter, which can be "mainnet", "testnet", or "devnet". It provides narrow functionality, specifically tailored for configuring the environment for different Solana blockchain networks. The script checks if a network parameter is provided and sets various environment variables such as `BUCKET_ENDPOINT`, `GENESIS_FILE`, and others, which are crucial for the operation of Solana nodes in different network environments. Additionally, it sets some general environment variables like `ALLOC_HUGE_PAGES`, `ALLOC_GIGANTIC_PAGES`, and paths for identity and vote account keys, which are likely used for node configuration and operation. This script is intended to be sourced, not executed directly, as indicated by the usage of `return` statements, which are only valid in sourced scripts.
# Global Variables

---
### network
- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: The `network` variable is a global string variable that holds the name of the network environment (e.g., 'mainnet', 'testnet', or 'devnet') specified by the user as a command-line argument. It is used to determine which set of environment variables to export, configuring the script to interact with the appropriate Solana network environment.
- **Use**: This variable is used to select and set the appropriate environment configurations for the specified Solana network.
