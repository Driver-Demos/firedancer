# Purpose
This Bash script is designed for internal use, likely within a development environment, to manage software packages and modules. It provides narrow functionality, specifically focusing on the installation and configuration of the Clang 15.0 module. The script checks if the first argument passed is "install" and, if so, uses the `yum` package manager to install the `jump_module_clang-15.0` package, which is necessary for development hosts. After installation, it purges any currently loaded modules and loads the Clang 15.0 module, ensuring that the environment is set up correctly for development tasks. This script is not an executable or a library but rather a utility script for configuring development environments.
