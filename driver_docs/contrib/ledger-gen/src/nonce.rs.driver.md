# Purpose
This Rust source code file defines a function `create_nonce_account` that interacts with the Solana blockchain to create and manage nonce accounts. The primary purpose of this code is to facilitate the creation of a nonce account, which is a special type of account used in Solana to ensure transaction uniqueness and prevent replay attacks. The function utilizes the Solana SDK and client libraries to perform blockchain operations such as fetching the latest blockhash, creating and signing transactions, and sending them to the network. It also handles the retrieval and verification of nonce account states to ensure they are properly initialized before use.

The code is structured to perform a series of operations: it first creates a nonce account with a specified balance, then opens a new account using the nonce account for transaction signing. It repeatedly checks and updates the nonce blockhash to ensure the transactions are valid and can be confirmed by the network. The function makes use of utility functions from the `instructions` and `utils` modules, indicating a modular design where specific tasks are delegated to these components. This file is likely part of a larger application or library that interacts with the Solana blockchain, providing a specific functionality related to nonce account management.

# Functions

### create\_nonce\_account
The `create_nonce_account` function creates a nonce account on the Solana blockchain, initializes it, and uses it to open new accounts with nonce-based transactions.
- **Inputs**:
    - `client`: An instance of `RpcClient` used to interact with the Solana blockchain.
    - `payer`: A `Keypair` representing the account that will pay for the transactions and account creation fees.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Retrieve the latest blockhash from the Solana blockchain using the `client`.
    - Generate nonce account creation instructions using the `instructions::create_nonce_account_instructions` function.
    - Create and sign a transaction with the nonce account creation instructions and send it to the blockchain using the `client`.
    - Print the public key of the created nonce account and the current slot number.
    - Retrieve the nonce blockhash from the initialized nonce account using `get_account_with_commitment` and `nonblocking::state_from_account`.
    - Create a new `Keypair` for a new account and determine the minimum balance required for rent exemption.
    - Create an account creation instruction for the new account and construct a nonce-based message using `Message::new_with_nonce`.
    - Sign the transaction with the payer and new account keypairs, then send and confirm the transaction using the `client`.
    - Print the public key of the newly opened account.
    - Wait for at least two slots to pass using `utils::wait_atleast_n_slots`.
    - Repeat the process of retrieving the nonce blockhash, creating a new account, and sending a nonce-based transaction to open the account.
    - Print the transaction details and wait for additional slots to pass before sending and confirming the transaction again.
    - Retrieve and print the nonce blockhash from the nonce account after the final transaction.
- **Output**: The function does not return any value, but it prints the public keys of the created nonce and new accounts, the nonce blockhash, and transaction details to the console.
