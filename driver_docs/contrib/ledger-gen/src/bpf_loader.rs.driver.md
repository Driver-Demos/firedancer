# Purpose
This Rust source code file provides a set of functions designed to manage the lifecycle of programs on the Solana blockchain. The primary operations include deploying, invoking, upgrading, closing, and redeploying programs. The file leverages the Solana SDK and client libraries to interact with the blockchain, utilizing key components such as `RpcClient` for network communication and `Keypair` for cryptographic signing. The functions are organized to demonstrate various scenarios of program management, such as deploying and invoking a program within the same slot or across different slots, upgrading a program, and handling the closure and potential redeployment of programs.

The code is structured around a series of public functions, each encapsulating a specific sequence of operations related to program management on Solana. These functions make extensive use of helper modules, `instructions` and `utils`, to perform tasks like setting up buffer accounts, creating and signing transactions, and waiting for specific blockchain states. The functions are designed to be executed in a script-like manner, printing transaction signatures and slot information to the console for verification and debugging purposes. This file serves as a practical example or utility for developers working with Solana programs, providing a clear API for managing program lifecycles in a blockchain environment.
