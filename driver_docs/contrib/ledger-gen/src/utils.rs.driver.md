# Purpose
This Rust source code file provides a set of utility functions and configurations for interacting with the Solana blockchain, specifically focusing on handling and verifying ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) files, creating and signing transactions, and managing slot-based timing. The code is structured to facilitate operations that are common in blockchain environments, such as reading and verifying program binaries, constructing and signing transactions, and synchronizing operations with the blockchain's slot progression. The use of the Solana SDK and related libraries indicates that this code is intended to be part of a larger application or library that interacts with the Solana network.

The file defines several key functions and a static configuration. The `read_and_verify_elf` function reads an ELF file from a specified location, verifies its integrity using Solana's runtime environment, and returns the program data if successful. The `create_message_and_sign` function constructs a Solana transaction from a set of instructions, signs it with the provided keypairs, and prepares it for submission to the network. The `wait_atleast_n_slots` function is a utility for pausing execution until a specified number of slots have passed, ensuring synchronization with the blockchain's state. Additionally, the file uses the `lazy_static` crate to define a static configuration, `SKIP_PREFLIGHT_CONFIG`, which is used to configure transaction submission to skip preflight checks, optimizing for scenarios where such checks are unnecessary. Overall, this code provides essential building blocks for applications that need to interact programmatically with the Solana blockchain.

# Functions

---
### create\_message\_and\_sign
The `create_message_and_sign` function constructs a Solana transaction from given instructions, a payer, and a list of signers, and signs it using the provided blockhash.
- **Inputs**:
    - `instructions`: A vector of `Instruction` objects that define the operations to be included in the transaction.
    - `payer`: A `Keypair` representing the account that will pay for the transaction fees.
    - `signers`: A vector of references to `Keypair` objects that will be used to sign the transaction.
    - `blockhash`: A `Hash` representing the recent blockhash to be used for the transaction.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Create a `Message` object using the provided instructions, payer's public key, and blockhash.
    - Initialize an unsigned `Transaction` object with the created message.
    - Attempt to sign the transaction using the provided signers and blockhash.
    - Return the signed transaction.
- **Output**: A `Transaction` object that has been signed with the provided signers and blockhash.

### read\_and\_verify\_elf
The `read_and_verify_elf` function reads an ELF file from a specified location, verifies its integrity, and returns the program data if successful.
- **Inputs**:
    - `program_location`: A string slice representing the file path to the ELF program that needs to be read and verified.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Attempt to open the file at the given `program_location` and handle any errors by returning a formatted error message.
    - Read the entire contents of the file into a `Vec<u8>` and handle any read errors similarly.
    - Create a program runtime environment using `create_program_runtime_environment_v1` with default feature set and compute budget settings.
    - Attempt to create an `Executable` from the ELF data using the runtime environment, returning an error if this fails.
    - Verify the `Executable` using `RequisiteVerifier`, returning an error if verification fails.
    - Return the program data as a `Vec<u8>` if all steps are successful.
- **Output**: Returns a `Result` containing a `Vec<u8>` of the program data if successful, or a boxed error if any step fails.


---
### wait\_atleast\_n\_slots
The `wait_atleast_n_slots` function pauses execution until the Solana blockchain has advanced by at least a specified number of slots.
- **Inputs**:
    - `client`: An instance of `RpcClient` used to interact with the Solana blockchain and retrieve the current slot number.
    - `n`: A `u64` integer representing the number of slots to wait for before resuming execution.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Retrieve the current slot number from the Solana blockchain using the `client.get_slot()` method.
    - Calculate the target slot by adding the input `n` to the current slot number.
    - Enter a loop that continuously retrieves the current slot number.
    - Break out of the loop once the current slot number is greater than or equal to the target slot number.
- **Output**: This function does not return any value; it simply pauses execution until the specified number of slots have passed.
