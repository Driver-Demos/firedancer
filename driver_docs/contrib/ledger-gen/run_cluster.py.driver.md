# Purpose
This Python script is designed to automate the setup and management of a Solana test cluster, which can be used for testing and development purposes. It provides functionality to create both single-node and multi-node Solana clusters by building and deploying Solana binaries from a specified source directory. The script is structured to handle various tasks such as building the necessary Solana components, generating cryptographic keys for the cluster nodes, and configuring the nodes to operate as validators within the cluster. It also includes mechanisms to monitor the cluster's status and manage the lifecycle of the validator processes.

The script is intended to be executed as a standalone command-line tool, as indicated by its use of the `argparse` module to parse command-line arguments. It defines several asynchronous functions to perform tasks like building Solana binaries, generating cluster keys, and running validator nodes. The script leverages Python's `asyncio` library to manage asynchronous operations, allowing for efficient handling of subprocesses and I/O operations. The script's primary purpose is to facilitate the creation and management of test environments for Solana, making it a valuable tool for developers working on Solana-based applications or testing new features in a controlled environment.
