# Purpose
This source code file is designed to identify potential mismatches between specific macro invocations related to layout and scratch operations in a C++ codebase. The file defines two primary classes, `LayoutOption` and `ScratchOption`, both of which extend the `MacroInvocation` class. These classes are used to encapsulate and analyze macro invocations such as `FD_LAYOUT_APPEND`, `FD_LAYOUT_INIT`, `FD_LAYOUT_FINI`, and their corresponding scratch counterparts `FD_SCRATCH_ALLOC_APPEND`, `FD_SCRATCH_ALLOC_INIT`, and `FD_SCRATCH_ALLOC_FINI`. The purpose of these classes is to facilitate a syntactic comparison between these macros to ensure they are used consistently and correctly in the code.

The file provides a mechanism to check the relative positioning of these macros within the source code by defining methods like `getAbove()` and `getBelow()`, which determine the order of macro invocations in relation to each other. Additionally, the `syntaxCompare` predicate is used to compare the arguments of these macros, ensuring that they match in a syntactic sense, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the layout and scratch operations. The `matches` predicate further refines this comparison by specifying the conditions under which a `LayoutOption` matches a `ScratchOption`.

Overall, this code serves as a static analysis tool that issues warnings when it detects mismatches between the layout and scratch macros, which could lead to potential issues in the application's memory management or initialization processes. By identifying these mismatches, developers can address inconsistencies and ensure that the macros are used in a manner that aligns with the intended design and functionality of the software.

# Data Structures

### LayoutOption
- **Type**: `class`
- **Members**:
    - `getAbove`: A method that retrieves the LayoutOption instance located above the current instance in the same file.
    - `getBelow`: A method that retrieves the LayoutOption instance located below the current instance in the same file.
    - `syntaxCompare`: A private predicate that compares the syntax of expanded arguments between two LayoutOption instances.
    - `matches`: A predicate that checks if a ScratchOption instance matches the current LayoutOption instance based on macro names and syntax.
- **Description**: The LayoutOption class is a specialized data structure that extends MacroInvocation, designed to handle and compare macro invocations related to layout operations in a codebase. It provides methods to find related LayoutOption instances above or below the current instance in the same file, ensuring that the layout macros are correctly aligned and matched with corresponding scratch macros. The class includes a syntax comparison mechanism to ensure that arguments are consistent across related macros, and a matching predicate to verify the alignment between layout and scratch options.


---
### ScratchOption
- **Type**: `class`
- **Members**:
    - `ScratchOption`: Constructor that initializes the macro names and checks if the location is included.
    - `getAbove`: Method to find the LayoutOption above the current ScratchOption in the same file.
    - `getBelow`: Method to find the LayoutOption below the current ScratchOption in the same file.
- **Description**: The ScratchOption class is a specialized data structure that extends MacroInvocation, designed to handle specific macro names related to scratch allocation operations, such as FD_SCRATCH_ALLOC_APPEND, FD_SCRATCH_ALLOC_INIT, and FD_SCRATCH_ALLOC_FINI. It provides methods to identify corresponding LayoutOption instances that are positioned above or below the current instance within the same file, ensuring that the macros are correctly aligned and matched. This class is part of a system to detect mismatches between scratch and layout macros, which can lead to potential issues in code layout and execution.
