# Purpose
This source code file defines a static analysis rule for identifying a specific coding issue related to error handling in C++ programs. The primary functionality of this code is to detect instances where a function that returns an error code is called, but the return value is not utilized or checked. This is a common issue in software development, as ignoring error codes can lead to unhandled exceptions and unpredictable program behavior. The code is structured to identify such occurrences and flag them as warnings, with a low precision level, indicating that the rule may produce false positives.

The code is organized around a class `ErrFunction`, which extends a `Function` class, and a query that identifies function calls (`FunctionCall`) where the return value is discarded. The query checks several conditions to ensure that the function call is not part of a return statement, assignment, declaration, loop, macro expansion, or conditional statement. Additionally, it excludes calls within files that match a specific naming pattern, such as test or fuzz files, which are often used for testing purposes and may intentionally ignore error codes.

This file is part of a static analysis tool or framework, likely used to enforce coding standards or improve code quality by identifying potential issues in source code. It does not define a public API or external interface but rather contributes to the internal logic of the analysis tool by specifying a rule for error handling practices. The code imports modules `cpp` and `rettypes`, which suggests it leverages existing libraries or frameworks to analyze C++ code and handle return types.
