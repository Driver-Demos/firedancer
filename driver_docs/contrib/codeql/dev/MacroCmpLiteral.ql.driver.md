# Purpose
This code is a script designed to identify specific patterns in C++ code, particularly focusing on functions that return a defined integer constant and compare it to a literal value at the point of invocation. It is part of a static analysis tool, likely used to enhance code maintainability and readability by flagging potential issues or anti-patterns. The script is structured to detect when a function returns a constant value and is immediately compared to a literal, which might indicate redundant or unnecessary code logic that could be simplified.

The script uses a combination of predicates and logical conditions to perform its analysis. The `callOriginated` predicate is a key component, determining whether a function call is the origin of a particular element, such as a variable or a comparison operation. The main logic is encapsulated in a query that checks for the existence of specific conditions: a function returning a constant value and a comparison operation involving a literal. The script uses constructs like `MacroReturn` and `LiteralReturn` to identify these return types and their enclosing functions, ensuring that the analysis is precise and targets the correct code patterns.

This code is not an executable or a library but rather a rule or query intended to be used within a static analysis framework. It does not define public APIs or external interfaces but instead provides a specific rule for identifying a particular code pattern. The script is tagged with attributes like `maintainability` and `readability`, indicating its purpose in improving these aspects of the codebase it analyzes.
