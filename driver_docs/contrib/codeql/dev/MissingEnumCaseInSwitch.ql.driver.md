# Purpose
This code is a part of a static analysis tool designed to identify potential issues in C++ code, specifically focusing on switch statements that handle enum types. The primary functionality of this code is to detect switch statements that are missing cases for some enum constants and do not include a default case. This situation can lead to logic errors, as not all possible enum values are accounted for, potentially causing unexpected behavior in the program.

The code defines a problem detection rule with a medium precision level and a warning severity. It uses a query to filter and select switch statements that meet specific criteria: they lack a default case, have missing enum cases, and the proportion of missing cases is less than 30% of the total cases. The code then identifies and selects these problematic switch statements, providing a warning message that specifies which enum case is missing. This functionality is tagged with reliability and correctness, and it is associated with the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) identifier CWE-478, which relates to missing default cases in switch statements.

Overall, this code is a part of a broader static analysis framework, likely intended to be used as a library or module within a larger system. It does not define public APIs or external interfaces but rather contributes to the internal logic of the analysis tool by providing a specific rule for detecting a common programming oversight in C++ switch statements.
