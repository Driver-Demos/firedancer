# Purpose
This source code file is designed to analyze and identify potential issues in C++ code related to the improper use of const and pure function attributes. It defines a set of classes and logic to check if functions marked as const or pure are calling other functions that are not const or pure, which could lead to unexpected side effects or incorrect assumptions about the function's behavior. The code is structured to provide a warning when such a situation is detected, indicating a potential problem in the codebase.

The file contains several abstract and concrete classes, such as `RFunc`, `PureFunc`, `ConstFunc`, `ShouldBeFunc`, and `ShouldBePure`. These classes are used to categorize functions based on their attributes and relationships. The `PureFunc` and `ConstFunc` classes represent functions that are explicitly marked as pure or const, respectively. The `ShouldBePure` class is used to identify functions that should be pure but are calling non-pure functions, which is the core functionality of this code. The logic within these classes checks the relationships between functions and their attributes to determine if a warning should be issued.

The code is not an executable or a library but rather a static analysis tool or script that is likely part of a larger code quality or linting framework. It does not define public APIs or external interfaces but instead focuses on internal logic to perform its analysis. The output of this code is a warning message that highlights the function relationships and their const/pure status, helping developers identify and rectify potential issues in their code.

# Data Structures

### RFunc
- **Type**: `abstract class`
- **Members**:
    - `PureFunc`: A subclass of RFunc that sets an attribute name to 'pure'.
    - `ConstFunc`: A subclass of RFunc that sets an attribute name to 'const'.
- **Description**: RFunc is an abstract class that extends the Function class, serving as a base for defining functions that are either pure or const. It is used to categorize functions based on their purity or constness, with subclasses like PureFunc and ConstFunc providing specific implementations that set attributes to indicate their respective types. This structure is part of a system that checks for calls to non-const or non-pure functions from functions marked as const or pure, helping to enforce function purity and constness in code.


---
### PureFunc
- **Type**: `class`
- **Members**:
    - `PureFunc`: Constructor that sets the attribute name to 'pure'.
- **Description**: The `PureFunc` class is a specialized type of `RFunc`, which itself extends the `Function` class. It represents a function that is marked as 'pure', meaning it does not produce side effects and its return value is only determined by its input values. The constructor of `PureFunc` sets an attribute's name to 'pure', indicating its nature. This class is part of a system that checks for calls to non-const or non-pure functions within functions that are marked as const or pure, helping to identify potential issues in code where purity or constancy is expected.


---
### ConstFunc
- **Type**: `class`
- **Members**:
    - `ConstFunc`: Constructor that sets the function attribute name to 'const'.
- **Description**: The `ConstFunc` class is a specialized type of `RFunc`, which itself extends the `Function` class. It represents a function that is marked as 'const', indicating that it should not modify any state. The constructor of `ConstFunc` sets the attribute name of the function to 'const', which is used to identify and enforce the constness of the function within the codebase. This class is part of a system that checks for calls to non-const or non-pure functions from functions that are supposed to be const or pure, helping to maintain the integrity of function purity and constness in the code.


---
### ShouldBeFunc
- **Type**: `abstract class`
- **Members**:
    - `off`: A member of type Function used to store a reference to another function.
- **Description**: The `ShouldBeFunc` is an abstract class that extends the `Function` class, serving as a base for functions that should adhere to certain constraints, such as being pure or const. It is part of a system that checks for non-const or non-pure functions being called by functions marked as const or pure, ensuring code quality and adherence to function purity constraints. The `ShouldBePure` class, which extends `ShouldBeFunc`, includes logic to determine if a function is improperly calling another function, and it uses the `off` member to reference the function being checked.


---
### ShouldBePure
- **Type**: `class`
- **Members**:
    - `off`: A member of type Function that represents a function being checked for purity or constness.
- **Description**: The `ShouldBePure` class is a specialized data structure that extends `ShouldBeFunc` and is used to determine if a function, represented by the `off` member, is being called by a function that should be pure or const. It checks the type of the function and its call context to ensure it adheres to purity or constness constraints, particularly in the context of source files matching a specific path pattern. This class is part of a system that identifies potential issues with function purity and constness in code analysis.


# Functions

---
### directOrNot
The function `directOrNot` determines whether a given function is a known non-const/non-pure function or is called by such a function.
- **Inputs**:
    - `off`: A `Function` object that is checked to determine if it is a known non-const/non-pure function or is called by one.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function checks if the input `off` is an instance of `RFunc`, which represents a known non-const/non-pure function.
    - If `off` is an instance of `RFunc`, the result is set to the string 'is'.
    - If `off` is an instance of `ShouldBeFunc`, the result is set to the string 'is called by a'.
- **Output**: A string indicating whether the function is a known non-const/non-pure function ('is') or is called by such a function ('is called by a').
