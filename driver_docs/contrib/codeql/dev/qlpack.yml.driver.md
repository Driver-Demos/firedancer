# Purpose
This YAML file is a configuration file for a software package named "asymmetric-research/fd-nightly-queries" with version "0.0.1". It specifies that the package uses a C++ extractor and has a setting to warn on implicit 'this' usage. Additionally, it declares a dependency on the "codeql/cpp-all" package, allowing any version.
