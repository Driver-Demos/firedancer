# Purpose
This code is a query written in a domain-specific language used for static analysis, specifically targeting C++ codebases. Its primary purpose is to identify instances where a function call passes an array whose size is smaller than the size expected by the function's parameter. This situation can lead to potential memory access violations, as the function may attempt to access elements beyond the bounds of the provided array, leading to undefined behavior or security vulnerabilities.

The query imports necessary modules such as `cpp`, `semmle.code.cpp.commons.Buffer`, and `filter`, which provide the foundational elements and utilities needed to analyze C++ code structures and perform filtering operations. The query defines a set of conditions using logical expressions to match function calls (`FunctionCall c`) where the size of the argument array (`argType`) is less than the size of the parameter array (`paramType`). It ensures that the base types of the arrays are of the same size and excludes cases where the array size might be variable or where there are inconsistent declarations.

The result of the query is a warning message that highlights the mismatch, specifying the sizes of the arrays involved and the function expecting the larger array. This message is intended to aid developers in identifying and rectifying potential reliability issues in their code. The query is marked with metadata indicating its severity level as a warning, its high precision, and its relevance to code reliability, making it a valuable tool for improving code quality and preventing runtime errors.
