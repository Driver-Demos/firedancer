# Purpose
This code appears to be a query script, likely written for a static analysis tool or a code quality checker, designed to identify potential issues in C++ code. It specifically targets binary bitwise operations that are used in conjunction with comparison operations, where the comparison operation is not parenthesized. The purpose of this script is to flag these instances as warnings, suggesting that the lack of parentheses might lead to unintended precedence issues, which could result in logical errors in the code. The script is not an executable or a library but rather a rule definition that can be imported and used by a larger analysis framework to enhance code quality by highlighting potential precedence-related problems.
