# Purpose
This code file is a part of a static analysis tool designed to detect a specific type of programming error in C++ code, known as "double leave." The primary purpose of this file is to identify instances where an object is operated on without being properly joined, which can lead to issues in code correctness and maintainability. The file defines a path-problem with a high precision warning severity, indicating that it is focused on identifying potential logical errors in the code that could lead to resource mismanagement or other unintended behaviors.

The code imports several modules, including `cpp`, `GenericDoubleFree`, and `semmle.code.cpp.dataflow.new.DataFlow`, which suggests that it leverages existing libraries and frameworks to perform data flow analysis. The core functionality is encapsulated in the `Flow` module, which is configured to track the flow of data through the program using the `DoubleFreeConfig` with specific match functions, `matchLeave` and `matchJoin`. These functions use regular expressions to identify patterns in the code that correspond to "leave" and "join" operations, respectively.

The file defines a query that selects paths in the code where a "leave" operation occurs without a corresponding "join" operation, spanning different lines of code. This is achieved by analyzing the flow of data between `source` and `sink` nodes, ensuring that they are not on the same line, which helps in pinpointing the exact location of the potential error. The result of this analysis is a warning message that highlights the "double leave" issue, aiding developers in identifying and rectifying these errors to improve code quality.

# Functions

---
### matchLeave
The `matchLeave` function captures and returns the substring of a given string that precedes the suffix '_leave'.
- **Inputs**:
    - `x`: A string input that is expected to contain the suffix '_leave'.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function uses a regular expression to search for a pattern in the input string 'x'.
    - It captures the substring that precedes the '_leave' suffix using the `regexpCapture` method.
- **Output**: The function returns the substring of 'x' that precedes the '_leave' suffix.


---
### matchJoin
The `matchJoin` function captures and returns the substring of a given string that precedes the suffix '_join'.
- **Inputs**:
    - `x`: A string input that is expected to contain the suffix '_join'.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function uses a regular expression to search for a pattern in the input string 'x'.
    - It captures the substring that precedes the '_join' suffix using the `regexpCapture` method.
    - The captured substring is stored in the variable 'result'.
- **Output**: The function returns the substring of the input string 'x' that precedes the '_join' suffix.
