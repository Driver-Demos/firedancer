# Purpose
This code is a query script likely intended for use with a static analysis tool, such as Semgrep or CodeQL, to identify potential issues in C++ codebases. It provides narrow functionality by specifically targeting function calls that are expected to handle format strings but are not annotated as such, which could lead to security vulnerabilities or bugs if format strings are improperly handled. The script imports a C++ library and uses pattern matching to find string literals that resemble format strings being passed to functions that lack a "format" attribute. It then selects these functions for reporting, issuing a warning about the potential issue. This script is not an executable or a library but rather a rule or query designed to be integrated into a larger static analysis framework to enhance code quality and security.
