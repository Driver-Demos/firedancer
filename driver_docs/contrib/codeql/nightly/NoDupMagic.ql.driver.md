# Purpose
This code appears to be part of a static analysis tool or a code quality checker, specifically designed to identify and warn about duplicate magic constants in C++ code. It provides a narrow functionality focused on detecting potential issues related to type confusion that can arise when different types share the same magic constant. The code defines a class `MagicConstant` that extends a `Macro`, suggesting it is part of a larger framework or library for code analysis. The logic within the class checks for instances where two magic constants are identical in their body or fully converted expression, and it issues a warning if such a duplication is found. This file is likely intended to be part of a rule set or plugin for a code analysis tool, rather than a standalone executable or a library for general use.
