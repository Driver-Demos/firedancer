# Purpose
The provided content is a metadata configuration for a static analysis tool, likely used to detect potential issues in C++ codebases. This configuration defines a specific analysis rule named "Double delete," which targets the problem of non-idempotent delete functions. The rule is categorized as a "path-problem" with a severity level of "warning" and is tagged for "correctness" and "maintainability." The configuration imports necessary modules and defines a data flow analysis using the `Flow::PathGraph` to identify paths in the code where a delete operation might be incorrectly paired with a new operation, potentially leading to double deletion issues. The analysis excludes test files and focuses on ensuring that delete operations are correctly matched with their corresponding new operations, enhancing code reliability and maintainability.
