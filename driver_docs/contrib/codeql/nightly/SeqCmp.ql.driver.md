# Purpose
This code is a static analysis rule written in a domain-specific language, likely for a tool that analyzes C++ code. Its primary purpose is to identify instances where sequence numbers are compared using relational operators other than the provided `fd_seq_*` functions, which are presumably designed for this specific purpose. The rule is categorized as a problem with a warning severity and low precision, indicating that it may generate false positives but is still useful for identifying potential issues in the codebase.

The code defines a predicate `include` that filters locations to those within the "src/" directory, excluding files with base names starting with "fd_cstr". It also defines a class `SeqNum` that extends `Variable`, identifying variables with names containing "seq" and located in the specified directory. The main logic of the rule uses these definitions to find pairs of sequence number variables that are compared using relational operations other than equality (`==`) or inequality (`!=`). The rule suggests using specific functions (`fd_seq_lt`, `fd_seq_le`, `fd_seq_ge`, `fd_seq_gt`) for these comparisons to ensure correctness and consistency.

Overall, this code is a part of a larger static analysis framework, providing a specific check to enforce best practices in handling sequence number comparisons. It does not define public APIs or external interfaces but rather contributes to code quality by flagging potentially incorrect or suboptimal code patterns.

### SeqNum
- **Type**: `class`
- **Members**:
    - `SeqNum`: A class that extends the Variable class and is used to identify sequence numbers based on their name and location.
- **Description**: The SeqNum class is a specialized data structure that extends the Variable class, designed to identify and work with sequence numbers in code. It uses a constructor to match sequence numbers by their name pattern and location, ensuring they are included in specific source files while excluding certain base names. The class is part of a system that checks for relational comparisons of sequence numbers, encouraging the use of specific functions for comparison to maintain consistency and correctness in the codebase.
