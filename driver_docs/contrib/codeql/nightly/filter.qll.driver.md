# Purpose
This code is a script written in a domain-specific language, likely for use with a code analysis tool, and it provides a narrow functionality focused on filtering files. It defines a predicate function named `included` that determines whether a given file location should be included in an analysis based on its file path. Specifically, it excludes files located in directories with paths that start with "agave/". This suggests that the code is part of a larger configuration or rule set for a code analysis tool, where certain files or directories are intentionally omitted from analysis to focus on relevant code. The use of `import cpp` indicates that it is designed to work with C++ codebases.
