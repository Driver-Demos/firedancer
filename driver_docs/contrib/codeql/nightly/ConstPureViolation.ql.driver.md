# Purpose
This source code file defines a static analysis tool designed to identify violations of `const` and `pure` function attributes in C++ code. The primary functionality of this code is to detect when functions marked with these attributes improperly access pointers, which can lead to undefined behavior or incorrect assumptions about the function's behavior. The code is structured around a set of classes and predicates that encapsulate the logic for identifying these violations.

The code includes an abstract class `RestrictedFunc`, which serves as a base for specific function types that have restrictions, such as `ConstFunc` and `PureFunc`. These derived classes implement the logic to determine if a function violates its attribute constraints. The `isDref` predicate is a key component, used to check if a parameter is accessed in a way that violates the `const` or `pure` attribute. The `ConstFunc` class checks for direct pointer dereferencing, while the `PureFunc` class checks for any potentially impure variable access.

This file is not an executable but rather a part of a static analysis framework, likely intended to be used as a plugin or module within a larger code analysis tool. It defines a specific problem type with high precision and a warning severity level, indicating its role in ensuring code quality and adherence to function attribute contracts. The code provides a public interface for selecting functions that violate these constraints, which can be used to generate warnings or reports for developers to address.

# Data Structures

---
### RestrictedFunc
- **Type**: `abstract class`
- **Members**:
    - `getAPointerParam`: Returns a parameter of the function that is a pointer.
    - `isViolated`: A predicate that checks if the function violates its restrictions.
- **Description**: The `RestrictedFunc` is an abstract class that extends the `Function` class, designed to represent functions with specific restrictions, such as being `const` or `pure`. It provides a method to retrieve pointer parameters and a predicate to determine if the function violates its restrictions. Subclasses like `ConstFunc` and `PureFunc` implement the `isViolated` predicate to check for specific violations related to their attributes.


---
### ConstFunc
- **Type**: `class`
- **Members**:
    - `ConstFunc`: Constructor that initializes the function with the 'const' attribute.
    - `isViolated`: Predicate that checks if a pointer parameter is accessed in a way that violates the 'const' attribute.
- **Description**: The `ConstFunc` class is a specialized type of `RestrictedFunc` that represents functions attributed with the 'const' keyword. It overrides the `isViolated` predicate to determine if the function accesses a pointer parameter in a manner that contravenes the 'const' attribute, indicating a potential issue in the code. This class is part of a system designed to identify and warn about improper pointer access in functions marked as 'const' or 'pure'.


---
### PureFunc
- **Type**: `class`
- **Members**:
    - `PureFunc`: A class that extends RestrictedFunc and represents a function attributed with 'pure'.
- **Description**: The PureFunc class is a specialized data structure that extends the RestrictedFunc class, representing functions that are marked with the 'pure' attribute. It overrides the isViolated predicate to determine if a function accesses a pointer in a way that may violate the 'pure' attribute by checking if any parameter that is a pointer is accessed in a potentially impure manner. This class is part of a system to identify and warn about improper pointer access in functions that are supposed to be pure.
