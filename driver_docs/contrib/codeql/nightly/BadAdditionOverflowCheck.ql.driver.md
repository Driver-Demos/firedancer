# Purpose
This source code file is a part of a static analysis tool or a code quality checker, specifically designed to identify a particular problem related to integer overflow in C++ code. The file defines a rule or a check that targets a common mistake in checking for overflow in integer addition operations. The issue arises when the result of an addition is automatically promoted to a larger type, making simple comparisons against one of the operands ineffective for detecting overflow. The code is tagged with high severity levels for both general problem severity and security, indicating its importance in maintaining code reliability and security.

The file imports necessary modules and components such as `cpp`, `BadAdditionOverflowCheck`, and `filter`, which suggests that it leverages existing libraries or frameworks to perform its analysis. The core functionality is encapsulated in a query that uses a combination of relational operations and expressions to identify instances of the problematic pattern in the codebase. The query checks for specific conditions using `badAdditionOverflowCheck` and filters results based on their location in the code, ultimately selecting and reporting the problematic comparisons along with their file paths.

This code is not an executable or a library intended for direct use in applications but rather a component of a larger static analysis system. It defines a specific check that can be integrated into a broader suite of code quality checks, focusing on reliability, correctness, and security. The use of tags such as `reliability`, `correctness`, and `security`, along with references to external standards like CWE-190 and CWE-192, highlights its role in enforcing coding standards and preventing common vulnerabilities.
