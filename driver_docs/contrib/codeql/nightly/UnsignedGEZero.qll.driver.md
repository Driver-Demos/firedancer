# Purpose
This source code file defines a library for identifying and handling a specific code pattern known as "UnsignedGEZero" within C++ codebases. The primary functionality of this library is to detect instances where an unsigned integer is compared to zero using relational operations like greater than or equal to (>=) or less than or equal to (<=). The library is designed to be used in conjunction with another query, "PointlessComparison," which is a more general query that also identifies the "UnsignedGEZero" pattern among other similar patterns. By using this library, developers can avoid redundant alerts for the same issue when both queries are employed.

The code is structured around a few key components. It includes a class `ConstantZero` that represents the constant value zero, which is used in comparisons. The `lookForUnsignedAt` predicate is a crucial part of the logic, as it recursively checks if a given relational operation involves an unsigned integer being compared to zero. The `UnsignedGEZero` class extends `ComparisonOperation` and encapsulates the logic for identifying when an unsigned integer is involved in such a comparison. Additionally, the `unsignedGEZero` predicate is defined to generate a message alerting the user to the presence of a "pointless comparison" when an unsigned integer is compared to zero, ensuring that the alert is not triggered by macro invocations or template instantiations.

Overall, this file provides a focused and specialized functionality aimed at improving code quality by identifying potentially redundant or unnecessary comparisons in C++ code. It is not a standalone executable but rather a library intended to be integrated into a larger code analysis framework, providing a specific query capability that can be leveraged by other components or queries within the system.

# Data Structures

### ConstantZero
- **Type**: `class`
- **Members**:
    - `ConstantZero`: A class that extends Expr and represents a constant expression with a value of zero.
- **Description**: The `ConstantZero` class is a specialized data structure that extends the `Expr` class, representing a constant expression with a value of zero. It is used within the context of the `UnsignedGEZero` query to identify expressions that are constant and equal to zero, particularly in scenarios where unsigned comparisons to zero are being analyzed. This class plays a crucial role in ensuring that such comparisons are correctly identified and handled, avoiding redundant alerts in the context of the `PointlessComparison` query.

### UnsignedGEZero
- **Type**: `class`
- **Members**:
    - `UnsignedGEZero`: A class that extends ComparisonOperation to identify unsigned expressions compared to zero.
- **Description**: The `UnsignedGEZero` class is a specialized data structure that extends the `ComparisonOperation` class. It is designed to identify expressions where an unsigned integral type is compared to zero using relational operations. The class utilizes a predicate `lookForUnsignedAt` to determine if a given expression is unsigned and involved in a comparison with zero. This data structure is part of a library that helps in identifying and avoiding redundant or pointless comparisons in code, particularly focusing on unsigned values being compared to zero.
