# Purpose
This code is a script written in a domain-specific language, likely used for static analysis or code quality checks. It defines a problem related to "footprint bounding," where certain data structures (structs) do not fit within predefined memory footprints specified by macros. The script is designed to identify and warn about these mismatches, providing a high-precision warning when a struct's size exceeds the size defined by its corresponding macro. The code is not an executable or a library but rather a rule or query that is part of a larger static analysis framework.

The primary technical component of this script is the `fitsInFootprint` predicate, which checks if a given struct fits within the size defined by a macro. The script uses this predicate to evaluate multiple struct-macro pairs, each representing a specific data structure and its expected memory footprint. The script iterates over these pairs, checking if the struct's size is within the bounds set by the macro. If not, it selects the struct name and a message indicating the mismatch, which can be used to generate warnings or reports.

Overall, this code is a collection of checks focused on ensuring that data structures conform to their expected memory constraints. It is part of a broader effort to maintain code quality and prevent potential issues related to memory usage, which can be critical in systems where memory efficiency and predictability are important. The script does not define public APIs or external interfaces but serves as an internal tool for developers to identify and address footprint-related issues in their codebase.
