# Purpose
This code is a static analysis module designed to identify potential issues in C++ code where calls to the `mmap` function are not properly checked for failure. The primary purpose of this file is to define a custom data flow analysis configuration that detects when the return value of `mmap` is not compared against `MAP_FAILED` (which is typically represented by `-1`). This is crucial because failing to check the return value of `mmap` can lead to undefined behavior if the memory mapping operation fails and the program continues to use an invalid memory address.

The code imports necessary modules for C++ data flow analysis and defines a configuration module named `Config` that implements the `DataFlow::ConfigSig` interface. Within this module, two predicates, `isSource` and `isSink`, are defined. The `isSource` predicate identifies nodes in the data flow graph where the `mmap` function is called, while the `isSink` predicate identifies nodes where the result of `mmap` is compared against `-1`. The analysis then checks for paths in the code where a source node (an `mmap` call) does not lead to a sink node (a comparison with `-1`), indicating a potential issue.

The file concludes with a query that selects instances where there is no valid flow path from a source to a sink, effectively flagging these as warnings. This module is part of a broader static analysis framework and is intended to be used as a plugin or extension to identify and warn developers about unchecked `mmap` calls, thereby improving code robustness and reliability.
