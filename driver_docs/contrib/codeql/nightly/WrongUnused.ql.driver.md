# Purpose
This source code file is a part of a static analysis tool designed to identify and report on a specific coding issue within C++ codebases. The primary functionality of this file is to detect parameters in functions that are marked as "unused" but are actually being used in the code. This is a common issue that can lead to misunderstandings about the code's functionality and potentially hide bugs or inefficiencies. The file defines a problem with high precision and no severity, indicating that while the issue is noteworthy, it may not directly lead to critical errors.

The code is structured around a few key components. It imports necessary modules for C++ analysis and filtering, and defines predicates and classes to encapsulate the logic for identifying the misuse of "unused" parameter annotations. The `isVoidCast` predicate checks if a variable access is cast to void, which is a common way to intentionally mark a parameter as unused. The `MarkedUnusedParam` abstract class and its subclasses, `AnnotatedUnusedParam` and `VoidCastUnusedParam`, encapsulate the logic for identifying parameters that are incorrectly marked as unused. These classes use predicates to determine if a parameter is genuinely unused or if it is being accessed in a way that contradicts its annotation.

The file concludes with a query that selects parameters fitting the criteria of being marked as unused but actually used, excluding those within macro expansions or specific files known to contain unimplemented stubs. This query is part of a larger framework that likely integrates with other analysis tools to provide developers with insights into potential code quality issues. The file does not define public APIs or external interfaces but rather contributes to the internal logic of a static analysis system.

# Data Structures

---
### MarkedUnusedParam
- **Type**: `abstract class`
- **Members**:
    - `isOffending`: A predicate that checks if a parameter marked as unused is actually used.
- **Description**: The `MarkedUnusedParam` is an abstract class extending `Parameter`, designed to identify parameters that are marked as unused but are actually utilized in the code. It includes a predicate `isOffending` that determines if a parameter is improperly marked by checking for variable accesses that are not void casts and are not within macro expansions. This class serves as a base for more specific classes like `AnnotatedUnusedParam` and `VoidCastUnusedParam`, which further refine the conditions under which a parameter is considered improperly marked.


---
### AnnotatedUnusedParam
- **Type**: `class`
- **Members**:
    - `AnnotatedUnusedParam`: Constructor for the AnnotatedUnusedParam class that checks if a parameter is marked with the 'unused' attribute.
- **Description**: The AnnotatedUnusedParam class is a specialized data structure that extends the MarkedUnusedParam class, designed to identify parameters in code that are marked as 'unused' but are actually being used. It includes a constructor that specifically checks for the 'unused' attribute on parameters, helping to flag potential issues where parameters are incorrectly annotated, thus aiding in code analysis and quality assurance.


---
### VoidCastUnusedParam
- **Type**: `class`
- **Members**:
    - `VoidCastUnusedParam`: A class that extends MarkedUnusedParam to identify parameters marked as unused but are actually used with a void cast.
- **Description**: The VoidCastUnusedParam class is a specialized data structure that extends the MarkedUnusedParam class. It is designed to identify parameters that are marked as unused but are actually used in the code, specifically when they are accessed through a void cast. The class constructor checks for the existence of such variable accesses and ensures they are not part of a macro expansion. This class is part of a system to detect and report parameters that are incorrectly marked as unused, helping to maintain code quality and correctness.
