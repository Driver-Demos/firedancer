# Purpose
This YAML file is a configuration file for a CodeQL query pack. It specifies the name and version of the query pack, the language extractor to be used (C++), and a setting to warn on implicit 'this' usage. It also lists a dependency on the 'codeql/cpp-all' package, allowing for any version.
