# Purpose
This source code file defines a static analysis rule aimed at identifying and suggesting improvements for specific uses of the `memcpy` function in C or C++ code. The rule targets instances where `memcpy` is used to copy data between two pointers, and where a simple assignment could achieve the same result. The rationale behind this suggestion is that using `memcpy` in such cases can lead to bugs due to weaker typing, whereas an assignment is more straightforward and less error-prone. The rule is categorized under maintainability and readability, indicating its focus on improving code quality and clarity.

The code is structured to extend a class named `Function`, specifically targeting functions with global or standard names like `memcpy`, `fd_memcpy`, or `__builtin_memcpy`. It uses a query-like syntax to filter function calls that match specific criteria: the call must be included in the analysis, not be part of a macro expansion, and the arguments must satisfy certain type conditions. Specifically, the third argument must be a `SizeofTypeOperator`, and the types of the first two arguments must match the type operand of the `SizeofTypeOperator`. When these conditions are met, the rule selects the call and generates a message suggesting that the `memcpy` call could be rewritten as an assignment.

This file is part of a static analysis tool or framework, likely used to enforce coding standards or improve code quality by identifying potential issues in source code. It does not define a public API or external interface but rather contributes to the internal logic of a larger system that performs code analysis. The focus on a specific pattern of `memcpy` usage suggests that the file provides narrow functionality within the broader context of code quality assurance.

### MemcpyFunction
- **Type**: `class`
- **Members**:
    - `MemcpyFunction`: A class that extends the Function class to identify calls to the `memcpy` function or its variants.
- **Description**: The `MemcpyFunction` class is designed to identify instances where the `memcpy` function or its variants (`fd_memcpy`, `__builtin_memcpy`) are used in code. It extends a base `Function` class and is used in conjunction with a query to detect when a `memcpy` call could be replaced with a simple assignment, improving code maintainability and readability by avoiding the potential pitfalls of weaker typing associated with `memcpy`. The class checks for specific conditions, such as matching types and the use of the `SizeofTypeOperator`, to ensure that the replacement is valid.
