# Purpose
This code is a script designed to perform static analysis on C++ code, specifically targeting custom runtime logging format strings to ensure they do not exceed predefined buffer sizes. The script is written in a domain-specific language that appears to be used for querying and analyzing code, likely as part of a larger static analysis tool or framework. The primary functionality of this script is to identify instances where certain logging functions (`fd_log_collector_printf_dangerous_max_127`, `fd_log_collector_printf_dangerous_128_to_2k`, and `fd_log_collector_printf_inefficient_max_512`) are used in a way that could potentially lead to buffer overflows or inefficient memory usage due to the size of the formatted output.

The script imports a module named `cpp`, indicating that it is designed to work with C++ codebases. It defines a set of conditions using logical expressions to check the maximum converted length of format strings used in specific function calls. The conditions are structured to identify potential issues based on the estimated size of the formatted output, which is compared against predefined thresholds (e.g., greater than 127 bytes, less than 512 bytes, etc.). If a potential issue is detected, the script selects the function call and generates a warning message that includes the estimated size of the formatted output and the reason for the estimation.

Overall, this code provides a narrow but critical functionality within a static analysis context, focusing on ensuring the safety and efficiency of logging operations in C++ applications. It does not define public APIs or external interfaces but rather serves as a rule or check within a larger analysis framework to help developers identify and address potential issues related to format string usage in their code.
