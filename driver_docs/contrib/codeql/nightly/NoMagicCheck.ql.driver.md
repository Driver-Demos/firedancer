# Purpose
This code is a static analysis query written in a domain-specific language for analyzing C++ code. Its primary purpose is to identify functions that handle objects with a "magic" field but fail to properly check or reset this field during destruction or cleanup operations. The code is structured to detect potential issues in functions that are expected to manage memory or resource cleanup, specifically those that should verify the integrity of a "magic" field and reset it to prevent memory corruption vulnerabilities.

The code defines several classes that extend specific operations: `MagicAccess`, `MagicCmp`, and `MagicNulling`. These classes are used to identify access to the "magic" field, comparisons involving the "magic" field, and assignments that nullify the "magic" field, respectively. The `CheckFunction` class is central to the query, as it encapsulates the logic for identifying functions that should manage the "magic" field. It includes predicates to determine if a function performs the necessary comparison and nullification operations on the "magic" field.

The query concludes by selecting functions that do not meet the criteria defined in the `CheckFunction` class, specifically those that do not check or nullify the "magic" field as expected. This selection is accompanied by a warning message indicating the need for proper handling of the "magic" field. The code is intended to be used as part of a static analysis tool to improve code safety and robustness by ensuring that functions adhere to best practices for managing memory and resources.
