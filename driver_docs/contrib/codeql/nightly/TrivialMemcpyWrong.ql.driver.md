# Purpose
This code is a static analysis rule designed to identify potential errors in the use of the `memcpy` function within C or C++ codebases. The primary focus of this rule is to detect instances where the size argument passed to `memcpy` might be incorrect due to a mismatch in the sizes of the source and destination types. The rule is implemented using a domain-specific language for code analysis, likely intended to be used with a tool that processes and analyzes C/C++ source code to ensure correctness and prevent common programming errors.

The code defines a class `MemcpyFunction` that extends a `Function` class, identifying functions with global or standard names like `memcpy`, `fd_memcpy`, or `__builtin_memcpy`. Another class, `NotVoidChar`, is defined to filter out types that are neither `CharType` nor `VoidType`. The rule then specifies conditions under which a `memcpy` call is flagged: it checks if the size argument is derived from a `sizeof` operator and compares the sizes of the base types of the source and destination pointers. If there is a discrepancy in these sizes, the rule selects the call and generates a message indicating the potential error.

This code is part of a broader static analysis framework, likely used to enforce coding standards and improve code quality by catching potential bugs at compile time. It does not define a public API or external interface but rather serves as an internal rule within a static analysis tool, focusing on correctness by ensuring that `memcpy` is used with appropriately sized arguments.

### MemcpyFunction
- **Type**: `class`
- **Members**:
    - `MemcpyFunction`: A class that extends Function to identify memcpy function calls.
- **Description**: The `MemcpyFunction` class is a specialized class that extends the `Function` class to identify and handle calls to the `memcpy` function, including its variants like `fd_memcpy` and `__builtin_memcpy`. It is used in conjunction with other classes and logic to detect potential issues with the size argument in `memcpy` calls, ensuring that the sizes of the source and destination types match the size specified in the `sizeof` operator. This class is part of a larger system designed to catch and report errors related to incorrect usage of the `memcpy` function.

### NotVoidChar
- **Type**: `class`
- **Members**:
    - `NotVoidChar`: A constructor that ensures the type is neither CharType nor VoidType.
- **Description**: The `NotVoidChar` class is a specialized type that extends the `Type` class, designed to represent types that are neither `CharType` nor `VoidType`. It is used in the context of analyzing `memcpy` function calls to ensure that the base types of the source and destination pointers are not void or char, which could lead to incorrect size calculations in memory operations.
