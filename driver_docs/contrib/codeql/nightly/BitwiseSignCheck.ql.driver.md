# Purpose
This code is a part of a static analysis tool or a code quality checker, specifically designed to identify potential issues related to the sign checking of bitwise operations in C++ code. It provides narrow functionality, focusing on detecting a specific problem where the sign of the result of a bitwise operation is checked, which can lead to unexpected results if not handled correctly. The code is not an executable or a library but rather a rule or query definition that is likely part of a larger set of rules used to analyze C++ code for reliability and correctness issues. It uses a domain-specific language to define conditions under which a warning should be issued, ensuring high precision in identifying problematic code patterns.
