## Files
- **[codeql-pack.lock.yml](dev/codeql-pack.lock.yml.driver.md)**: The `codeql-pack.lock.yml` file in the `firedancer` codebase specifies the lock version and indicates that there are no dependencies and the code is not compiled.
- **[DeadCodeAfterTerminatingLog.ql](dev/DeadCodeAfterTerminatingLog.ql.driver.md)**: The `DeadCodeAfterTerminatingLog.ql` file in the `firedancer` codebase defines a CodeQL query to identify and warn about dead code that appears after a terminating log function call, such as `FD_LOG_ERR`.
- **[ErrorDiscard.ql](dev/ErrorDiscard.ql.driver.md)**: The `ErrorDiscard.ql` file defines a CodeQL query to identify instances where a function returning an error code is called, but its return value is discarded, flagging it as a warning with low precision.
- **[InconsistentCallOnResult.ql](dev/InconsistentCallOnResult.ql.driver.md)**: The `InconsistentCallOnResult.ql` file in the `firedancer` codebase defines a CodeQL query to identify cases where a function's return value is usually followed by a specific operation (like free, delete, or close), but in some instances, this operation is missing, potentially indicating a misuse of the API and leading to resource leaks.
- **[MacroCmpLiteral.ql](dev/MacroCmpLiteral.ql.driver.md)**: The `MacroCmpLiteral.ql` file in the `firedancer` codebase identifies functions that return a defined integer constant and compare it to a literal value at invocation, flagging it as a maintainability and readability warning.
- **[MaybeWrongConstPure.ql](dev/MaybeWrongConstPure.ql.driver.md)**: The `MaybeWrongConstPure.ql` file in the `firedancer` codebase defines a CodeQL query to identify instances where non-const or non-pure functions are called by functions marked as const or pure, issuing a warning for such occurrences.
- **[MissingEnumCaseInSwitch.ql](dev/MissingEnumCaseInSwitch.ql.driver.md)**: The `MissingEnumCaseInSwitch.ql` file defines a CodeQL query that identifies switch statements over enum types that are missing cases for some enum constants and lack a default case, potentially leading to logic errors.
- **[NonSpecificErrorCodes.ql](dev/NonSpecificErrorCodes.ql.driver.md)**: The `NonSpecificErrorCodes.ql` file is a CodeQL query that identifies functions returning a defined constant on one path and a literal number on another, serving as a low-precision hint during development in the `firedancer` codebase.
- **[qlpack.yml](dev/qlpack.yml.driver.md)**: The `qlpack.yml` file specifies the configuration for a CodeQL package named `asymmetric-research/fd-nightly-queries`, including its version, extractor, and dependencies.
- **[ScratchLayoutMismatch.ql](dev/ScratchLayoutMismatch.ql.driver.md)**: The `ScratchLayoutMismatch.ql` file in the `firedancer` codebase defines a CodeQL query to identify potential mismatches between `FD_LAYOUT_*` and `FD_SCRATCH_ALLOC_*` macros, issuing warnings for detected discrepancies.
- **[VisualizeTopology.ql](dev/VisualizeTopology.ql.driver.md)**: The `VisualizeTopology.ql` file in the `firedancer` codebase defines a query to visualize the topology of a system by extracting and representing tiles and links in JSON and Mermaid formats.
