# Purpose
The provided content is a `Cargo.toml` file, which is a configuration file used by Rust's package manager, Cargo. This file specifies metadata about the Rust package, such as its name, version, and edition. It also lists the dependencies required for the package to compile and run, categorized into regular dependencies, build dependencies, and development dependencies, each with specified versions and optional features. The `[profile.release-with-debug]` section defines a custom build profile that inherits settings from the default `release` profile but includes additional debugging information, allowing for more detailed debugging while maintaining optimizations. This configuration is essential for managing the package's dependencies and build settings efficiently.
