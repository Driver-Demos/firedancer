# Purpose
This Rust code file is a build script, typically named `build.rs`, used in a Rust project to automate the process of compiling Protocol Buffers (protobuf) files into Rust code. The script leverages the `tonic_build` crate to configure and compile gRPC service definitions specified in `.proto` files. The script first checks for the presence of the `PROTOC` environment variable, which specifies the path to the Protocol Buffers compiler. If the variable is not set and the operating system is not Windows, it sets the variable using the `protobuf_src::protoc()` function to ensure the compiler is available.

The script defines a list of protobuf files located in a `protos` directory and iterates over them to prepare for compilation. It uses the `tonic_build::configure` function to set up the build process, specifying that only server code should be generated (`build_client(false)` and `build_server(true)`). Additionally, it applies specific attributes to certain types for testing purposes. The script concludes by invoking the `compile_protos` method to generate the necessary Rust code from the protobuf definitions, ensuring that the build process is re-triggered if any of the `.proto` files change. This build script is crucial for projects that rely on gRPC services, as it automates the integration of protobuf definitions into the Rust codebase.

# Functions

---
### main
The `main` function configures and compiles Protocol Buffers (protobuf) files for a Rust project, setting environment variables and attributes as needed.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function checks if the environment variable 'PROTOC' is set; if not, and if not on Windows, it sets this variable using `protobuf_src::protoc()`.
    - It defines a base path for protobuf files and a list of protobuf file names.
    - It iterates over the list of protobuf files, constructs their full paths, and adds them to a vector while printing a message to rerun the build if any of these files change.
    - The function configures the protobuf compilation using `tonic_build::configure()`, setting options to not build a client, to build a server, and to add specific attributes to certain types.
    - Finally, it compiles the protobuf files using the configured settings and returns the result.
- **Output**: The function returns a `Result<(), std::io::Error>`, indicating success or an I/O error during the process.
