## Folders
- **[protos](bundle-test-server/protos.driver.md)**: The `protos` folder in the `firedancer` codebase contains protocol buffer definitions for various components such as authentication, block engine systems, bundles, network packets, relayers, and shared structures, facilitating communication and data handling within the bundle-test-server.
- **[src](bundle-test-server/src.driver.md)**: The `src` folder in the `firedancer` codebase contains the `main.rs` file, which implements a gRPC server for block engine validation and authentication services.

## Files
- **[build.rs](bundle-test-server/build.rs.driver.md)**: The `build.rs` file in the `firedancer` codebase is responsible for configuring and compiling protocol buffer files for the bundle-test-server, specifically building server code while setting up environment variables and handling file change detection.
- **[Cargo.toml](bundle-test-server/Cargo.toml.driver.md)**: The `Cargo.toml` file in the `firedancer` codebase specifies the package configuration, dependencies, build dependencies, and development dependencies for the `bundle-test-server` project, along with a custom release profile.
