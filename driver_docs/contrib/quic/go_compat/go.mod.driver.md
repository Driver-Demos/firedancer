# Purpose
The provided content is from a Go module configuration file, typically named `go.mod`, which is used to define the module's properties and dependencies for a Go project. The file specifies the module path as `github.com/firedancer-io/firedancer/contrib/quic/go_compat` and sets the Go language version to 1.23.0, which is necessary to enable post-quantum key exchange features. It also specifies the toolchain version as `go1.23.6`, ensuring compatibility with the specified Go version. The `require` sections list both direct and indirect dependencies needed for the module, with direct dependencies being essential for the module's functionality and indirect dependencies being required by the direct dependencies. This configuration ensures that the project has all necessary packages and versions to build and run correctly.
