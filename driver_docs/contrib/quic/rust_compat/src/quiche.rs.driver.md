# Purpose
This Rust source code file defines a function `quiche_to_fdquic`, which integrates the Firedancer and quiche libraries to establish a QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections) server-client communication setup. The function is designed to set up and manage a QUIC server using Firedancer's components, such as UDP sockets and QUIC handling, and a client using the quiche library. The code initializes necessary components like UDP sockets, QUIC configurations, and handles packet capturing if specified by the environment variable `PCAP`. It also sets up a thread to service the Firedancer QUIC and UDP socket components, ensuring continuous operation until a stop condition is met.

The function is a comprehensive example of integrating different networking libraries to achieve a specific communication protocol setup. It demonstrates the use of low-level system calls and memory management, such as allocating memory for UDP sockets and handling asynchronous I/O operations. The code also includes error handling and assertions to ensure the correct setup and operation of the components. This file is likely part of a larger system where it serves as a bridge between different networking libraries, providing a specific functionality of establishing and managing a QUIC connection using both Firedancer and quiche.

# Functions

---
### quiche\_to\_fdquic
The `quiche_to_fdquic` function sets up and manages a QUIC connection using both the Firedancer and quiche libraries, handling network socket creation, QUIC configuration, and packet transmission.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - Create a new UDP socket and Firedancer workspace.
    - Initialize a random number generator and allocate memory for a UDP socket using Firedancer functions.
    - Join the UDP socket to the Firedancer network stack and set its layer to IP.
    - Create a new Firedancer QUIC instance configured as a server and enable retry.
    - Check for a PCAP environment variable to optionally set up packet capture using Firedancer's AIO PCAPNG functions.
    - Set up asynchronous I/O for network transmission and reception based on whether PCAP is enabled.
    - Initialize the Firedancer QUIC instance and spawn a thread to service the UDP socket and QUIC instance until a stop signal is received.
    - Configure a quiche QUIC connection with application protocols and bind it to a local UDP socket.
    - Establish a QUIC connection using quiche, sending and receiving packets until the connection is established.
    - Close the quiche connection and signal the Firedancer thread to stop, then join the thread and halt Firedancer.
- **Output**: The function does not return any value; it performs side effects related to network communication and QUIC connection management.

### tls\_keylog\_cb
The `tls_keylog_cb` function logs TLS key information to a PCAP file for debugging purposes.
- **Inputs**:
    - `_ctx`: A pointer to a context object, which is not used in this function.
    - `line`: A pointer to a C-style string containing the TLS key log line to be written to the PCAP file.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function is defined as an unsafe external C function, indicating it is intended to be used as a callback from C code.
    - It calls `fd_pcapng_fwrite_tls_key_log` to write the TLS key log line to the global PCAP file pointer `PCAP_FILE_GLOB`.
    - The length of the line is calculated using `strlen` and passed to the `fd_pcapng_fwrite_tls_key_log` function.
- **Output**: The function does not return any value; it performs a side effect by writing to a file.
