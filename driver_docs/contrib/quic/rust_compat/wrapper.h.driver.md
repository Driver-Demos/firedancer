# Purpose
This code is a simple C header file that sets up preprocessor directives and includes necessary headers for a project, likely related to network programming or testing. The `#define` statements indicate the presence of certain features or capabilities, such as hosted environments, threading, double precision, and stack allocation with `alloca`. The included headers suggest that the file is part of a larger project involving network protocols, specifically QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections), and possibly packet capture (PCAPNG) and UDP socket operations. This header file is likely used to configure and prepare the environment for compiling and running network-related tests or applications within the Firedancer project.
