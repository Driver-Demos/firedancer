# Purpose
This Rust source code file is a build script, typically named `build.rs`, used in a Rust project to customize the build process. The script is responsible for setting up the environment for linking with native libraries and generating Rust bindings for C/C++ code. It begins by determining the path to the project's root directory using the `CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR` environment variable and constructs paths to the native libraries and include directories. The script specifies the search paths for the Rust compiler to find the static libraries and includes directives to link against several static libraries, such as `fd_quic`, `fd_waltz`, and others, which are likely part of a larger system involving networking, cryptography, and utility functions.

Additionally, the script uses the `bindgen` tool to generate Rust bindings for C/C++ code, allowing Rust code to interface with these native libraries. It specifies a header file, `wrapper.h`, and configures `bindgen` to include specific types, functions, and variables that match certain patterns. The generated bindings are written to a file in the output directory specified by the `OUT_DIR` environment variable. This build script is crucial for projects that need to integrate Rust with existing C/C++ codebases, ensuring that the necessary native components are correctly linked and accessible from Rust.
# Imports and Dependencies

- `std::env`
- `std::path::PathBuf`
- `bindgen`


# Functions

---
### main
The `main` function configures the build environment for a Rust project by setting up library paths, linking static libraries, and generating Rust bindings for C/C++ code.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - Retrieve the `CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR` environment variable to determine the base directory of the project.
    - Construct a `PathBuf` object to represent the build path by navigating up three directories from the manifest directory and appending 'build/native/gcc'.
    - Clone the build path to create a library path, append 'lib', and print a directive to link the Rust compiler to this library path.
    - Iterate over a list of library names, printing directives to link each as a static library and to rerun the build if the corresponding library file changes.
    - Print a directive to link the `stdc++` library statically.
    - Clone the build path again to create an include path and configure a `bindgen::Builder` to generate Rust bindings for C/C++ code, specifying header files and allowed types, functions, and variables.
    - Generate the bindings and write them to a file in the output directory specified by the `OUT_DIR` environment variable.
- **Output**: The function does not return any value, but it outputs build configuration directives to the console and writes generated Rust bindings to a file.
