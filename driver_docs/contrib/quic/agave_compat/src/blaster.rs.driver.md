# Purpose
The provided Rust code defines a function named `blast`, which is designed to send a continuous stream of data packets to a specified destination address. This function utilizes the Solana client and connection cache libraries to establish a connection to the target address, which is resolved from a string to a socket address. The core functionality of the `blast` function is to repeatedly send batches of data, where each batch consists of a random number of packets, each containing a random subset of a predefined buffer of bytes. The buffer is a large array of bytes, and the function uses the `rand` crate to generate random numbers for determining the size and content of each packet within the batch.

The `blast` function is a specialized utility that appears to be used for testing or stress-testing network connections by sending a high volume of data packets. It does not define a public API or external interface, as it is marked with the `pub(crate)` visibility, indicating that it is intended for use within the current crate only. The function leverages the `ConnectionCache` and `ClientConnection` from the Solana libraries to manage network connections efficiently. The use of a loop to continuously send data and the logging of the number of packets sent suggest that this function is intended for scenarios where monitoring the throughput or performance of a network connection is necessary.

### blast
The `blast` function sends random-sized batches of predefined data to a specified destination address using a connection cache.
- **Inputs**:
    - `dst`: A `String` representing the destination address to which data will be sent.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Convert the destination string `dst` into a socket address using `to_socket_addrs` and retrieve the first address.
    - Define a constant buffer `BUF` containing a predefined array of bytes.
    - Create a new QUIC connection cache with a specified name and size, and retrieve a connection for the socket address.
    - Initialize a vector `batch` to hold batches of data to be sent, with a capacity of 1024.
    - Initialize a random number generator `rng` and two counters `sent` and `sent_stat` to track the number of batches sent.
    - Enter an infinite loop where a random number `cnt` is generated to determine the number of data batches to send in this iteration.
    - Clear the `batch` vector and fill it with `cnt` random-sized slices of `BUF`, each converted to a vector.
    - Attempt to send the batch of data using the connection; if an error occurs, print the error message.
    - Increment the `sent` counter by `cnt` and check if the difference between `sent` and `sent_stat` exceeds 10000; if so, print the total number of batches sent and update `sent_stat`.
- **Output**: The function does not return any value; it continuously sends data batches to the specified destination.
