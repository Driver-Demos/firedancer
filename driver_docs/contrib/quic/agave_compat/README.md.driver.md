# Purpose
The file provides instructions for setting up and running an integration test for the `fd_quic` and `solana-streamer` components. It specifies the necessary package installations for Debian and Fedora-based systems, followed by commands to build the project in release mode using Cargo and execute the test as both a server and a client.
