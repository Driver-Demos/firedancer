# Purpose
This code is a shell script that serves as a wrapper to execute the GNU Debugger (GDB) with a specific configuration. It provides narrow functionality, primarily aimed at setting up a debugging environment by automatically sourcing a Python script (`fd_gdb.py`) located in the `contrib/gdb` directory. This script is not an executable in the traditional sense but rather a utility to streamline the debugging process by preloading custom GDB commands or configurations defined in the `fd_gdb.py` file. It is intended to be run from the command line, passing any additional arguments directly to GDB, thus enhancing the debugging experience with predefined settings or extensions.
