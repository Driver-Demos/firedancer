# Purpose
This Python script is designed to interact with the Solana blockchain to analyze and display information about block production schedules. It primarily focuses on retrieving and processing leader schedules for a given public key, which represents a validator or node in the Solana network. The script uses the Solana RPC API to fetch epoch information and leader schedules, then calculates and prints the relative and absolute distances between upcoming slots and the current slot. This information is useful for validators to understand their upcoming responsibilities in block production.

The script is structured as a command-line tool, requiring three arguments: an RPC URL, a public key, and a number of slots to consider. It uses several external libraries, such as `solders` for handling Solana-specific data structures and `pqdm` for potential parallel processing, although the latter is not utilized in the current implementation. The script is intended to be executed directly and does not define any public APIs or external interfaces for use in other programs. Its primary function is to provide insights into the timing and scheduling of block production for a specific validator on the Solana network.

# Functions

---
### usage<!-- {{#callable:firedancer/contrib/tool/block_production.usage}} -->
The `usage` function prints a usage message for the script and exits the program with a status code of 1.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - Prints a usage message indicating the expected command-line arguments for the script.
    - Exits the program with a status code of 1.
- **Output**: The function does not return any value; it exits the program with a status code of 1.


---
### main<!-- {{#callable:firedancer/contrib/tool/block_production.main}} -->
The `main` function retrieves and processes Solana blockchain leader schedule information for a given public key and number of slots, then prints the timing details of upcoming slots.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if the number of command-line arguments is less than 4; if so, call the [`usage`](#usage) function and exit.
    - Create a `Client` object using the first command-line argument as the RPC URL.
    - Convert the second command-line argument to a `Pubkey` object.
    - Convert the third command-line argument to an integer representing the number of slots (`slot_cnt`).
    - Retrieve epoch information using the `client.get_epoch_info()` method.
    - Retrieve the leader schedule for the current epoch using the `client.get_leader_schedule()` method.
    - Extract the leader slot indices for the given public key from the leader schedule.
    - Filter the leader slot indices to find upcoming slots that are greater than the current slot index, limiting the result to four times the number of slots specified (`4*slot_cnt`).
    - Calculate the starting slot of the epoch by subtracting the current slot index from the absolute slot.
    - Iterate over the upcoming slot indices, calculating the slot number, relative slot difference, and distance from the current absolute slot.
    - For each slot, calculate the relative and distance time deltas in milliseconds and print the slot information.
- **Output**: The function outputs formatted information about upcoming slots, including the slot number, relative slot difference, distance from the current slot, and corresponding time deltas.
