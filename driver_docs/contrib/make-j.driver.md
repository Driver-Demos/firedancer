# Purpose
This script is a Bash configuration file designed to optimize the execution of the `make` command in environments with CPU isolation. It first checks if any CPUs are isolated by reading from the `/sys/devices/system/cpu/isolated` file. If no CPUs are isolated, it executes a standard parallel `make` command. However, if CPU isolation is detected, the script employs a more complex setup using `chrt` and `taskset` to ensure that the `make` process runs efficiently on the isolated CPUs. This approach addresses the challenge of running parallel tasks on systems where some cores are isolated from the operating system, ensuring that the build process utilizes the correct number of cores and adheres to real-time scheduling policies.
