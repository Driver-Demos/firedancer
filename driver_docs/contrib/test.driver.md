- **[find_uncovered_fuzz_canaries.py](test/find_uncovered_fuzz_canaries.py.driver.md)**: The `find_uncovered_fuzz_canaries.py` file in the `firedancer` codebase identifies and reports source code lines marked as "canaries" that have not been covered by fuzz testing, using lcov coverage data to filter out covered lines.
- **[run_fd_shred_cap.sh](test/run_fd_shred_cap.sh.driver.md)**: The `run_fd_shred_cap.sh` file is a Bash script used in the `firedancer` codebase to set up, configure, and execute a simulation of the Firedancer development environment, including downloading necessary resources, generating key pairs, and managing configurations and logs.
- **[run_integration_tests.sh](test/run_integration_tests.sh.driver.md)**: The `run_integration_tests.sh` file in the `firedancer` codebase is a Bash script designed to sequentially execute integration tests, with options for verbosity and specific test selection, while ensuring system configuration changes are managed and logging results for each test.
- **[run_script_tests.sh](test/run_script_tests.sh.driver.md)**: The `run_script_tests.sh` file in the `firedancer` codebase is a shell script designed to execute a series of unit tests and log their outputs, with some tests currently disabled due to unresolved issues.
- **[run_test_vectors.sh](test/run_test_vectors.sh.driver.md)**: The `run_test_vectors.sh` file in the `firedancer` codebase is a Bash script that automates the process of fetching, preparing, and executing various test vectors using multiple processes, while logging the results to specified paths.
- **[run_unit_tests.sh](test/run_unit_tests.sh.driver.md)**: The `run_unit_tests.sh` file is a bash script that functions as a NUMA-aware greedy test scheduler, managing the execution of unit tests across multiple NUMA nodes and CPUs while handling memory allocation and job distribution.
- **[setup_fd_cluster.sh](test/setup_fd_cluster.sh.driver.md)**: The `setup_fd_cluster.sh` file is a shell script for setting up a Solana test cluster, including generating keypairs, fetching necessary programs, running the genesis process, and starting a bootstrap validator.
- **[setup_fd_cluster_stakes.sh](test/setup_fd_cluster_stakes.sh.driver.md)**: The `setup_fd_cluster_stakes.sh` file is a Bash script used to set up keypairs, create vote and stake accounts, and delegate stakes for a Solana cluster in the Firedancer project.
