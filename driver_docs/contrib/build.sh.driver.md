# Purpose
The provided file is a Bash script named `build.sh`, which is designed to automate the build process for a software project. This script offers a broad range of functionalities, primarily focusing on compiling the project using different compilers (GCC and Clang) and for various machine types. It includes a comprehensive set of flags and arguments that allow users to customize the build process, such as excluding certain compilers, machines, or targets, and enabling verbose output for debugging purposes. The script also manages dependencies, installs necessary packages, and handles environment setup for different compiler versions. Its relevance to the codebase lies in its ability to streamline the build process, ensuring that the software can be compiled consistently across different environments and configurations, which is crucial for development, testing, and deployment workflows.
# Content Summary
The provided script is a Bash build automation script designed to facilitate the compilation of software projects using different compilers and configurations. It is structured to handle complex build scenarios, including multiple compiler versions, machine types, and build targets. Below is a detailed breakdown of its functionality:

### Key Features and Functionality:

1. **Command-Line Interface:**
   - The script provides a comprehensive command-line interface with various flags and arguments to customize the build process. Key flags include:
     - `--no-gcc`, `--no-clang`: Skip GCC or Clang builds.
     - `--no-deps`, `--no-rust`: Avoid installing dependencies or Rust.
     - `--dry-run`: Display the build matrix without executing builds.
     - `--verbose`: Output detailed logs for failed builds.
     - `--exit-on-err`: Terminate on the first build failure.
     - `--help`: Display usage information.

2. **Build Configuration:**
   - The script allows specifying build targets, machine types, and compiler versions through arguments like `--targets`, `--machines`, `--gcc-versions`, and `--clang-versions`.
   - It supports excluding specific combinations of compilers, machines, and targets using `--gcc-except` and `--clang-except`.

3. **Environment Setup:**
   - The script assumes the presence of compiler versions under `/opt/gcc` and `/opt/clang`, each containing an `activate` script to set up the environment.
   - It installs necessary dependencies and fetches required repositories unless explicitly skipped.

4. **Build Execution:**
   - The script iterates over specified or default compilers and machine types, executing builds for each target.
   - It uses helper functions to determine whether to skip certain compiler, machine, or target combinations based on exclusion lists.
   - The build process is logged, and failures are reported with options to view detailed logs if verbose mode is enabled.

5. **Time Tracking and Logging:**
   - The script tracks and reports the elapsed time for each build phase.
   - It maintains a temporary log file to capture build outputs, which can be displayed in case of errors.

6. **Exit Codes:**
   - The script defines exit codes to indicate the build status, such as successful builds, failed builds, missing environment scripts, or dependency installation failures.

7. **Custom Target Overrides:**
   - It includes predefined target overrides for specific machine types, allowing customization of build targets based on the machine configuration.

This script is a robust tool for managing complex build processes, providing flexibility and control over various build parameters and conditions. It is particularly useful in environments where multiple compiler versions and machine configurations need to be tested and validated.
