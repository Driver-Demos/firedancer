# Purpose
This Rust source code file provides a narrow functionality focused on cryptographic operations using the Ed25519 digital signature algorithm. It defines two primary functions, `ed25519_dalek_sign` and `ed25519_dalek_verify`, which are exposed as C-compatible functions using the `#[no_mangle]` and `extern "C"` attributes. This indicates that the code is intended to be used as a library that can be called from other programming languages, particularly those that can interface with C, such as C++ or Python. The `ed25519_dalek_sign` function generates a digital signature for a given message using a provided public and private key pair, while the `ed25519_dalek_verify` function verifies the authenticity of a message against a given signature and public key.

The code leverages the `ed25519-dalek` crate, which is a Rust implementation of the Ed25519 signature scheme. Key technical components include the use of `Keypair`, `PublicKey`, `SecretKey`, and `Signature` types from the `ed25519-dalek` library to handle cryptographic operations. The functions use unsafe Rust code to manipulate raw pointers, which is necessary for interoperability with C, but also requires careful handling to ensure memory safety. The functions return an integer status code, with `0` indicating success and `-1` indicating failure, which is a common convention in C libraries. This file is a focused implementation of cryptographic signing and verification, designed to be integrated into larger systems that require secure message authentication.

# Functions

---
### ed25519\_dalek\_sign
The `ed25519_dalek_sign` function generates an Ed25519 signature for a given message using a provided public and private key pair.
- **Inputs**:
    - `sig`: A mutable pointer to a buffer where the generated signature will be stored.
    - `msg`: A constant pointer to the message data that needs to be signed.
    - `sz`: The size of the message in bytes.
    - `public_key`: A constant pointer to the public key bytes used in the key pair.
    - `private_key`: A constant pointer to the private key bytes used in the key pair.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Attempt to create a `SecretKey` from the provided private key bytes; return -1 if unsuccessful.
    - Attempt to create a `PublicKey` from the provided public key bytes; return -1 if unsuccessful.
    - Construct a `Keypair` using the successfully created `SecretKey` and `PublicKey`.
    - Sign the message using the `Keypair` and store the resulting signature in the provided `sig` buffer.
    - Return 0 to indicate successful signing.
- **Output**: Returns a `c_int` which is 0 on success and -1 on failure.


---
### ed25519\_dalek\_verify
The `ed25519_dalek_verify` function verifies an Ed25519 signature against a given message and public key.
- **Inputs**:
    - `msg`: A pointer to the message data that needs to be verified.
    - `sz`: The size of the message in bytes.
    - `sig`: A pointer to the signature data that needs to be verified.
    - `public_key`: A pointer to the public key used for verification.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Convert the signature from a byte array to a `Signature` object using `Signature::from_bytes`; return -1 if conversion fails.
    - Convert the public key from a byte array to a `PublicKey` object using `PublicKey::from_bytes`; return -1 if conversion fails.
    - Use the `verify_strict` method of the `PublicKey` object to verify the message against the signature; check if the result is `Ok`.
    - Return 0 if the verification is successful, otherwise return -1.
- **Output**: Returns 0 if the signature is successfully verified, otherwise returns -1.
