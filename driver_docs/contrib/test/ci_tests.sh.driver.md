# Purpose
The provided script, `ci_tests.sh`, is a shell script designed to automate the process of building and running tests within a Continuous Integration (CI) environment. It ensures that all necessary tests are executed on every commit, potentially exporting coverage data if configured to do so. The script begins by setting up the environment, checking for required variables such as `MACHINES` and `TARGETS`, and then iterates over each machine specified to build and test the code. It supports additional configurations through the `EXTRAS` variable, allowing for specific test scenarios like fuzz testing or coverage analysis with `llvm-cov`. The script also includes functionality to export a coverage report if the `COV_REPORT` variable is set, ensuring comprehensive test coverage and reporting.
