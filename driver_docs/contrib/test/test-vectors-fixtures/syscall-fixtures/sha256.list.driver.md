# Purpose
The provided file contents represent a list of file paths that are likely part of a test suite for verifying the functionality of a SHA-256 hashing implementation within a software system. Each file path points to a fixture file located in the `dump/test-vectors/syscall/fixtures/sha256/` directory, with each file having a unique identifier, such as `h0_08bcfe140cc49f7a.fix`, which suggests a specific test case or input-output pair for the SHA-256 algorithm. These fixture files are used to ensure that the system's syscall handling of SHA-256 operations produces the expected results, thereby validating the correctness and reliability of the cryptographic functionality. The systematic naming convention and organization of these files facilitate automated testing and regression analysis, ensuring that any changes to the codebase do not introduce errors in the hashing process.
