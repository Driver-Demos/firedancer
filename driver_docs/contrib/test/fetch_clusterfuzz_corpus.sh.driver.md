# Purpose
This Bash script is designed to automate the process of downloading the latest corpus data from a Google Cloud Storage bucket associated with ClusterFuzz, a fuzzing infrastructure. The script provides a narrow functionality focused on managing and updating the corpus data for fuzz testing, which is crucial for software testing and security analysis. It is an executable script that performs a series of operations: it clears any existing corpus directory, lists directories in a specified Google Cloud Storage path, and iteratively downloads and extracts the latest corpus files into a structured local directory. The script is marked as "Destructive" because it removes the existing corpus directory before downloading new data, ensuring that only the latest corpus is retained.
