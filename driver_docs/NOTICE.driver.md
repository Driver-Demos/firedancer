This file serves as a legal and informational resource, ensuring compliance with open-source licenses and acknowledging the contributions of external projects. It covers a wide range of cryptographic algorithms and libraries, such as xxHash, MurmurHash3, OpenSSL, and others, each with specific licensing terms like BSD, Apache, MIT, and public domain. The document is crucial for developers and legal teams to understand the legal obligations and rights associated with using and modifying these components. It also provides references to the original sources and modifications made, ensuring transparency and traceability within the codebase.
# Content Summary
This document provides a comprehensive overview of various cryptographic and utility implementations within a software codebase, detailing their origins, modifications, and licensing terms. It serves as a crucial reference for developers working with these components, ensuring compliance with licensing requirements and understanding the modifications made to the original implementations.

1. **Hashing Algorithms**: The codebase includes modified implementations of several hashing algorithms. The `fd_hash` and `fd_hash_memcpy` functions are based on the xxHash algorithm, specifically versions r39 and xxHash3. The `fd_uint_hash` and `fd_ulong_hash` functions utilize the fmix32 and fmix64 functions from MurmurHash3. These implementations are subject to their respective licenses, including the BSD 2-Clause License for xxHash and public domain dedication for MurmurHash3.

2. **Cryptographic Hash Functions**: The SHA-512 and SHA-256 implementations are derived from OpenSSL's implementations, with modifications to fit the codebase's style. The document provides links to the OpenSSL license, which governs these implementations. Additionally, the BLAKE3 and SipHash implementations are based on their respective open-source projects, with BLAKE3 licensed under the Apache License 2.0 and SipHash dedicated to the public domain.

3. **Encryption Algorithms**: The AES-ECB and AES-GCM implementations are adapted from OpenSSL, with significant modifications. The document details the specific OpenSSL sources used and the resulting Firedancer sources. The high-performance AES-GCM implementation for x86 is adapted from contributions to the Linux kernel by Eric Biggers, licensed under Apache-2.0 OR BSD-2-Clause.

4. **Digital Signature and Key Exchange**: The ed25519 and X25519 implementations are based on OpenSSL and the Go standard library, respectively. These implementations are optimized and modified to integrate with the codebase's API, with licensing details provided for both OpenSSL and Go.

5. **Utility Libraries**: The codebase includes several utility libraries, such as the Nanopb library for protocol buffers, PicoHTTPParser for HTTP parsing, and cJSON for JSON parsing. Each library is accompanied by its respective license, such as the MIT License for PicoHTTPParser and cJSON, and a custom license for Nanopb.

6. **Additional Components**: The document also covers other components like the ChaCha20 stream cipher, the UTF-8 validator derived from the Rust standard library, and the secp256k1 library for elliptic curve cryptography. Each component's licensing terms are clearly stated, ensuring developers are aware of their obligations when using or modifying these components.

Overall, this document is essential for developers to navigate the legal and technical landscape of the codebase, ensuring proper usage and modification of third-party and open-source software components.
