# Purpose
This file is a Makefile snippet configuring the build process to enable AddressSanitizer (ASan) and LeakSanitizer for the software project. It sets preprocessor and compiler flags to define macros indicating the presence of ASan and DeepASan, and it adds the necessary flags to `CPPFLAGS`, `CFLAGS`, and `LDFLAGS` to activate address and leak sanitization during compilation and linking.
