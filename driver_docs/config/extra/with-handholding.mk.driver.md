# Purpose
This file is a Makefile snippet that sets preprocessor flags for a C/C++ build process. Each line appends a definition to the `CPPFLAGS` variable, enabling a "handholding" mode for various components of the software, likely to facilitate debugging or development by providing additional checks or verbose output.
