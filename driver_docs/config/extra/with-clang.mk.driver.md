# Purpose
The provided content is a Makefile, which is a configuration file used by the `make` build automation tool to compile and link programs. This particular Makefile is configured to use the Clang compiler (`clang` for C and `clang++` for C++), as indicated by the `CC`, `CXX`, and `LD` variables. The file addresses specific issues encountered when using Clang, such as disabling strict checks that prevent obtaining the address of packed structure elements, which is necessary for real-world packet parsing. It also mentions disabling strict Clang builds that fail due to unused command line arguments when assembling `.s` files, suggesting a workaround rather than modifying the entire build system. The `CPPFLAGS` and `FD_USING_CLANG` variables are set to indicate the use of Clang, allowing other parts of the build system to adjust accordingly. Additionally, the `LDFLAGS` variable is updated to include the `-lstdc++` library, which is not automatically linked by `clang++`.
