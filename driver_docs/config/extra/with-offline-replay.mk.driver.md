# Purpose
This Makefile snippet includes an additional makefile, `config/extra/with-handholding.mk`, and sets preprocessor and compiler flags. The flags `-DFD_SPAD_TRACK_USAGE=1` and `-DFD_OFFLINE_REPLAY=1` are added to both `CPPFLAGS` and `CFLAGS`, enabling specific features or behaviors in the code related to tracking usage and offline replay functionality.
