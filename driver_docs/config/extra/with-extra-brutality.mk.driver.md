# Purpose
This file is a Makefile snippet that configures compiler flags for a C/C++ project. It defines preprocessor flags to add attributes for function purity and constancy, and conditionally adds warning and diagnostic flags based on whether the Clang or GCC compiler is being used. The flags enhance code analysis and diagnostics by suggesting attributes and enabling colored output for GCC.
