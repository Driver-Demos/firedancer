# Purpose
The provided content is a Makefile script used for configuring the build process of a software project, specifically handling cross-compilation for ARM architectures. The script first checks the machine architecture using `uname -m` and sets a `CROSS` variable if the architecture is neither `aarch64` nor `arm64`, indicating a cross-compilation scenario. If cross-compiling, it adjusts the compiler and linker settings to use ARM-specific tools, such as setting the `TARGET` to `aarch64-linux-gnu` and modifying the `CPPFLAGS` and `LDFLAGS`. It also conditionally sets the compiler and linker variables based on whether GCC or Clang is being used. If not cross-compiling, the script includes additional configuration files for various libraries and features, such as ucontext, secp256k1, zstd, lz4, openssl, and rocksdb. The script concludes by setting a variable `FD_ARCH_SUPPORTS_SANDBOX` to indicate architecture support for sandboxing.
