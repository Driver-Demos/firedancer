# Purpose
The provided file content is a configuration script, likely part of a Makefile, used to set up compiler and linker flags for a software project that utilizes AddressSanitizer (ASan) for detecting memory errors such as buffer overflows and memory leaks. The script defines a flag `FD_HAS_ASAN` to indicate the presence of ASan and appends specific flags to `CPPFLAGS` and `LDFLAGS` to enable address and leak sanitization during compilation and linking. Additionally, when using the GCC compiler, it includes flags to suppress certain warnings and disable stack protection to avoid false positives and misalignments, which are noted as potential bugs in GCC when ASan is enabled. This configuration ensures that the software is built with enhanced memory error detection capabilities, improving its robustness and reliability during development and testing.
