# Purpose
The file contains a configuration directive for a build system, likely a Makefile. It appends a linker flag (`-Wl,-rpath,${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}`) to `LDFLAGS`, which instructs the linker to set the runtime library search path to the directories specified in the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable. This ensures that the linked libraries are found at runtime.
