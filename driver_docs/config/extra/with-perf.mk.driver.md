# Purpose
The file contains a makefile configuration line that appends specific compiler flags to the `CPPFLAGS` variable. The flags `-fno-omit-frame-pointer` and `-fno-inline` are used to modify the behavior of the C++ compiler, ensuring that frame pointers are not omitted and inlining is disabled, which can be useful for debugging and profiling purposes.
