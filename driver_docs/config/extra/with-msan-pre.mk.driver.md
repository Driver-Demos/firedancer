# Purpose
This file is a Makefile snippet configuring the build process for a project using MemorySanitizer. It specifies that all dependencies must be recompiled with the `-fsanitize=memory` flag and sets the `OPT` and `LIBCXX` variables to `opt-msan`, indicating the use of a specific build configuration optimized for MemorySanitizer.
