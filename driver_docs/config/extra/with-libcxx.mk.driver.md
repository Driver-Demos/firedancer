# Purpose
The provided content is a configuration snippet, likely from a Makefile, that facilitates the replacement of the default C++ standard library with libc++. This is particularly useful for developers who need to build their projects with MemorySanitizer (MSan), a tool for detecting memory errors in C/C++ programs. The file includes instructions for setting up the libc++ environment by cloning the LLVM project, configuring it with CMake, and building the necessary components. It checks if the `LIBCXX` environment variable is set, which should point to the directory containing the built libc++ libraries. The configuration modifies the compiler flags (`CXXFLAGS` and `LDFLAGS`) to exclude the default C++ standard library and include the headers and libraries from the specified libc++ path, ensuring that the project is compiled and linked against libc++.
