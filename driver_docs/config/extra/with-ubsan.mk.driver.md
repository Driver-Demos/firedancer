# Purpose
The provided content is a configuration snippet, likely from a Makefile, that sets up compiler and linker flags for a C/C++ project to enable various undefined behavior sanitizers. The file defines two variables, `FD_HAS_UBSAN` and `FD_UNALIGNED_ACCESS_STYLE`, and appends them to `CPPFLAGS` to ensure these settings are included during the compilation process. The `LDFLAGS` and `CPPFLAGS` are augmented with `-fsanitize=undefined` and a comprehensive list of specific sanitizers, such as `shift`, `integer-divide-by-zero`, and `null`, among others. These flags are used to detect and report undefined behaviors during runtime, which aids developers in identifying and fixing potential bugs and vulnerabilities in the code. The initial comment suggests a cautionary note about the order of flag application to prevent certain optimizations from overriding the intended settings.
