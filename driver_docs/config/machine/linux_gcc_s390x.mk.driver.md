# Purpose
This file is a Makefile, which is used to automate the build process of a software project. It specifies the build directory as `linux/gcc/s390x` and includes several configuration files to extend its functionality, such as `config/base.mk` and various `config/extra/*.mk` files for additional features like optimization, debugging, and security. The file sets compiler flags (`CPPFLAGS` and `LDFLAGS`) and checks the machine architecture to determine if cross-compilation is necessary, setting the appropriate cross-compiler tools (`CC`, `CXX`, `LD`) for the `s390x` architecture. It also defines and appends preprocessor flags to enable specific features like 128-bit integers, double precision, and stack allocation. This configuration ensures that the build process is tailored to the target architecture and includes necessary optimizations and features.
