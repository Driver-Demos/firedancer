# Purpose
The provided content is a Makefile, which is used to automate the build process of a software project. This Makefile is specifically configured for building software on a Power9 architecture using the GCC compiler. It sets up various flags and includes additional configuration files to tailor the build process, such as enabling optimizations, debugging, security features, and multi-threading support. The file also checks the machine architecture and sets up cross-compilation tools if the architecture is not `ppc64le`, ensuring compatibility with different environments. The `CPPFLAGS` and `LDFLAGS` are defined to include specific compiler and linker options, enhancing the build process with architecture-specific optimizations and capabilities.
