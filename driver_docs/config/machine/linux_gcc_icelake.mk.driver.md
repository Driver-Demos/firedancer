# Purpose
The provided content is a Makefile, which is used to automate the build process of a software project. This particular Makefile is configured to build a project targeting the Intel Ice Lake architecture using the GCC compiler. It includes several configuration files that add specific build options, such as debugging, security, optimization, and threading capabilities. The `CPPFLAGS` variable is set with compiler flags that enable various CPU features like AVX, SSE, and AES-NI, which are specific to the Ice Lake architecture. Additionally, the Makefile checks the GCC compiler version to conditionally enable AVX-512 support, ensuring compatibility with the compiler's capabilities.
