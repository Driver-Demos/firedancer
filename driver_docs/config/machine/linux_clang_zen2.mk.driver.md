# Purpose
The provided content is a Makefile, which is used to automate the build process of a software project. The `BUILDDIR` variable specifies the directory structure for the build, targeting a Linux environment with Clang compiler optimizations for the Zen 2 architecture. The file includes several configuration files, each adding specific build options such as debugging, security, optimization, and threading capabilities. The `CPPFLAGS` are set to include specific compiler flags that define macros and enable certain processor features, such as support for 128-bit integers, double precision, and various x86 instruction set extensions like SSE, AVX, and AES-NI. These settings ensure that the build process is tailored to leverage specific hardware capabilities and compiler features for optimized performance.
