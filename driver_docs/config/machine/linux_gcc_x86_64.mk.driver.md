# Purpose
The provided content is a Makefile, which is used to automate the build process of a software project. The `BUILDDIR` variable specifies the directory structure for the build, indicating a target environment of Linux with GCC for the x86_64 architecture. The file includes several other Makefiles from the `config` directory, each likely containing specific configurations for different build features such as debugging, security, optimization, and threading. The `CPPFLAGS` are compiler flags that optimize the build for specific CPU architectures (Haswell and Skylake) and enable various features like 128-bit integers, double precision, and advanced instruction sets (SSE and AVX). The repeated definitions of `FD_HAS_*` variables suggest these features are being explicitly enabled for the build process, ensuring the compiled software can leverage these capabilities.
