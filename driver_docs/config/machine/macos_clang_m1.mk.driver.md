# Purpose
This file is a Makefile, which is used to automate the build process of a software project, specifically targeting the macOS platform with Clang on an Apple M1 chip. The `BUILDDIR` variable specifies the directory structure for the build, indicating a focus on macOS with Clang for the M1 architecture. The file includes several other Makefiles, such as `base.mk` and additional configuration files for Clang, debugging, and optimization, which likely contain further build instructions and settings. The file sets preprocessor flags (`CPPFLAGS`) to define various macros that control the compilation process, such as enabling support for 128-bit integers, double precision, and atomic operations, while also specifying the target CPU architecture. Comments in the file suggest the use of LLVM tools installed via Homebrew and note certain configurations that are temporary until broader support is implemented for macOS.
