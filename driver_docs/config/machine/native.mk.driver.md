# Purpose
This file is a Makefile, which is used to automate the build process of a software project. It provides narrow functionality by configuring the compilation environment based on the detected compiler and its capabilities. The file contains several conceptual components, such as compiler detection, feature checks, and conditional inclusion of configuration files. It determines whether the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) or Clang is being used and sets appropriate flags and variables accordingly. The file also checks for specific hardware and software features, such as AVX, SSE, and threading support, and includes additional configuration files based on these capabilities. This Makefile is crucial for ensuring that the software is built with the correct optimizations and configurations tailored to the target system's architecture and compiler capabilities.
# Content Summary
This file is a Makefile script used for configuring a build environment based on the detected compiler and system capabilities. It primarily focuses on setting up compiler flags and including specific configuration files based on the compiler being used and the features supported by the system's CPU architecture.

Key technical details include:

1. **Compiler Detection and Configuration**: 
   - The script uses the `CC` variable to determine the compiler, defaulting to `gcc` if not specified. It checks if the compiler is Clang or GCC using the `check-define` macro, which evaluates whether certain preprocessor macros (`__clang__`, `__GNUC__`) are defined.
   - Depending on the detected compiler, it includes different configuration files (`config/base.mk`, `config/extra/with-gcc.mk`, `config/extra/with-clang.mk`) and sets the appropriate compiler and linker commands (`CC`, `CXX`, `LD`).

2. **Feature Detection**:
   - The `map-define` macro is used to check for specific CPU features and define corresponding flags. It evaluates whether certain CPU instruction set extensions (e.g., `__SHA__`, `__SSE4_2__`, `__AVX2__`, `__AVX512IFMA__`) are supported and sets flags like `FD_HAS_SHANI`, `FD_HAS_SSE`, `FD_HAS_AVX`, etc.
   - The script also checks for the presence of threading support (`FD_HAS_THREADS`) and 64-bit architecture (`FD_IS_X86_64`).

3. **Conditional Compilation**:
   - The script conditionally includes additional configuration files based on detected features, such as threading support (`config/extra/with-threads.mk`) and 64-bit architecture (`config/extra/with-x86-64.mk`).
   - It handles special cases for AVX512 support, disabling it for older GCC versions (less than 10) due to incomplete support.

4. **Build Directories and Flags**:
   - The `BUILDDIR` variable is set to a directory path that includes the compiler name, facilitating organized build outputs.
   - Compiler flags (`CPPFLAGS`, `RUSTFLAGS`) are set to optimize for the native architecture (`-march=native`, `-mtune=native`).

5. **Informational Output**:
   - The script provides informational messages about the features being used, such as SSE, AVX, AVX512, GFNI, SHANI, and AESNI, which can be useful for debugging and verification purposes.

Overall, this Makefile script is designed to dynamically configure the build environment based on the system's compiler and CPU capabilities, ensuring that the software is optimized for the target architecture.
