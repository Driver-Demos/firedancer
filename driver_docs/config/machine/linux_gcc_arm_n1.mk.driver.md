# Purpose
The provided content is from a Makefile, which is used to automate the build process of a software project. This particular Makefile is configured for building software on ARM architecture, specifically targeting ARMv8.4-A server CPUs like Neoverse V1 or AWS Graviton3. It includes several configuration files that add specific build options, such as GCC compiler settings, ARM architecture support, and various build optimizations like security, debugging, and threading. The file also sets preprocessor flags (`CPPFLAGS`) to specify the target CPU and enable certain features like 128-bit integers, double precision floating-point support, and dynamic memory allocation with `alloca`. The comments indicate that the ARM CPU support is experimental, suggesting that users should anticipate potential issues.
