# Purpose
The provided content is from a Makefile, which is used to automate the build process of a software project. The `BUILDDIR` variable specifies the directory structure for the build, indicating that the build is configured for a Linux environment using the Clang compiler on an x86_64 architecture. The file includes several configuration files that tailor the build process with specific features such as debugging, security, optimization, and multithreading. The `CPPFLAGS` are compiler flags that optimize the build for specific CPU architectures (Haswell and Skylake) and enable certain features like 128-bit integers, double precision, and various x86 instruction sets (SSE, AVX). The comments indicate limitations with Clang's optimization capabilities, suggesting that its current use is primarily for code hygiene rather than performance optimization.
