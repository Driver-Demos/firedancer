# Purpose
The provided content is from a Makefile, which is used to automate the build process of a software project. This Makefile is configured to build a project targeting the RISC-V architecture using the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC). It sets up the build directory and includes several configuration files to extend its functionality, such as enabling optimizations, debugging, security features, and threading. The file also conditionally sets up cross-compilation tools if the host machine is not a PowerPC 64-bit Little Endian (ppc64le) architecture, specifying the use of RISC-V specific compilers and linkers. Additionally, it defines and appends preprocessor flags to enable certain features like 128-bit integers, double precision, and dynamic memory allocation using `alloca`.
