# Purpose
The provided content is a Makefile, which is a configuration file used by the `make` build automation tool to compile and link programs. This Makefile defines various variables and flags that control the build process for a software project. It specifies directories, compiler options, and tools to be used, such as `gcc` for C compilation and `g++` for C++ compilation, along with their respective flags like `CFLAGS` and `CXXFLAGS`. The file also includes settings for handling Rust code, LLVM toolchain utilities, and parameters for libFuzzer tests. Additionally, it defines commands for file operations like copying, removing, and patching, as well as utilities for profiling and coverage analysis. The Makefile is designed to streamline the build process by setting default values and allowing for customization through environment variables.
